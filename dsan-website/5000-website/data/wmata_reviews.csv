I have been greeted with so many warm smiles and friendly directions and guidance to the shuttles!!!! Ty All! Hey, and honorable mention on the increase in security on and around the trains!!! In the past I have been harassed on 3 different occasions, and was seriously thinking of driving to work. As of recently, I'm quite comfortable knowing security is visible and obtainable quickly. Keep up the improvements and great work!!! Thank you!"

Maintenance seems to be the #1 issue, followed by people jumping fare gates. It wouldn't seem so bad if it happens once in a while, but to see it happening every since time I go through fare gates as I'm coming and going is a little much by people who don't care who else they affect"

I am concerned to take the metro since I am a turist but the metro was somewhat clean. I downloaded the metro app and it was very helpful. Very easy to travel to all areas I needed to go. I will highly recommend the use of the metro when traveling and visiting DC.My full day pass cost $12.00
7,1 star rating,"Sep 11, 2023","Less than zero. Some bureaucrat decided to replace all the metro maps on the platforms with advertising monitors that only show a metro map once every 20 ads or five minutes so forget about using one to figure out your route. It's the ultimate insult to customers. It says ""we literally DO NOT CARE if you get where you're going so long as our advertisements generate revenue."
8,3 star rating,"Jul 27, 2022",The Georgia Avenue Limited Line is the Bus 79 Metro Express between Chinatown and Silver Spring.The limited number of stops has advantages to theBus 70 on the same route. The idea and effort is tobe commended. There is a definite need to easilyconnect these two areas overlooked by Metro routes. The fares are currently the WMATA regular bus fare.Time saved is probably not worth a premium bus fare.

Then you figured the trains could drive themselves. Until the other part of the system malfunctioned and 18ish people died. Then you figured high tech trains would solve. Until your crappy tracks broke them. In between, you retired the old metro cards until you retired the new metro cards. Then the wave of the future hit. A million layers of security to transfer a metro card with $5 dollars on it to the lap. Including having the actual metro cards because that is"

14,1.5 star rating,,"The DC metro is pretty awesome! Having lived in several cities, I find this metro to be easier to navigate, cleaner, cheaper, and more reliable than metros I have taken elsewhere (especially in the northeast)! Sure, maybe not the most luxurious mode of transportation, but we are lucky to have this system in DC which enables us to travel around our city with minimal impact to traffic or pollution.Pros:Cleanliness: The metro is extremely clean, in my opinion. Compared to metros in other major cities that I have taken, each stop is generally taken care of, smells ok, and I never feel disgusted sitting on the metro. You do of course see rats sometimes, but this is pretty much commonplace in every metro system, I believe.Easy to navigate: It is easy to navigate the metro system in DC. The cars will update to tell you which stop is next. Maps are present at each stop, and operating the machines to get a ticket is pretty easy as well. If you are confused or in need of direction, I have found the metro employees to be generally friendly and helpful as well.Price: The price of taking the metro in DC is awesome. You can get a pass for multiple rides which will account to some savings, if you are taking the metro frequently. If not, you can ride most places for about $2 a ride. This definitely beats the price of Uber, Lyft and Taxis if you are willing to walk a little to the stops.Reliability/Speed: I find the metro to be decently reliable. It does occasionally run a couple minutes late, but generally arrives on time, and doesn't encounter too many delays compared to other subway systems I have ridden on.Airport Access: If you need to get from DC to the Airport, let me assure you that taking the metro is the fastest and cheapest way to go (unless you have a lot of bags to carry, I suppose, in which it might be nice to get a ride). The blue line pulls up right next to the airport, though, and makes it a very convenient ride.Crowdedness: The metro doesn't seem to be as crowded as other subways I have taken. I tend to get a bit claustrophobic when I am pushed up too close to someone, but I have always felt very comfortable taking the metro around DC.Cons:I will say that the only con I have sometimes is that I live in Georgetown, and there is no metro stop super close to where I live in particular. Foggy bottom and Dupont Circle metro are within a 15-25 minute walk fro me, but there is nothing super close, which is a little bit of a bummer sometimes!"

17,1 star rating,"Jul 19, 2022","Explain to me how the bus spontaneously comes 5 minutes earlier than the scheduled time just because... or how the bus just never shows up, even though it says arriving and departing on the map while you're literally standing there at the stop... or how your only form of communication about a new stop location is in bold typing on a piece of computer paper taped to a window. The train and the bus have been late many times before, but I've made it work. The train has broken down before, but I've made it work. The bus hasn't shown up before, but I've made it work. However, today was extremely unacceptable. I know COVID has hit your system extremely hard but there is absolutely no reason your communication and knowledge on a situation is this terrible. My normal stop is at DOCTORS HOSPITAL RDWY & BUS SHELTER which services the G12 or PG16. These buses run every 30 minutes to an hour and if you miss one, you just have to wait for the next. Even before today, this stop has a history of buses that never show up or end up arriving extremely late.This morning, I got there on time praying at least one of them would show up. There was a piece of printer paper taped to the window saying ""until further notice, the bus will not stop here, but at the 7/11."" This hospital is on a hill, but the 7/11 is down the hill and around the corner. I'm looking at the older woman standing next to me with her cane, trying to figure out what to do since we now have to rush to the 7/11. I was able to get her to the professional entrance of the hospital where she was able to call an Uber, because again, we're on a hill! I finally made it to the 7/11 only for the bus to stop nearly 2 blocks BEHIND the store. I'm standing there trying to flag down the driver to at least ask a question and we're throwing hand signals at each other since he can't open the door. I was finally able to understand that he wasn't stopping at the store, but a block and a half past it. The store is at a busy intersection and NOW, I have to run through the light to catch the bus. When I finally got on, I asked if he knew he was supposed to stop at the store and that there was a paper at the stop saying the location had changed...  ""I wouldn't know since I don't go back there."" He wasn't even aware there was a stop change! How could he be?! From the piece of paper that could've blown away at any minute? WMATA, let me tell you something... it doesn't make any sense that I literally had to run a marathon today just to catch the bus. I didn't even know who to be upset with this morning."

I enjoyed reading my books for a 45 minute ride. I enjoyed experiencing the No Pants Day during the Winter Season. I enjoyed riding the subway during Halloween and seeing people dressed up. I will never forget seeing a woman dressed up like Olive Oyl getting into a argument with her boyfriend dressed up as Popeye.I will never forget the homeless man stinking up the whole subway car. The smell hit everyone's nose like a ton of bricks..The only thing worse than the homeless man were the delays on the train. Several times it caused me to be late for work and nearly fired.  The other problem I have experienced are the horrible personalities of some station managers. I have asked a legitimate question and got 15 second pause before he answer in a not so nice tone.  WTF!? Hopeful hiring people with better manners is something that is being done.The Subway had a lot of problems going on, but I hope they have been able to turn this problem around. I haven't been on the subway or bus transit system for a while. I am curious to see what has changed in the years I have been away from them. I hope they are better now."

Now they refuse to refund the $28.30 that was left on the card, even though they readily admit that I returned the card and all records show that amount remains on the card. They pass you from person to person, no one knows the other... they all have a different story and none make sense. They just wear you down and keep your money. I believe someone is skimming and no one wants to admit it.    Best advice...do NOT give them credit card number to ""auto load"". Instead, add to your card with cash or CC on your own so they cannot ""auto load"", charge your CC, then refuse to refund unused amount."

I wish all regional buses would jump on the same bandwagon. as for WMATA, 2 stars now because I was offered some assistance... but at the end of the day, I will stick with not loading any kind of passes to my card and just pay cash at the fare box to add money to my card, seems any other option for adding money to a card takes hours or even days.... they need to step up their game when it comes to the online purchase of adding to a card."

25,2 star rating,"Apr 8, 2017","After relying on metro rail and buses for a solid two years, I just one of the worst disappointments today. The 16B bus never showed up, and I gave up after about 40 minutes. To think that there must be others like me who ride the bus to work and some person/people's doing/not doing their job affects our ability to get to our workplaces on time outrages me at least a little bit.What is with the live schedule data, by the way? There's ""old data,"" ""scheduled data"" and unspecified data, and in today's case, none of them reflected the actual running of the bus service. Let me also mention how reliably late at least the 16B route buses are, and that I honesty cannot count the times I have been forced to be late for work because of this unreliability. On a positive note, I appreciate that there is a public transit system at all, especially for those who do not have a private means of transit."
26,4 star rating,"Jun 26, 2016","As a relatively new resident of the DC/Virginia, I want to focus on what works for me and the benefits of the Metro service for my current needs. I think WMATA provides a decent system of public transport trough rail and bus service. Sure, the expected ""major"" service disruptions due to SafeTrack add a little anxiety because I regularly rely on the Metro for commute, and I've heard that this major repair work is a result of years -some say decades- of neglect and mismanagement. Maybe the disruptions will be so great that I might feel differently about WMATA weeks and months down the track, but for now and so far, it has been pretty great and reliable. And it looks heaps better than the NYC subway! There have been several occasions where I felt like making a formal complaint but decided not to, including one time at Rosslyn station the blue line trainer people out but shut the doors so quickly after people got odd that dozens of people including me didn't get a chance to board the train. I hope they keep improving and complete the system upgrade successfully."

With the price based on your starting and ending points, I'm still wondering why they are short on revenue, but being short on revenue is the story of most mass transit systems. Almost half  of the system is underground. I didn't experience any of my trains being delayed (which I know was a major complaint among the locals). However, I did experience escalators being out of service and being serviced at every station.  Rush hour was a breeze, no issues as far as missing connected trains.  The stations could use more lighting on the platforms  ."

Here I am at Grosvenor and I find out that trains are running 30 minutes behind... so my day is already ruined thinking I'm be on time to an event, i had to wait for the old train to go to the slim shady station and come back here... friends asking me where am I! So almost 45 minutes later the train arrives... then a few stops later a lady enters with her flea infested canine. It was in a dirty knap sack with no vest. Obviously not a service animal. Then a young cat decided to sit next to me smelling like a brewery and decides to eat his cheetos and ice tea and leave his trash on the seat when his stop came. This scenario is all to common on metro. At Chinatown metro you see all types of mice and large rats running through the platforms. Don't take the Green line going into D.C. At night either.

The trains are now single tracking which causes major delays especially now. General manager hasn't done much through the years and now all of the sudden is making drastic changes. At times when I'm on the green line or red train stops in the tunnels for long periods of time without notice. Fares always increase yet service continues to deteriorate. Kids on the trains run the show during  PM rush hour. As of June 3rd the subway closes at midnight, so they can supposedly fix the issues. Something they should have done from the beginning. Not good for club goers or club promoters. Be on guard when on the train especially on the green line, leave early and plan ahead because there will always be delays. Worst lines are red and green line. Avoid metro center stop. No air. Very few train cabins during rush hour."

The passengers get out the station NO BUS ANYWHERE TO BE SEEN. People are scrambling to access Uber, Lyft reception was bad so the buffering continued in addition to no cars being available. One of metro constituents announces SHUTTLE BUS WILL BE ARRIVING! In ten minutes or!! NO BUS EVER CAME unless it came after I access my Lyft. It was well over an hour of waiting. Chicago has a system that runs above ground and it's robust in sound never have you heard of the mis fractions that continue to occur on this system. NY has a very very extensive system you never hear of derailments NOTHING compared to what I've experienced upon my arrival to DC. Clearly the ball is being dropped in reference to improving the mis fractions that continues to occur. I pray Sincerely that WMATA will rectify all that continues occur.

And especially to our  vacationers that come to visit this beautiful, rich in culture and history historical Tri-State of our nation's Capital...Now for reading maps and Street pole postings of bus stop, this needs a revamp aswell.  the majority of bus stop poles that indicate the bus number need to also indicate the direction in which one is traveling when you get to the bus stop. one is not sure if it's across the street or in the same direction to continue traveling to the Final Destination. most bus drivers when you ask them of a specific stop on their route they don't know, in most cases they just go by landmarks and  in extreme cases they're very rude and ask you if you know how to read . They say to read the labeled at the front of the bus or they'll just look you up and down and wont say a word to you.Just a little frustrated.

42,1.5 star rating,,"Don't get me wrong - I love the DC Metro system. It goes to lots of places (and misses tons of places, too). It's cheap enough with a $14 day pass. There are a few cities I've visited where you can walk out of the airport and immediately get on a subway train to downtown - Minneapolis, London, Atlanta, Chicago. And there are several world class cities that do NOT have a subway system hooked right up to their airport - New York and Montreal for instance.It's great because it will get you pretty close to nearly all of the major tourist destinations with a few exceptions. The Lincoln Memorial is probably the furthest.The Metro stations I've experienced have usually been quite clean with very little trash or litter and I don't recall seeing any real graffiti indoors. The trains as well are clean and reasonably comfortable and they're surprisingly quiet (compared to New York and London!). And it's cool that the same trains are used on all lines throughout the system.Strangely, the start of operations on weekends is SEVEN AM. That's just crazy! And really irritating for someone who had an 8AM departure out of DCA. Ugh."

Metro is more of a negative rating experience and has been for a long time with no improvement in sight! Why I continue to to use it shows the general problem...no options.  Guaranteed money leaves them without any motivation to change.Today's particular issue...signals issues at Roslyn. Multiple minor delays to get to the station which would typically be great luck for metro but of course you get into Roslyn just time to see the doors on the next train you need shut. Oh, and the train going in your direction 20 minutes later! Why the hell wouldn't they delay that train 30 seconds to let people on the train arriving board it knowing the delays. They just don't care about the riders. But more importantly why is the next train 20 minutes?The bottom line if you need to be somewhere metro is not a smart option unless you have all day to get there and you best be praying."

It is no longer reliable, and safety is a major concern.  I've been late for work at least once a week since 2015 started due to WMATA's incompetence."
52,2 star rating,"Jan 2, 2019","Since my '17 review, a lot on Metro has improved. Better headway adherence, automatic door openings, a vow to restore ATC this year, less fires and a higher MDBF. The last one can be attributed to the least reliable railcars being retired. The 7000s now make less noise because of a modification to the trucks--they weren't built to spec. Most problems are from the 7000s having manufacturing and design issues, but as of now, they are doing very well, beating out the 6Ks to the top. They will get rid of the 2 and 3Ks, which will probably bring up reliability, though I personally don't like the 7Ks or the 8K render. The 2/3Ks are the best in the system. Comfy seats, laid back lighting and big windows. 6Ks are similar. This won't hurt my star rating, though."

It might be, at times nicer then the NYCT Subway, but at it's core with things like service it is clear that the NYCT Subway is better. The NYCT Subway may have de-railed 2 times in a month, but they haven't killed anyone in recent years. (Unlike WMATA Metrorail who has killed 9 riders since 2009, 1 worker who could not have prevented the 2009 crash, due to WMATAs lack of safety culture, including falsified logs that led to the death of a rider in 2015). Also, keep an eye out for WMATA hot cars and bad areas, as both can be deadly."

I hate the WMATA. They are useless and a waste of money and their customer service is the absolute worst I have ever dealt with. I had never been so angry at a public transit system.

60,1 star rating,"May 10, 2015","The convenience of traveling around the D.C. area on the WMATA Metro train is greatly outweighed by the constant delays and regular fare increases. I began writing this review yesterday as we were waiting for nearly 15 minutes at Braddock Road without an announcement for why we were just sitting there so long with the doors open. I am finishing this review currently sitting on a train at King Street (about 10 minutes now); but they have at least been polite enough today to announce that the delay is currently caused by single-tracking due to maintenance. Yesterday we left the train and just grabbed a cab to get into the city. I will still use WMATA because it is still the easiest way to get into D.C. I will always dread having to use it,  because it is a headache 9 times or of 10. It doesn't appear that the situation will get better any time soon, as we are always hearing about budget and management issues. All I can say is GOOD LUCK to all riders of the Metro!"

65,1 star rating,"Feb 15, 2017","I never thought I'd rate the metro, but here I am.Honest to God, this is one of the least efficient, most expensive, and overall worst public transportation systems I have witnessed. Growing up I've had the chance to use the Moscow metro (amazing), Paris (alright), Vienna, Prague, Munich, Berlin, and a few domestically like Chicago, Boston, and New York (amazing). WMATA very unfortunately pales in comparison with all of them. There are some pluses to it, but the negatives outweigh it for the most part.Cons:-Bus schedules are inaccurate and oftentimes late, and sometimes don't even come at all for no announced reason-Long wait times outside of rush hour (and decently long during rush hour occasionally too)-Very expensive fare structure (dependent on whether it is rush hour or not [which are very long periods], and the distance of the trip that you're taking)-Occasionally rude employees (I personally haven't had a problem with this)-Severe lack of competent management-Inefficient ownership/operation structure (different counties in 3 different states each have influence over the system, as well as influence form the federal government)-Boring architecture. Despite what the rest of America thinks, I don't like the brutalist concrete. Makes it look Soviet, which is ironic when you look at how the Moscow metro looks-No reliable access to the main international airport (Dulles). This is unheard of for a major city, and frankly embarrassing-Numerous safety issues (outdated technology, somewhat frequent malfunctions and occasional crashes, other major disruptions like safetrack)-Lack of dedicated funding-Confusing fare passes (28 day metro pass?)-Closing at midnight everyday for the foreseeable futurePros:-SmartTrip card paperless payment system-Somewhat convenient locations-Decent bus routes (D6 particularly great imo)-That's really about it honestlyOverall, despite being the second-busiest public transportation system in the country, WMATA is very poorly equipped to handle such a large flow of people consistently and efficiently. The safety issues are particularly pressing for the time being, but I think that the management and funding issues are overarching and will have to be addressed sooner rather than later so that going forward WMATA can be more beneficial and run smoothly."
66,1 star rating,"Mar 23, 2017","I have been taking the bus every day to and from work for over a year and let me tell you, it is the worst. Sometimes buses that aren't full will pass you by for seemingly no reason, which is infuriating. The bus I take to work is so poorly timed. It is supposed to come every 8 minutes. Instead, I see two buses right behind each other pull up almost every morning (of course I'm still two blocks away at this point and can't get there in time to catch it. I swear it's just like that episode of SpongeBob where they left bikini bottom and the bus would sneak past every time they werent looking). This double bus situation means that there won't be another bus for 16-20 minutes. I have sent wmata emails before but of course that was fruitless. I never expected anything else. With Uber and Lyft these days, it's also sometimes easier and cheaper to pool rather than really on this piece of garbage DC calls a Transit system. It's no wonder they are losing money. It's nothing short of what they deserve.Original post: passed by a bus 3/23/17Update: I think I'm just going to start keeping a running tally here of every time a bus passes me by accompanied by the date. 4/4/1710/2 bus was not full and it did not stop even after I waved my arms vigorously.

70,3 star rating,"Jun 10, 2014","Summary: it gets you where You need to go and is better than driving during rush hour, but can be lengthy wait times in evenings and with transfers. The DC metro system has it's ups and downs. And I'm not talking about the huge escalator heights at DuPont Circle or Bethesda. It's nice during rush hour for those of us not going on the most common and sardine'ed routes, and it will pick you up directly from DCA airport which is great. The problem is when it doesn't work, has major delays, and ""routine track work"". If they are going to close the subway of a major metropolitan area in the evenings, at 12am - 5 am Sun-Thursday, I would hope they could use some of this time to fix the issues. A few general statistics-trains are clean-prices are overpriced for public transportation-the trains are packed and run often during rush hour-trains have fairly comfortable seating-pretty good station proximities within dc proper-90% of the time comfortable tempatures-and oh hell, I hate when you miss a 9pm train by 15 seconds and have to wait 20-30 for the next one I'll keep riding, but there is a lot of room for improvement. They could start by hiring competent drivers that don't close the doors on patrons and know how to properly use the one thing they should be trained to use (brakes)."

Today I used the RIBS bus to go to the Whiele Metro Station to go to DC. No problem with the RIBS bus except for the arrival at the Whiele Metro Station.  Two years after the station opened the RIBS bus stop indicator sign had no knowledge that the Metro Station existed.Tried to use the WMATA trip planner.  Before I left my house it showed that I would have to wait for the train till 2:20.  At the the Whiele Station there was no.informstiom whatsoever about trains departing.  When I tried the internet connection to get the information I got a message that the information was not available.I uploaded $20 to my senior smart card and tried to go through a gate.  No luck, it would not open.  Went to the attendant in the booth who said on a gruff voice: ""Did you try the gate at the end!"".  It would never have occurred to me that I had to use s special gate.  Metro did not hint at any entrance restrictions.The public address system at the station was unintelligible.  Just knew they were having some kind  of a problem somewhereA train arrived at the platform at 1:59 PM started to leave the station, stopped and then backed into the station again.  The delay was about 5 minutes.The car on this new line was archaic.  No signs to indicate stops. The windows were so dirty it was very difficult to read the station names when we stopped.  The loudspeaker system and the train operator who had  no idea of how to talk on a public address system made the announcements  totally incomprehensibleAt the Metro Center station I missed the first Red Line train due to very confusing signs.The Red Line car was modern and had station indicating signs but naturally, they did not work.  At least the speaker system and the announcer were comprehensible.Why does the old part of the system have train departures clearly  and accurately shown while the brand new spanking Whiele Ststion doesn't?I pay the tolls to support Metro.  After this trip I will stop using 267.  I see my money is being wasted.I don't think money is the whole problem  I think it's the work culture of the management and employees that has created the current condition.We have the worst  Metro system I have ever used.  And I have used the systems in Hong Kong, Shanghai, Singapore, Paris. London, Chicago, New York and San Francisco.We should be ashamed that we have absolutely the worst system in the world!"

78,1 star rating,"Jul 17, 2016","Oh, WMATA, you've done it again. First, I attempted to use my SmarTrip card to head to the Nats game yesterday. My card, which had approximately $40 on it, mysteriously has a zero balance. After some research, this is apparently the result of WMATA ""archiving"" balances. The trend I saw in the reports is that you have to put more money on the card to ""retrieve"" your archived balance. This equates to both a ransom and fraud. I've scoured your T&Cs for the SmarTrip card and this is not mentioned. Second, the ""station manager"" was of absolutely zero help to me.  The ""manager"" in question was C Jackson of the Suitland station.  When I went to her for help, she was ""busy"" wiping off her desk.  She made zero eye contact and responded to me without even turning on her microphone so I could hear her.  Eventually, and fed up with the extreme disrespect, went back to attempt to just purchase another card since C Jackson was reluctant to do her job.  I'm sure this will not be a surprise to you...it wasn't to me -- BOTH farecard machines were out of order. When I went back to C Jackson, she didn't even bother to look up or respond to my plea for assistance. I left the station and headed to CVS to purchase a new card. There I was greeted warmly, assisted by the operations manager, purchased a new card and was in/out in less than 5 minutes total, including time spent in line. THAT is the type of person you need to hire as a station manager!To make matters worse, when I returned to the station to continue my trip, now late, I spotted two African American women having the exact issue I experienced.  I only mention race and gender for one reason...C Jackson saw, from her little booth, that they were experiencing issues and she promptly exited her booth and approached in an incredibly friendly tone and manner to assist. Here is my query:  Why did I not get the same respect and service?  Is it because I am a man?  Is it because I am white?  Is it because C Jackson is the wrong person for the station manager role?  My best guess is that it is a disgraceful combination of all of these reasons.This, WMATA, is yet another reason your ridership has declined. I've lived in the DC area all my life and have been a patron for many years. The service, both personal and mechanical, has severely declined over the last 10 years. I would also be curious to find out exactly where the monies that I am sure were budget line items every year for maintenance went?  It clearly did not go for maintenance, or the system would not be in this current situation causing a loss of more ridership.  I now have a new SmarTrip card, but have not recovered the existing monies WMATA has stolen from me...and there are countless others in the same boat.#UnsuckMetro"

She took my info, put me on hold for maybe half a minute, and then told me she made the transfer.What a pleasurable experience!"

It is the most beautiful and intelligent lady I spoke with this morning operating the often times uncomfortable and smelly and disgusting P6 headed to Rhode Island Ave. Let me begin with an apology to this Queen of the Nile in not being more greeting in the last two occasions I have riden with her. I'm sorry. I first noticed her professionalism and grace as she asked a gentleman in a wheelchair his destination. I then noticed how neat and together and prepared she was ready to begin the journey to Northeast DC. We came near to my deatination and I had to ask how long she had been employed with the company. I was absolitely shocked when she replied, ""Thirteen-years."" After a brief conversation, I told her this job is not for her. She is intelligent, beautiful, tall, and professional. I, being divorced, at that moment with her yearned for such a beautiful human being. WMATA sucks but this drop dead gorgeous and intelligent lady is a shining example of a virtuous woman. I cannot speak highly enough of HER. She indeed has a name but for now I will refer to her as the most beautiful lady I have ever met in my ENTIRE LIFE."

97,1 star rating,"Aug 30, 2015",I don't have enough bad things to say about wmata. It seems like every single day there is another issue that takes over a month to get fixed. It's ridiculous! More times than not i have waited on a train bc of a maintenance issue or a train is down what have you. Why is the red line single tracking every single weekend?!? Especially on days where there are sports games this is absolutely absurd. Metro needs to figure out a plan to improve this without raising the prices ASAP
98,3 star rating,"Nov 7, 2013","I would say that they have a lot of work to do. I take the metro everyday to work and there are random delays and track work. This morning it took me 1.5 hours to get to work and it normally takes me 20 minutes. In addition, traveling on the weekend can be so unreliable and slow. It takes forever to get anywhere because of all the trackwork. I understand that they are trying to make it better, but it is taking forever."
99,1 star rating,"May 28, 2016","Unreliable schedule, ""angry"" drivers, poor vehicles conditions.It's usual for the bus to be 5-10 minutes, even 15 mins late--or early! Now, I have thought about traffic as excuse, or other reasons about the wmata itself, but...if I were to tell a bus driver to sit at a stop and wait for me for even 2 mins, would they? So why is it acceptable for customers to wait even 10 mins? Or to come to their stops within reasonable time frame only to find that the bus came way too early? Not only this, but sometimes, bus drivers leave stops in a matter of seconds. There are certain stops, I don't know how to call them, where the buses are generally on ""stand-by"" for about 5 mins, but you have some drivers that take off in matters of second. This is not acceptable!Finally, the A/C and heating system is horrible. The air is always dusty, insanely dry--I come back home feeling sick everyday, since I have to take the transit daily. I'm so fortunately because since the temperatures out are not too wild, the a/c is off. But when it will get too hot, I will have to stay in most days. God, I can't even think about the fall or winter, when the BLAST the central heating. Oh, did I mention the musty smells!?I wonder if they care about customers at all."

107,5 star rating,"Jan 17, 2020","I was pleasantly surprised to receive an email from WMATA's Lost & Found department.  I forgot a package on the train (USPS box), the contents worth almost $400.  I figured it was gone; either tossed in the trash or some other result.  This was a great surprise and I have to commend whoever was involved with getting my lost item to the lost & Found.  I filled out the Lost & Found form on the website.  After a few days I didn't hear anything.  I figured it was gone.  After 8 day's I received an email informing me my item was at the Lost & Found office.  I'm not sure of the whole story.  However, I would like to Thank WMATA.  The great people working at this organization made a rider a staunch advocate of the system going forward.   I would also like to include kudos to the Metro Police officers who have gone above and beyond in investigating a mysterious person harassing a female person in my family  during her morning commute.  This harassment happened a few times by the same individual.  I advised her to bring it to the attention of an officer located at the station.  This particular officer assured her that he would show up each day at the specific time she gets on the train to watch.  I am not sure of the result but I do know she did not get harassed anymore."

109,2 star rating,"Aug 7, 2014","The continued degradation of the blue line over the past three years has been appalling. First came the switch from a one to one blue to orange train rotation to a 2 - 3 orange for every blue rotation.  Not only did this add at least 5 - 10 min each trip plus a fare hike, but the 2nd, and more so the 3rd, orange line trains are practically empty as everyone crowds into the first. Then came the yellow line ""rush plus."" Downed trains, track rotation problems and properly identifying each train as either blue or yellow has continued to plague wmata and they hit us with another fare hike and added an additional couple of minutes each way for each trip. Now we have the silver line, which arrived with a fare increase and an additional 10 - 20 minutes for each trip. For example, two evenings ago during rush hour, I waited 10 minutes for a blue at the Metro Center while 3 oranges and 2 silvers passed.  This morning during rush hour waiting at King String noted a 20 minute wait for a blue line. The only reason this is not a one star is that at least the trains are pretty much clean and rarely are without A/C or heating.  No clue why the blue line has been so abandoned with no other commuter solutions offered, especially for tourists (Arlington Cemetery) and travelers (Reagan National). Very disappointed in wmata."

Most days, the trains are efficient, frequent, and on-time. There is always space on the train, unless there is some systematic problem, which is rare.I use the Silver Line, which is great. The new stations are beautiful and clean and accessible. I work near Farragut West, which is perfectly nice.It seems that only people who hate the metro have the impetus to write a review on Yelp, but the metro is great."

112,2 star rating,"Jan 19, 2016","I find it odd that a city that built a public rail still finds more ways to muck it up. I fail to believe that DC cannot come up with a system when every major city in Europe and in Japan operate more reliably and more consistently on a schedule, that it shames DC Metro by comparison. Even in the newer stations, WMATA fails to make the third rail, to bypass any trains that have broken down. The newer trains are nice, but far fewer than the trains that one consistently prays will hold together.This is strictly perpetual poor management. Even in the changes in the leadership, who promise communication, we get met with unannounced delays on the Blue lines, which leads to overcrowding on the Blue lines (moreso than usual). And the bus routes are best to plan with dice, than follow any sort of schedule printed on the kiosks. I've found even the Next Bus app to be wrong in when buses are to arrive, how far they are away, ect. To be frank, WMATA needs an almost complete overhaul.The daily workers on the ground, the labor force, are the only reason for the 2 stars, as they have to deal with the unrelenting complaints by the riders who have no alternative (due to parking being too high of a cost in DC), and being blamed for poor equipment and poor management. They do their best, but the suits up top? There is a rotten state in this WMATA, to match the smell of those brake fluid leaks in stations."
113,1 star rating,"May 1, 2014","Using the metro is not unlike owning and caring for a gremlin, the eponymous creatures from the 1984 classic, ""Gremlins"". Beneath its aesthetically pleasing exterior (due to the system's relative cleanliness over other mass transit systems) lie a set of inconveniences that are frustrating at best and truly capture the film's comedy and horror at its worst.1) NEVER EXPOSE TO SUNLIGHT: In the film's climax, Gizmo, Billy's original mogwai, is able to eliminate the renegade gremlins by opening a set of blinds and exposing them to sunlight. It seems Metro trains have the same allergy to sunlight, as you'll frequently be trapped underground in an effort to hide from the sun's harsh UV rays. I have been trapped in the cavernous tunnels of the rail system so many times, that I've often wondered if I'll ever see sunlight again. As my daily commute keeps me within D.C. city limits, and I unable to confirm what happens at Metro's numerous outdoor stations outside of the city, but I can only assume that trains instantaneously combust when approaching stations such as Arlington Cemetery. 2) NEVER GET IT WET: When it rains in our nation's capital, as it has the majority of this past week, service grinds to a halt, resulting in 15 minute delays during rush hour and single-tracking due to train/rail malfunctions. Unlike gremlins, however, trains do not multiply when exposed to moisture, a defect that would actually improve service. It's unclear why God would design a creature that has such negative side-effects when exposed to water, one of the building blocks of life, but it is equally appalling that someone would design a system that is unable to account for rail problems, lacks an express service, and has stations that are so horribly designed, that you wonder if the designer has a grudge against humanity, similar to Stripe, the main villain of ""Gremlins"".3) NEVER FEED IT AFTER MIDNIGHT: To be fair, WMATA does a good job in discouraging riders from breaking this rule. As service at most stations terminate at midnight during the work week, there is not much opportunity to feed the beast that is WMATA your money, though service is extended on weekends. Luckily, the infrequent trains and unreliability of service often deters would-be riders from using the Metro late at night on the weekends. Smarter commuters opt for better options such as Uber  and other taxi services, while only the bravest (read: drunkest) travelers dare to tempt fate by breaking this cardinal rule.While I enjoy the whimsy of ""Gremlins"" as a motion picture, the real world manifestation of gremlins (that is, WMATA) does not capture the film's action and humor, instead replacing those qualities with crippling despair. LIke caring for your own mogwai, riding the Metro means you are subjecting yourself to a world of inconveniences that is both expensive and burdensome. Do not be persuaded by other yelp reviews that champion individual standout performances of lone WMATA employees or praise WMATA""s ease for tourists; those people just haven't seen ""Gremlins""."

Metro trains are stop-and-go. 15 minute waits for your train at rush hour. Filthy trains. Inaccurate platform information. Balky entrance/exit gates.  The list goes on. The cities of first world countries seem to know how to do this. Of course it's political. I guess transportation subsidy is socialist.
115,1 star rating,"Jan 13, 2015","The DC metro is a privatized bussiness. I think this is the basic problem, some one at the top of this transit system is making lots of cash and doesnt have any incentive to keep it up to date. In a government centered city we should have access to a tranist system that isnt run by the private sector. Its dangerous, hostile and very expensive. Its at capacity, needs allot of renovation and updating. Its not normal to feel like the system you use to get to work isnt safe and is this costly. There should be ways to modernize it and make it safer.I just want to update my review......now the Metro is not safe to ride, it is routinely breaking down and filling with electrical smoke. I think cost is no longer the main concern its heath and maybe potential chronic breathing problems."

So this is just a short review for the metrobus:I guess to me, distances I consider short are long to others because I walk a lot. I mean, I always wonder why there are so many stops in DC for the metrobus but I guess people in the states do not like to walk. But when I go on the 30 buses or N bus, E buses or some of the L buses, they have stops every 1-2 blocks and I always wonder why that can't be at least every 3-4 blocks or more. But sometimes I go to a stop and, even with my fairly poor vision, I can look down the street and see the next stop. Has metro ever thought of increasing the distance between each stop?  Because with some of these buses, it takes forever and a day to get to your destination. I figure you are stopping, on average, every half block almost. Either because of a red light, or a bus stop or to swerve around a police car or delivery truck. To me it is wildly inefficient. Plus, if you are at a terminus waiting for a bus to come out, sometimes they not leave in time.  Sometimes because a driver is fooling around but I guess there are other reasons too.  Not consistent enough departures to depend upon as this type of stuff can make you late.I would only depend on metrobus if you don't need to be anywhere ASAP, there is decent service (leaves every 20 minutes), you have a nextbus app and you are leaving from somewhere that is not close to a metro and is going somewhere that is also not close to a metro and the route is at least somewhat direct.  Otherwise, you are better off taking metro rail.  Drivers are hit or miss but some of them can be rude:  They rush people on and off just because they are running late on their route (why did you dick around so much before departing?), they DO NOT know their route well enough sometimes to give you proper advice on your desired destination, etc.  Other times, I have come across some lovely drivers.

I have not taken a bus since 1996! Mr . Caster not only greeted me courteously and reassured me to get safely to my destination. Mr. Caster acknowledged each and every bus rider. Answered numerous questions while boarding and alerted all passengers how many minutes to departure time. Once Mr. Caster began his route, he treated each passenger with respect and care as he would find the safest area for each passenger to get off the bus. He would lower the bus and said goodbye to each passenger. One passenger for instance mentioned to him that she was going to Plaza del Mercado, Mr. Caster suggested to her a different stop where would be safer for her to walk. The area had been covered with at least 10 inches of snow and many sidewalks were covered. People walked along the main road and Mr. Caster would bring each passenger to the safest area each time. I was impressed by his dedication and care as he went above and beyond his duties. The passenger who was going to Plaza del Mercado got off safely and he even said to her to be careful and to watch for vehicles. That passenger seemed she had a disability and Mr. Caster treated her as he did each and every passenger, male and female, always looking out for their safety. I asked Mr. Caster for his name, his humility was such that he said it was not necessary for me to write a note that mentioning to him was enough. Mr. Caster made me feel safe, dropped me off at a safe location and conducted many acts of kindness throughout his route. I hope this note reaches Mr. Caster, he is an asset to our transportation system in Montgomery County.My kindest regards"
121,2 star rating,"Oct 14, 2011","Their rating should be somewhere between two and three stars. While metro is definitely clean, well organized and relatively easy to understand in DC it leaves a lot to be desired. Escalators never work, customer service is lacking, trains are often sharing tracks and experiencing lots of delays, and if you are commuting during rush hour plan to feel like you are in a can of sardines. Compared to many other metropolitan areas though metro in DC really isn't THAT bad."
122,1 star rating,"Jun 26, 2019","I haven't used the bus system, but as far as the train goes, I would avoid at all costs. There are no positives I can think of. During rush hour, trains should come every 3-5 minutes to accommodate the number of people riding at that time, especially in the middle of the city. Instead, the greenline trains that goes straight up through the city come every 7-9 minutes during rush hour. Twice in the last month I, along with a lot of other people, couldn't get on the train because it was so full, and the next one wasn't going to get there for another 8 minutes. You don't have that problem during the off hours, but just be prepared to stand on the platform for a while because the trains only come every 15-20 minutes. This is all assuming there aren't any delays due the track work that is somehow ALWAYS happening. I think $2 is expensive for the poor service you get, and that's the cheapest your ride will be. It could get up to almost $3 for one ride. Not very clean. Platforms are dark and dingy with mice scurrying around. Overall just not a good experience."
123,2 star rating,"Jul 3, 2012","Metro Train 1 star.  Metro Bus 3 StarNative Washingtonians who have never left the area are often not aware that the best trains have 2 routes - a local and express.  You get every route on WMATA trains as local.  This mean even if a person is going to the other end of the line, that person must endure every stop along the line! I must state some good things before I get into why I've observed why the Metro trains are so bad.The trains are clean.  No one is allowed to eat or drink (unless during a heatwave and restrictions are lifted for a bottle of water) on the train.  The escalators are under constant repair.  So riders don't see an abundance of rats on the tracks.My issue with the WMATA trains is the three C's:1. Cost2. Lack of Convenience3. Lack of CharacterWMATA trains charge for  both distance traveled AND time of day one travels.Riding from the start of the line to the end is expensive.  In addition, the service for riding weekdays during the rush hour is called the peak of the peak and extra charge is placed on that too.  Paying $12 one way is normal for DC.  Also, keep in mind that Federal Government workers have Metro Checks which pay for their rides.  The people who can most afford Metro get free rides into work while others must pick up the exorbitant costs.Secondly, lack of convenience is because the buses that did route from the county directly into the city were altered to go to the more costly Metro stations.  Taking the buses used to be cheaper and a bit less time consuming.  Now most bus routes in the county lead toward the Metro stations.  Riding one bus to the next with the transfer cuts costs for the rider.  I suggest checking the WMATA site for possible bus routes.  During the heatwave, in a CODE RED Metro buses are FREE to ride and are air conditioned.Also, I had a meeting in DC when I rushed like Cinderella to catch the train directly across the street at 11:50PM only to find that the last train going to my station left on a Thursday night.  I'd have to take 3 WMATA buses to get back to my car which was parked at a Metro lot!  These buses would take about 3 hours to get me there around 3-3:30AM!!!  DC Metro shuts down at midnight during the week!  This accounts for the lack of quality nightlife in the city.  Other places rely on convenience of public transportation to get riders in and out of town safely.  DC is two-faced in that they want you to visit, but leave when the 11:00 news comes on television.Riding the Metro trains, the stations have little character.  Sure no one is allowed to panhandle which is great, but no one is allowed to entertain at all.  Outside some stations, musicians recently have been allowed to entertain.  However once on the trains, the atmosphere is super conservative and lacks any energy.    Sure I want to get from point A to B at a reasonable cost in a reasonable amount of time, but having something fun around helps me forget that I just paid $5 to get from Union Station to the County and had local stops along the way!  Make sure that if you catch a bus from the train to get a transfer slip when getting onto the WMATA train.  No one will tell you this."

Those cushy driver jobs are given by blacks only to other blacks).http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/mar/27/even-with-big-salaries-metro-cant-fill-its-jobs/?page=all"
128,1 star rating,"Mar 14, 2018",M.barnes at Rockville metro is a rotund cow. How dare you try to deny a paying customer access to the restroom in retaliation for being confronted about waiting time...patiently waiting 2 minutes while you do god knows what in the booth with no other customers are around. Then bark go stand by the door ill be there!! Animal. Miraculously another person came out so i didnt have to wiz my pants dealing with this indignant spiteful person. I don't know why all the women that work for metro are categorically disgusting human beings and metro is only concerned about raising fares shoddy track maintenance weekend parking fare hike and sucking the customers dry... sub par service for 30 years. Theres a handful of decent guys working here but look if you hate actual work and getting up off your lard butt but like the checks get help it doesnt work like that. Im pro union but in this instance accountability is needed these people are allowed to be a joke of an organization much like their federal gubment friends. Sick of them.

Always delayed and takes forever for the train to come. Comparing to the subway system in third world countries they are much better than DC metro. There are no signs inside the rail cars to know what stop is coming up, good luck figuring it out of you are a tourist, they suppose to announce it over the microphone like they use to do in the 19th century, but speakers are either broken or you can't understand what they are saying too. Escalators always broken and majority of the time facilities are always dirty with trash everywhere. The changes are coming in 2017, metro will be getting some new rail cars but that happened after numerous passenger casualties have happened due to poor safety conditions."
