Many workers enjoy the benefits of privacy and the added time of not having to commute, while employers often cite advantages of being on-site even in office jobs. While in-person work has rebounded recently, much like public transit usage, it has not nearly returned to the prevalence of prior to the pandemic. Therefore, understanding trends surrounding remote work can provide insights on how to analyze public transportation trends.\n",

Thus, these datasets will feature Yelp reviews of both the WMATA and BART systems, including the date of review, the exact text, and the associated numerical rating (1-5 stars). Gathering labeled text data will be invaluable for Naive Bayes classification in the future. To accomplish this, I will use the `BeautifulSoup` package in Python, which facilitates web scraping via HTML codes.
