        "## Introduction \n",
        "\n",
        "For this section, we will be applying clustering analyis to both record and text datasets. Starting with the record dataset, our feature data $X$ will be comprised of US Census data gathered by Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS). [^1] This dataset includes many reported variables regarding people, their location, and their household. An important aspect to note about this process is that while this dataset does contain valuable information on each person's mode of transportation to work, which is ultimately the target variable of this analysis, clustering is an unsupervised learning method that is generally done without knowing a target variable or any relationships within the data. Therefore, this data will contain the following features, each of which can be important indicators of one's lifestyle and how they might be impacted by public transit trends and phenomena:\n",
        "\n",
        "- City population (00s): The population of the city in which they reside (missing values or unincorporated cities will be dropped, as the person is less likely to have access to public transit)\n",
        "- Age (years)\n",
        "- Total personal income (dollars)\n",
        "\n",
        "Secondly, clustering is a valuable tool for understanding text data and how language can be analyzed via numerical methods. The feature data for this process will be Yelp reviews for some of the most commonly used public transit systems in the US. Specifically, the top seven public transit systems from the Federal Transit Administration's 2022 Ridership Report. These are:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Metropolitan Transit Authority (New York City) [^2]\n",
        "- Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority [^3]\n",
        "- Chicago Transit Authority [^4]\n",
        "- Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (Philadelphia) [^5]\n",
        "- Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (Boston) [^6]\n",
        "- Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (Washington, D.C.) [^7]\n",
        "- San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District [^8]\n",
        "\n",
        "This data will be clustered based on the review text, then compared against the associated numerical ratings in order to gather insights on how the language that people use can be predictive of their overall sentiment or opinion on public transit."

        "The goal of clustering is to find groups that convey similarity withing the data. This is generally done by assessing some distance metric between data points to determine the likelihood that they would belong in the same cluster. However, this can be done in several different ways. In this analysis, we will be applying K-Means, DBSCAN, and hierarchical clustering to our record data, and just K-Means to our text data. Thus, it is important to understand the similarities and differences between these methods, as well as model selection methods for making sense of the clustering.\n",
        "\n",
        "### K-Means\n",
        "\n",
        "K-Means clustering is, in simplest terms, \"centroid based cluster identification\". To perform this, a user will define number of $k$ clusters to partition $n$ observations into. Each cluster will have a centroid, which is essentially the mean of all of its data points. All observations will be placed in the cluster with the nearest mean to itself, which can be measured using several distance metrics, usually Euclidean distance. In practice, this results in partitions called Voronoi cells, which are tesselated regions around each observation that represent the space occupied by that observation (i.e. the space in which that observation is the closest data point).\n",
        "\n",
        "This method minimizes variances (squared Euclidean distances) within clusters. The algorithm works by first randomly selecting a set of $k$ centroids, which are used to initially place the observations in a cluster. There is then an iterative approach to optimize the location of each centroid until either the centroids stabilize in set locations, or if the iterations hit a user-defined cap. Ultimately, K-means tends to be useful because of its simplicity. While it often struggles with data that has clusters of unusual shpaes due to the circular nature of converging around a centroid, it is often very efficient in grouping data that follows its requirements. [^9]\n",
        "\n",
        "### DBSCAN\n",
        "\n",
        "Density-based spacial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) is a non-parametric algorithm which groups points that are close to one another. This differs from K-means in that instead of searching for nearby centroids, for each observation we are looking for the nearest other observations. In practice, this means that each cluster is a high-density region of data points, while they are each separated by low-density regions of datapoints.\n",
        "\n",
        "The usefulness of this method comes when irregularly-shaped clusters are present in the data. While searching for centroids generally results in spherical clusters, DBSCAN can identify clusters of all shapes and sizes, so long as those shapes represent continuous regions of high density. Additionally, when presented with noise, DBSCAN effectively filters out data points that do not coincide with others. An observation that is far away from any other will not be placed in a high-density cluster; instead, it will be identified as a point that does not have close neighbors, and may be left in its own cluster.\n",
        "\n",
        "The algorithm follows the following steps: [^10]\n",
        "\n",
        "- An observation is arbitrarily picked as the starting points\n",
        "- If the number of observations within a specified distance exceeds a specified minimum number, those points will be considered a cluster\n",
        "- Recursively, this process is done for each point in the cluster to expand the cluster\n",
        "\n",
        "### Hierarchical Clustering\n",
        "\n",
        "While the two methods outlined above are examples of partitional clutering (i.e. they group data into divisions that do not overlap), hierarchical clustering produces nested clusters, in which there can essentially be \"clusters of clusters\". In this case, there is no assumed value of $k$, as the algorithm creates clusters based on the organization of the data. This technique can be broken down into two types: Agglomerative and Divisive.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Agglomerative clustering, each observation represents its own cluster. As observations (and subsequently clusters) are deemed to be similar, pairs of clusters get merged together. This can be thought of as a \"bottom up\" process, as one moves up the hierarchy for this technique.\n",
        "\n",
        "Division is the \"top down\" alternative to this process. In this case, all observations start as one big cluster. Recursively, this cluster is split as observations are deemed dissimilar, until each observation is accounted for in its own cluster. These clusters are often visualized in a dendrogram.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Silhouette Method\n",
        "\n",
        "For this process, we will be using the Silhouette Method to evaluate the quality of clustering for each defined number of clusters. This process iterates over each data point and measures the extent to which that observation is more similar to its own cluster than other clusters. A score closer to 1 suggests well-separated clusters, meaning the observations are significantly more similar to their own cluster than to other clusters. Conversely, a score close to -1 suggests that points are closer to other clusters than their own, which denotes poor clustering. A score around 0 indicates that clusters overlap. The purpose of calculating this for each specified $k$ is to allow us to choose the optimal number of clusters. The $k$ that returns the highest silhouette score will allow us to have better-defined clusters."

The curse of the<br>tunnels? Fix it. Damn it. Half of discretionary income of<br>all stupid people with no income goes to cellphone bills and<br>does not work when there is nothing to do and want to use<br>it! The tunnel is good however.

Then when one finally showed up, the<br>driver had no idea why the others were no shows. How can<br>they not be aware of what is going on, on the routes they<br>drive??? It was more tolerable during warm weather but how<br>do you expect people to wait in the freezing cold like<br>that!?? And what about people who are relying on this bus to<br>get to work?

My only<br>minor complaints or issues:  Cloth seats, just gross, unless<br>you get a newish car, this can;t be a good idea on rainy<br>days when the seats stay wet all day.  Why are there only<br>4-5 stops in downtown?  I know the line wraps through the<br>city but there are so many neighborhoods with no subway<br>access and nothing near Golden Gate Park.

The buses are convenient<br>at times if you can find the right one going in the right<br>direction at the right timeHOWEVER, there are a lot of<br>advantages, it is pretty cheap to ride unlimited and I have<br>to say its extremely easy to understand.. plus it saves the<br>hassle of having to designate a driver for a night out and<br>its WAY cheaper than a cab!  Not all the lines run at all<br>times of the night.Check www.transitchicago.com and go to<br>Trip Planner, its an awesome way to know exactly which bus<br>or train to take for your time and destination!"

Overcrowded trains - if BART<br>knows there's a buncha people that ride this heap during<br>rush hour, they should have more trains or cars but instead,<br>they allow people to cram in like a buncha sardines.2. The<br>fares - it seems like every other year, BART increases fares<br>and for what? Riders don't get more frequent trains or<br>cleaner cars. It also seems like escalators constantly fail.<br>Good luck if you have a sprained ankle. The El Cerrito plaza<br>center raised there parking fare from a $1 in cash to $3 in<br>a year. Also if you don't have cash after you fight someone<br>for a parking spot, God be with you because the machines<br>only accept cash. 3. Delays - I used to ride BART from the<br>east bay to San Francisco every morning for work. Almost<br>always was I delayed. Medical emergencies, train in front of<br>ours, stop and go traveling through the tunnel etc. One day,<br>I left an hour earlier than normal to anticipate a delay and<br>I still managed to come into work 30 minutes late due to a<br>\"medical emergency\". 4. The union - BART employees are the<br>highest public transportation employees in the country. Yet<br>they always want raises and when they don't get them, they<br>shut down BART and most of the Bay Area is a sh!t show<br>during commute hours. Higher ups of BART are too stupid to<br>realize they should hire a buncha temp employees to train<br>them during the negotiation months to operate trains incase<br>this moron union decided to throw another b!tch fit.5. Ride<br>quality - if you've ever ridden BART, I'm sure you'll know<br>it always seems like the damn heater is on or you're in a<br>sauna because it's just really overcrowded. Either way, with<br>increasing fares, you'd figure BART would have money to<br>install AC or some type of temperature control machine in<br>these overcrowded cars. Each train during rush hour commute<br>is a breathing ground for sickness and diseases. The one<br>time I ride BART this week is the time I caught the flu.<br>Thanks BART. 6. The lack of bathrooms - the other day may<br>train took 40 minutes to pick me up and nearly two hours to<br>get me home. If you ever need to take a piss due to a<br>\"medical emergency\" or any other BS delay, do it before you<br>ride this heap. There aren't any bathrooms in most of the<br>stations."

There's something about the public transit in<br>another city that just screams \"ADVENTURE!\"  (Okay, maybe<br>it's more of a mild shriek).As I walked towards the hotel<br>shuttles and cabs, I kept seeing signs for \"BART\". Being<br>that it was my first trip to SF, I had no clue what a BART<br>was. Honestly, all I could think of was The Simpsons. The<br>more sensical part of my brain kept telling me what a<br>ludicrous connection this was. I'm glad I've learned to<br>listen to it.Turns out BART is the Bay Area Rapid Transit<br>system. Walking upto the platform, I read the instructions<br>on how to buy my ticket. Back in Calgary, we have a flat<br>fair to ride. It'll cost you $2.75 CDN to go from one end of<br>the city to the other. Here in SF, it's a different price<br>for each stop. The fares were listed on a printout taped up<br>inside of a page protector next to the electronic ticket<br>booths. My one way ride was $8.10. I'm not going to complain<br>about the price of the C-Train in Calgary anymore.Buying my<br>ticket was a bit of an unusual experience as well. After<br>reading the instructions on requiring a different fair<br>depending on the stop I was headed to, I figured I'd be able<br>to pick my stop, stick my money in, grab my ticket and be on<br>my way. It was almost that simple, but not quite. Instead,<br>after looking up the cost of the fair on the print out, I<br>then had to stick my money in the ticketing machine and<br>change the fair to the appropriate amount using buttons that<br>added or subtracted $1 or $0.05 at a time. It was a little<br>strange. What happens if you don't put in enough money for<br>the stop you're going to? I'm not sure, and I decided I<br>didn't want to find out.Next step, getting on the train.<br>Calgary trains have a button to press to make the doors<br>open. BART trains... don't. So how do you make the silly<br>things open? I tried everything. I touched the door, I<br>jumped on the black space on the platform that the train car<br>doors lined up with (in case it was some new fandangled<br>space age San Fran train that was weight triggered or<br>something). I even waved my arms up and down in front of the<br>door on the off chance that a motion sensor would open the<br>doors. Nothing. Those doors didn't budge. A gentleman behind<br>me tried pushing on the doors. Nothing for him either. The<br>train sat there for another couple of moments. I gave up and<br>resigned myself to the fact that perhaps I had missed my<br>chance to get on this one (I had bought my ticket after it<br>pulled up after all). Thirty seconds later, the doors opened<br>on their own. After I got on the train and got myself<br>settled, I opened up the map I had grabbed before buying my<br>ticket. Looking at it now, I figured out where I'd need to<br>get off the train to switch over to another train to get to<br>the right stop for my hotel. See, the train I got on was<br>part of the yellow line. The map showed three other lines,<br>and the stop I wanted resided on the red line. I looked<br>closely at my map and saw four white dots all in a row on<br>each line at Balboa. This must be where all four tracks<br>coincide. I would get off there and switch over to the red<br>track.As we pulled into the Daly City station, the operator<br>made an announcement that anyone wishing to switch trains<br>should do so at this station! What?? But it didn't have any<br>white dots on the map! Maybe that didn't matter? I thought<br>it wiser to listen to him and got off the train. I headed<br>for the exit to go find the platform for the red track. I<br>ended up on the platform on the other side, trains on this<br>side were headed back in the direction I came from.<br>Confused, I retraced my steps down the stairs and happened<br>upon the information desk. \"Excuse me, what train will take<br>me to Powell Station?\" I asked the desk attendant. \"Anyone<br>on that side\" she replied as she pointed to the platform I<br>had been on in the first place. Turns out I had pictured a<br>much bigger and more intricate train system than what<br>existed. Sure there are four lines, but there are only two<br>sets of rails. Go figure.BART, your doors and your map<br>tricked me. But your attendant was helpful, and you provided<br>me with my first experience of San Francisco. Not all cities<br>have the benefit of a train that can take you all the way to<br>the airport for under $10, nor does the acronym for their<br>transit system flow so nicely into a one syllable name.

                      "In the wake of a profound post World War II residential and<br>commercial resettlement, coupled with the consequent<br>elevation in automobile demand, Bay Arians faced an<br>escalating overpopulation of highways and bridges spanning<br>the bay. Thus the BART was born, a system created to deliver<br>the Bay Area to the doorstep of the next generation in<br>public transportation HAAHAHAHA. Wow, really? Did you just<br>read that too? I mean, seriously? Cummmmon!! CUMMMMMMMMON!!!<br>Oh well, back to my point. In today's world, the trend<br>towards highly selective career placement is skyrocketing<br>and companies are forced to draw resources from a wider<br>array of loosely connected cities at all Cardinal points of<br>the Bay Area. In addition, corporatization is replacing the<br>Mom and Pop shops with high rise economic giants and<br>industrial machines staffing millions of \"blue\" and \"white\"<br>collar workers as well as specialized labor in areas where<br>residential limitations restrict the amount of local hiring<br>available. The non feasible solution: double the number of<br>Bay Area bridges from 6 to 12. The more practical solution:<br>expand the Public Transportation system. The Problem: career<br>opportunities have expanded, the population has expanded,<br>technology has expanded, the movement towards a leaner,<br>greener, less carbon, more enviro-friendly society has<br>expanded, but the BART....it hasn't expanded and it is now<br>itself a victim of overpopulation. Unfortunately, I am a<br>number in the system, a sprocket in the machine, a working<br>American plagued by the dilemma of fluctuating gas prices<br>and the possibly devastating effects of green house gasses<br>on the future of our planet.....well the BART actually zips<br>me over traffic and cuts off an hour from my commute home<br>but I do care about the environment too. Though each BART<br>car has its own personality, its own sounds, squeaks,<br>rattles, jars, pungent aromas and creepy BART engineers<br>announcing over the speakers, \"Maaaaaaaac Arthur Station,<br>our nnnnnnnext stop is Maaaaaac Arthur Station, your final<br>traaaaaaansfer point for Freemont bound passengers,\" in a<br>very Charles Manson-ish voice; there is one similar aspect<br>of every BART car that I have come to accept,<br>overpopulation. Every day, millions of numbers, millions of<br>sprockets pile onto the BART telling themselves that they<br>are getting to work while simultaneously saving the<br>environment, assuring that little Billy has green trees to<br>climb when he grows up, but in actuality, they're simply<br>making an effort to save a little gas money and avoid the<br>devastating consumption of the highway system by automobiles<br>and there blaring horns. This overpopulation of the BART<br>system, in essence, creates individual cities within each<br>car. Excessive amounts of people with multiple occupations,<br>cultures and religions pile into an area which,<br>geographically, is ten times too small. BART personalities<br>run rampant: the lotion salesman who sells Dixie cups full<br>of lotion which he pours from a large container with no<br>visible seal guaranteeing you that it was purchased and not<br>made, the struggling musician that paces the overcrowded<br>isles playing guitar gibberish, begging for money and<br>sharing his lifelong story, the bums who only contribute to<br>the already visible aroma and try to pawn stolen BART<br>tickets, and the crazies who yell and scream about things<br>that only themselves in their insanity can understand.<br>Hormones elevate as the competition to attain the best seat,<br>or \"a\" seat plays out, or the elderly and handicapped try to<br>capitalize on their federally assigned seats, and<br>involuntary exchanges of bodily secretions due to the close<br>proximity of fellow passengers occurs. With each stop, more<br>and more sprockets board the vessel shoving you closer and<br>closer to the person behind you, into that small area of<br>space surrounding a human being where you can actually feel<br>their emission of body heat and warm moist expulsions of<br>breath trickling over your skin. The BART has its own set of<br>cultural standards as well. In everyday life, we know our<br>personal boundaries and those of others because they have<br>been engrained into our very existence since our birth. On<br>the BART, different rules apply. Phrases like, \"excuse me,\"<br>or \"Thanks for that taste of arm pit,\" or \"watch where<br>you're sticking that thing,\" are replaced with grunts,<br>groans and tolerant sighs because intolerance is not<br>accepted on rapid transit. The air becomes so thick that you<br>can feel its texture. The only thing that is stopping you<br>from reaching up and grabbing a handful of it is the fear of<br>what you will actually grab, and not having a place to wipe<br>your hand off afterwards. AAAAAUUUUGGGGH!!! DEATH!!!  So as<br>I am gliding over the freeway on an elevated track with my<br>face smashed up against the glass window and three different<br>people breathing down my neck, I sit in envy of the poor<br>bastards stuck in miles of traffic, crawling down the<br>freeway, laying on their horns and cursing the day they were<br>born...I long to feel their misery"

It stimulates the local<br>economy, boosts the immune system, teaches you time<br>management, and has a few valuable safety lessons hiding in<br>the package it presents to the general public. Let me<br>explain how.....I assume the local economy must be getting a<br>boost because every other major city I have been to with a<br>public transit system is less expensive. Maybe the money is<br>going to the high paid officials but I can only assume that<br>they spend money, so hooray for all of us public<br>transportation takers funding their fine dining and luxury<br>goods habits. You clearly have to be building up your immune<br>system when you are exposed to the multitude of germs<br>crusted onto the upholstered seats that have not been<br>cleaned since 1972, when BART first opened.You have to have<br>a good sense of time management to make sure you make the<br>last BART train back to where you came from by midnight.<br>Forget the fact that you will have to leave all of your<br>friends who are still having a good time, this is about<br>responsibility, damnit! Safety lesson #1. If you are<br>standing at a BART station make sure you are very aware of<br>your surroundings, because security is not present most of<br>the time. Safety lesson #2. Learn that if you want to stay<br>out past 11:30 it is important not to drink with your<br>friends. You will need to drive home, an activity best<br>tackled sober.Safety lesson #3. Some people will not adhere<br>to safety lesson #2, so be a very careful driver, lest a<br>drunk person ram you off the road. Yep, thanks BART for<br>really stepping up and being there for us.

Well the problem wasn't that that it was packed,<br>its that it decided to NOT SHOW....THREE red line trains<br>went by before a brown.

I didn't get off  at<br>Monroe/State until almost 9..and then had to walk 10min to<br>work (instead of the around the corner ...if i took the<br>brown)...so here i am, showing up 35min late.

The Dearborn Street<br>subway construction is getting really really old.  Last<br>week, I was stuck on the train at Grand because there was a<br>one track operation at Clark and Lake, because of said<br>construction.  we were at Grand for almost 30 minutes while<br>we had to wait for O'hare bound trains to clear.  That's all<br>well and good, and I, of all people, understand about<br>delays, ect.  But after 30 minutes of sitting there, I<br>REALLY had to \"powder my nose!\"  I walked off of the train<br>and headed to the first car where the train operator was,<br>and asked him how much longer we would be sitting here.  He<br>smiled and politely told me the situation, and that we would<br>be waiting for at least 2 more O'hare trains to pass before<br>we would be able to move.  I asked him if there was any way<br>that I could use the restroom upstairs.  He then tried to<br>find the supervisor to see if I could, but he had just<br>disappeared down the tracks. He told me that I had plenty of<br>time to go and come back and the train would be still<br>sitting at the station.  He then told me to go up and tell<br>the security guy that the conductor said I could use the<br>bathroom at the station.  I thanked him and ran up top.The<br>security guy wouldn't let me use the station bathroom, but<br>he told me what restaurant I could go to and use theirs, and<br>he promised to let me back in when I came back.  Skeptical,<br>but desperate, I followed his advice and off I went.  When I<br>came back, he DID remember me, and let me back down, and the<br>train was STILL sitting there.  I hopped back on the train<br>in my same seat, and not 2 minutes later we FINALLY on our<br>way.Now I am sure the operator was getting bombarded with<br>angry people wanting to know how much longer, long before I<br>asked him myself.  The fact that he calmly, and politely<br>answered my questions and request impressed me.  The fact<br>that the security guy could have been a complete jerk and<br>not let me back down to the train again, but didn't<br>impressed me too.

I have been living in the Bay Area now for just<br>over a year & take BART into San Francisco from Oakland at<br>least thrice a week if not more for work. It is a reliable<br>form of transport to commute into the city from the town. I<br>also love using BART to go into Berkeley & other parts of<br>the Bay Area.

I much prefer<br>BART over the bus systems here as there is something about<br>travel by train that is nice.

Sure it might get crowded at<br>times & you might have to stand yet this is nothing compared<br>to taking the Metro train in New Delhi, India where<br>commuters are packed like Dolmas in a tin.

(Cue Rocky theme song)I<br>found the ticket machines confusing, and I didn't know how<br>to otherwise find out how much to pay/where to get off the<br>train, so I asked the woman working at the information<br>booth. (Conversation with a stranger? Imagine!) She gave me<br>the lowdown in about five seconds, and I was off.

I had couple of<br>friends visit from Europe and were really disgusted how bad<br>and smelly it was compared to their public transit rails in<br>europe.  And they being in U.S and specially san francisco<br>couldn't believe how smelly and bad it was.   The worst<br>thing that happens to the BART is by the homeless and pan<br>handlers who don't shower for months and sit on them.  Oh<br>My!  Couple times I remember getting on BART and then sat<br>down and smelled a stench that was horrible. This time,  I<br>could barely breath.  Then I noticed half the car was empty<br>except for one big filty homless lady at the corner of the<br>empty area and some people on the other corner crowded<br>together.  I was in the middle closer to the empty corner<br>and realized the horrendous rotting smell was coming from<br>the filthy homeless lady 10 seats down!!! And forced all the<br>passengers to crowd together for a breath of fresh air.    I<br>tried to act as if I was sick having a cold and can't smell<br>anything to overcome my embarassment of not figurring this<br>out to begin with and move to a corner or the next crowded<br>car!     I think I was successful for about 3 mins or so and<br>felt like throwing up and bolted into the next car and then<br>the one after that.  WHEW!  Now the really funny , sad and<br>disgusting part is that imagine that person who takes that<br>seat when it's empty and thinking , what in the world is<br>that smell.   Now I only ask to take this example and apply<br>it pretty much to most of the seats in BART.   EWWWWWW!!!!!<br>That was the last time I took BART.   Thankfully as I'm in<br>south bay /peninsula I try to take caltrain if needed.

(Compared to other<br>cities though, getting into, parking, and leaving SF is<br>expensive too).  - Save the Mission and the Market Street<br>Corridor, BART doesn't really go anywhere worth while in SF.<br>A lot of non-San Franciscans and even locals don't like Muni<br>so they don't go places BART doesn't go.  SF and the region<br>as a whole would benefit from a line underneath Geary Blvd,<br>and if a Geary line ever got built, then a Park<br>Presidio/19th Ave line to Daly City creating a loop should<br>be next.  (If only!)

DC with a similarly<br>aged and built system does it.- It's not very intuitive.<br>Thank god I started riding BART and Muni with the help of<br>locals, otherwise I would have never figured it out.  Okay,<br>that's my two cents.  I'd better stop now, otherwise I won't<br>stop."

Here are<br>some simple tips. Feel free to share:- hustle when the<br>train/bus pulls in, don't amble over like you're getting<br>popcorn during commercial break- when you board the train,<br>KEEP MOVING IN as far as possible; don't stop to take in the<br>view- if you're by the door, step off to let others out;<br>this eliminates the irrational fear of riders getting stuck<br>in the car and missing a stop and, therefore, the<br>unwillingness to move towards the centre of the car in the<br>first place- if you're waiting to board, wait till others<br>have exited; only salmon should work so hard against an<br>oncoming deluge- your groceries, backpack, laptops and<br>miscellaneous bullshit didn't pay a fare so they are not<br>entitled to their own seat- SIT DOWN if there's an empty<br>seat so others can move in; you're not a hero for standing<br>that extra stop or two- resist the urge to chat with the bus<br>driver and MOVE DOWN THE BUS- exit buses at the rear<br>whenever possible so you don't impede rapid boarding at the<br>ENTRANCE; there are stickers and announcements requesting<br>you do this so there's no excuse for you not to do so,<br>unless you're deaf and blind as well as stupid- speak up if<br>you witness dumbassedness; crying into your Pinot Grigio<br>after the fact helps absolutely no one- keep your boring<br>cellphone/live conversations to yourselves, and turn your<br>cheesy music down (well, none of these disrupts service but<br>I just want to point out that you're neither interesting,<br>special nor important)I used to get frustrated at the CTA<br>for their seeming incompetence, but when I really thought<br>hard about it, a large part of the problem fell squarely on<br>the empty heads of many who use the system. You can throw<br>all the money and planning you want into the CTA and they<br>will still fail if people insist on working against them.<br>There's no way the CTA can overcome millions of lazy,<br>ignorant dumbasses coming at them each day. Simply<br>none.Don't even try comparing the CTA to mass transit<br>systems in other cities. Well, if you do, first use them and<br>take note of how much more civic-minded their riders are.<br>Even in New York, whose residents are much maligned for<br>being 'assholes', you will note that people generally<br>approach public transit as a PUBLIC SERVICE, meaning no one<br>gets special treatment unless they actually need it. No one<br>on the MTA will put up with any of the shit that happens on<br>the CTA. If that makes them assholes, it also makes you a<br>dumbass crybaby.No doubt, the system is far from perfect. I<br>think we all know that. But if we truly want the CTA to<br>improve and succeed, we have to do our part. Yes, whining to<br>your friends is easier and probably more fun, but it doesn't<br>get the job done.One more thing: KEEP YOUR DAMNED HOOVES OFF<br>THE SEATS. That's just fucked up."

The next express bus came<br>10 minutes later, but then I would end up being a few<br>minutes late to work... and I HATE HATE HATE being late,<br>even if no one else cares.One morning I decided to email the<br>CTA and ask them why they got rid of this bus run, thus<br>putting about 30 minutes between two express buses in the<br>morning.Here's the key - I didn't email them and act super<br>bitchy like I'm sure a million people do. I simply asked a<br>question, gave them the information from the bus schedule on<br>their site so they would know exactly which bus I was<br>talking about, and I even took a screen shot of the bus<br>tracker so they could see that there was a bus missing.The<br>NEXT MORNING... as in, less than 24 hours after I sent my<br>email, they had a supervisor at my usual bus stop. He asked<br>a few of us waiting if we were waiting for that specific<br>bus, and we all said yes. We all told him it hasn't been<br>coming for a few weeks, and at first he was sarcastic with<br>us... until he saw we were right. Oooh, burn, CTA man!A few<br>hours later the CTA emailed me, letting me know that I was<br>correct (don't you love hearing that?), there was a problem<br>with that run and the supervisors were on it.It took a<br>couple days, but now that run is back to it's regular<br>schedule, and so am I.

I have been holding my tongue about<br>providing you feedback on your services but I have to admit<br>that all my frustration has finally built up and I am now<br>ready to give you a piece of my mind. Now, let's start<br>discussing the pros before I nail you with all the ugly<br>cons, shall we?PROS:-BART is VERY convenient (Well, so I<br>thought). I decided to move work locations because,<br>honestly, public transportation is better than driving to<br>work especially with the high increase of traffic within the<br>last couple of years. -BART has stations in almost all key<br>parts of the Bay Area. There is literally no need to drive<br>in the Bay Area!CONS:-BART is not the MOST reliable form of<br>transportation. No matter how early I get up for work....I<br>can NEVER make it to work on time because of those damn BART<br>delays! COME ON, BART! We have to get better at this. I do<br>understand that \"things happen\" but this is happening WAYYYY<br>to much. -Every other morning there seems to be come<br>suspicious activity happening in SAn Francisco BART Stations<br>and once my train gets to West Oakland Bart the operator<br>announces that the BART train is going out of service! WHAT?<br>INSANE! So EVERYONE off boards the train then 2 minute later<br>the operator comes back and states that the train is back in<br>service! OMG! TIP for you? Why don't you tell your operators<br>to NOT off board people on the train until they are CERTAIN<br>the train will be going out of service, please!-Okay, I<br>understand that there have been new operators and it may be<br>there first time driving a big train BUT I am really<br>starting to hate the sudden stops that occur when I am<br>trying to enjoy my ride. The operators slam on the brakes<br>and all you see are people flying all over the train. I have<br>to admit that there have been times that I have lost my<br>balance because of the sudden stops. Please BART, let's get<br>it together!I have to admit, that I thought BART topped any<br>and all public transportation in the world until I went to<br>Hong Kong and seen there transportation and was WOW'd!https:<br>//www.yelp.com/biz_photos/%E6%B8%AF%E9%90%B5%E6%9F%AF%E5%A3%<br>AB%E7%94%B8%E7%AB%99-<br>%E9%A6%99%E6%B8%AF?select=Pr1Qk5KD0JY_C0YpMwsBdw BART, just<br>a word of advice?  How about you follow the model from HK<br>and I truly believe that we can reduce some of the delays<br>and people killing themselves on the tracks! I really hope<br>BART gets better at these delays! It's frustrating and quite<br>ridiculous, if you ask me! Let's work on being on time. Oh<br>yea, what happened to the new trains that we are supposed to<br>be seeing? Oh yea and you give fees for riders who take up 2<br>seats, right? Well, who is responsible for catching those<br>people? Because every morning the homeless are sleeping on<br>the seats and ride the train from start to end and NO ONE is<br>able to sit down! ARGHH!

Price goes down if you buy the yearly Navigo<br>pass. People who work at the Metro stations are super nice<br>and never have attitudes. (French) riders on the trains are<br>nice, reserved and clean. The trains manage to go incredibly<br>fast without ever creating a screeching noise so loud it<br>almost makes your ears bleed. Also, people in France don't<br>poop on the trains. And, even if they did, unlike on BART<br>here is no rarely cleaned carpet to sop-up, collect and<br>store all the blood, vomit, feces, urine etc. which<br>constitute all those stains on the floor of the BART. I'm<br>sure the carpet on BART was an attempt to find a material to<br>absorb with painful screeching noise - a result of engineers<br>with no knowledge of aerodynamic design.The metro system was<br>built before 1920. The BART was built between 1964 and 1972<br>-- by then engineers had gotten us to the moon! and even<br>with all the good examples of trains in the world BART<br>planners still couldn't get it right!!!]  Original review:<br>The Best Night Ever for BART was the night the new De Young<br>Museum opened. There was also some bridge construction going<br>on so the BART ran all night long. Even at 3:00 in the<br>morning there were something like 10,000 people on the<br>grounds of the De Young waiting to get in or just hanging<br>out.Coming home to Berkeley at 4:30 in the morning the whole<br>train was packed to the gills. There were hipsters and<br>business people and drag queens and gang-looking kids and<br>college students and distinguished looking seniors all<br>crowded in together returning home from a night on the town.<br>Suddenly the whole car broke out together in a rendition of<br>some song -- I feel like it was Elton John or James Taylor<br>-- something very 70s cheesy AM radio, and it was all so<br>magical.The BART should run all night. I will never<br>understand how this can be a \"World Class City\" when you<br>cannot even stay out until 2am unless you have 40 bucks plus<br>tip to get back across the bay in a hard-to-find taxi, or<br>want to drive drunk. A friend of mine who is really into<br>Railroad History recounted to me a story that the reason<br>BART is such a money pit and cannot afford to (stay running<br>at night, finish looping the bay, charge us compassionate<br>fares, etc.)  is because when it was first designed (the<br>business? the people? the government? I forget this<br>essential fact!) wanted it to be designed so that it could<br>never be annexed by (other?) businesses and used for hauling<br>materials, so they designed the rails to non-standard size<br>and designed cars that couldn't use standardized parts. So<br>everytime something breaks down it has to be specially<br>ordered and manufactured, unlike Caltrain. (sp?) -- If they<br>had just used standardized train parts like NYC, etc. then<br>they could afford to run and charge less. I am willing to<br>believe this story is true until I am confronted with<br>contrary evidence.UPDATE: Go read the Bay Area Rapid Transit<br>page on the Wikipedia - there it outlines the whole story as<br>to what I tried to say above.The Wiki also had this funny<br>note:\"Peter Hall, author of the book Great Planning<br>Disasters, describes BART as one of the sensational planning<br>disasters of the 20th century, alongside the Anglo-French<br>Concorde and the Sydney Opera House.\" -- ha!On a final<br>downer note, TWO times I have seen coiled piles of actual<br>human poop on the carpet of the BART. I don't know what they<br>clean that carpet with but I hope it is CDC approved.It<br>makes me want to have one of those CDC/Hot<br>Zone/Nasa/Silkwood decontamination showers installed at the<br>door to my house."

                      "3.5 stars...I don't have a lot of experience using the BART<br>system but enough to voice a little review. BART is the<br>subway/train system allowing San Franciscians to get in and<br>out of the city and to bringing people to and from the<br>airport. The trains and stations I found to be pretty clean,<br>the seats on the train to be comfortable, and the BART map<br>and automated ticketing stations to be extremely easy to<br>read. Prices for BART tickets are a tad high (it's $8.10 to<br>get from downtown to the airport), and at the moment there<br>is no card to allow you unlimited access to all of BART and<br>MUNI (though if you only need BART within city limits the<br>Clipper Card would probably work for you). The system within<br>the city is limited so don't expect to use BART to get<br>around San Francisco but it is the best way to get out of<br>the city for a day if you don't have a car. If you're more<br>familiar with NYC transportation MUNI is like the MTA and<br>BART is like the LIRR (or Metro North or NJT). I have 3 main<br>issues with BART, first is that there are a few lines and<br>it's not 100% clear which line you're getting on (only the<br>direction), the second is that there aren't any<br>announcements on what stop you're arriving at (and if there<br>is an announcement it's completely inaudible), and the last<br>issue is that when the doors open at a stop its extremely<br>hard to figure out which stop your at because it's only<br>labeled with small letters every 200 or so feet so you've<br>got to do a lot of careful and quick scanning to make sure<br>you're not missing your stop. BART isn't the worst sytem in<br>the world but it definitely has its kinks."

Even a beater car or truck will cost you<br>more in the long run. * No matter where you live in the 5<br>boroughs, your destination is less than an hour away, so<br>long as you know how to take the bus and can understand the<br>coverage maps. Before you throw your hands up and declare<br>the system too confusing to bother with, take an afternoon<br>to memorize the maps. It really helps. * The stations are<br>safe, and most are quiet and acceptably clean. Many folks<br>have vivid memories of MTA trains and stations in the<br>Beame/Koch years and the customer experience has improved by<br>leaps and bounds since then. * Manhattan coverage is<br>arranged on a logical grid system, and identifying which<br>lines take you where is a breeze if you think about them as<br>\"the Lex\" instead of \"4/5/6\" or \"6th Ave. line\" instead of<br>\"B/D/F/M.\"* Even if you live beyond a train line, such as in<br>far Eastern Queens or Southern Brooklyn, you will find<br>multiple buses that take you where you need to go. * Most<br>lines run 24/7/365, unlike any other public transit system<br>in the USA.Are our trains and buses sometimes late,<br>occasionally missing (during strikes or inclement weather),<br>and infrequently smelly?

I've been using CTA religiously for the<br>past three (3) years ever since I moved to Chicago from a<br>small town America that everyone there owns at least two (2)<br>cars, one (1) truck, and one (1) John Deer.  It felt so good<br>to be back in a major city where I can do my thang without<br>having to be vehicle-dependent.  Riding CTA isn't just to<br>commute to/from work for me; it's my life style.  I put my<br>$100 CTA/Pace monthly premium pass to work on my days off.<br>I ride busses and \"L\" to get to places.  I sometimes invite<br>my hubby along with the ride.  Yes, I'm hangin\" out the<br>passenger ride, of my bestie CTA's ride, but I'm hollering<br>at no one...just wanting to enjoy my own solitude.  CTA and<br>I's relationship isn't always peachy.  Often times waiting<br>for busses or trains can be an excruciating experience,<br>especially in the brutal winter season.  Yet what else can I<br>do?  Bundle up, dress in layers, listen to some K-pop, and<br>start dancing with it to keep my body temperature stable.<br>For the most part trains and busses are \"on-time.\"  After<br>all it's public transportation.  You always want to plan<br>ahead, know the bus schedule somewhat, and familiarize<br>yourself with the immediate surroundings (i.g. the closest<br>place for bathroom, the nearest coffee shop, and the most<br>convenient take-out restaurant for a quick bite).  Most bus<br>drivers, train operators, and station employees seem nice<br>and helpful.  Of course they have their \"moments,\" just like<br>every other human being living the in the universe.<br>Nevertheless, safety is their number one priority.  Out of<br>three (3) years riding every various CTA bus routes, there<br>only has been one (1) accident (not really an<br>accident....but the bus driver ran into something small).<br>Anyways, they've got my \"reliability\" vote.  Patronizing CTA<br>is definitely not a luxurious experience, and this is<br>certainly not everyone's cup of tea.  Some friends even<br>asked if I ever felt like I would be getting shot.

I<br>was on the train when some dude leapt onto the tracks at<br>Civic Center and held up the entire system for hours.  Thank<br>god for Muni, but, having some sort of barrier between the<br>passengers would keep bodies off the track, keep other sorts<br>of debris off the track, and stop that wind tunnel effect<br>when trains come roaring into the station (esp. at 24th and<br>Mission)- Run earlier and have more frequent trains on the<br>weekends.

By doing this, we can make inferences on how and why public transit affects its respecitive cities and the corresponding population, which can be useful in explaining usage trends."
