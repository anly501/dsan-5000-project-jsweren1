4,"Jul 2, 2007","I've seen things dirtier, smellier, just downright nastier than the Bay Area Rapid Transit system or BART, as we call it. I can't give it 5 stars, but this system has gotten me from Point A to B without much complication for the last 20 years. Just needs new seats and carpet, perhaps even some security. Why does Bart Police exist?"
5,"Nov 16, 2007","Coming from LA, we took the BART to Powell Street! This was great. It took us right where we needed to be. Why can't LA have such great transportation. Yes even though it was quite crowded from SFO to downtown, it was so convenient and for $5.15 its cheaper than a taxi too."
3,"Dec 25, 2007","Public transportation is extremely important, and we're fortunate to have BART-! still... it could do a lot better of a job. I think people praise it here because Californians are so used to the idea of not having public transportation that they have very low standards. Anyone who's been around the world and seen metros in place in cities much poorer than San Francisco would be hard-pressed to call the BART fantastic.Going from the East Bay to the west Bay to commute to work is *very* expensive, although it did bring down my auto insurance rates a few hundred dollars a year. I'm talking like $120 a month just to go to work...  this is not an affordable option for low income people, but it beats driving a car.And the midnight closures... geez! what's with that? That being said, it's remarkable that BART's in place, and considering the history of Californian government, corruption goes hand in hand with projects like the Bay Bridge, MUNI & the BART. It's also bad to compare the bart to other systems since they depend on so much funding from the fares--Bay area people should definitely cough up more money for the BART, whether it's through some form of gas tax or auto tax..."

Fruitvale to Montgomery and Civic Center to Fruitvale..I'm very particular  on where I sit so I don't get motion sickness, either sideways or facing forward.... never ride backwards... NEVER... I must say though I love to eaves drop on conversation and stare at people... If someone were to ask me on Bart if I had a staring problem, I would have to respond with, ""Why yes... Yes I do!!!"" I've thought numerous times about writing a book about my travels on Bart...."" Confessions on a Bart train""... but alas I am always to drained from the Bart ride to write...."
3,"Aug 14, 2009","BART is not like the New York or Tokyo subways. Trains are infrequent, it's expensive, people don't really know how to act...but it gets the job done and it often beats driving. And i'm sure it would be way better if people were willing to pay more tax. Let's see how much we really need BART when they go on strike.On the other hand, F*** the bart strikers."
3,"Mar 17, 2011","What's with the people who ride the BART? I've never seen so many horribly dressed people at the same time in a small metal tube in my entire life. One time I felt the need to flee at the site of a homeless man running full speed through the BART with no shoes on. His feet looked really gross and it scared me! I'm from Seattle, and apparently our lack of good and efficient public transportation did not prepare me for riding the BART. The BART does get you where you need to go though, so 5 stars for that."
4,"May 22, 2006","Compared to most cities mass transit, I'll take BART any day of the week. Compared to something like Path in Jersey or Metrorail in upstate/connecticut, Bart ain't that expensive and is pretty reliable most of the time. Only thing I hate about it is the refusal to run overnight. Even if it was just one train an hour, that would make a HUGE difference."
3,"Jun 25, 2009","Really is OK. If I were a pragmatist, BART would be getting 2 stars, lucky for them I'm a train fan.Here goes: faster service, cleaner cars, cleaner stations, lower fares, more frequent service, less pay to employees, better managers/directors and newer rail cars are just some of the thousands of ways BART NEEDS to improve.I'm going to take Muni instead until BART gets itself together, lowers its  fare and restores normal service (referring to fare increase and service cuts for July/Sep 09)."
5,"Dec 17, 2010","Public transportation is the key if you're low on funds and/or care about leaving a decent environment for your children to grow up in. There's not a vast quantity of public transport in LA so it's a relatively new idea for me.  The biggest problem is that I'm directionally challenged so getting on and off the right train was difficult... Luckily I had some friends there to guide me otherwise I'm not sure where I would've ended up!  Overall, I'm pleased with the system they set up in this magnificent city. Next time I'll pay more attention and I'm sure I'll be just fine."
1,"Jan 22, 2016","FARE EVADERSIn light of the recent fare increase, I get quite irritated when I see a fare evader.  I see it occur about 3 times per week.  I see this crime so often that I now can tell when someone is about to evade the fare by watching their body language.  They begin to look over at where the station agent is located.  Often the station agent is busy/talking to another station agent/distracted/assisting a customer.  The fare evader walks to the turnstile which is located farthest from the station agent, and positions himself very close to the customer in front of him who is in the process of going through the turnstile.  Then the fare evader quickly runs through before or during the seconds that the turnstile gate closes.  Often, the fare evader has a very satisfied look on his face, that he never pays for a BART ride, and never intends to pay again.  Can you imagine how many thousands of dollars BART may be losing?  (And we, the honest people, are paying higher fares for?)  If me, just one person, is seeing the thieves evade the fare at least 3 times per week, there must be many, many more that are unseen.One evening recently at the Pittsburg station, I witnessed another fare evader and decided I had seen enough.  I went up to the station agent, told her what I saw in a loud voice, and pointed to the fare evader.  The fare evader saw me do this.  The station agent did not try to detain him.  She did not announce anything on the speaker system.  As I was leaving the station, the fare evader followed me and told me that he ""was tired of people like me doing things to his people.""  I assumed he was trying to make my reporting of his crime to the station agent into a racial issue (I am white; he was black.)  He kept following me so I turned around and yelled as loudly as I could, asking for someone to call BART police.  After 15 seconds of my screaming, he wandered away and got on a bus.  I called BART police myself, but they never appeared.One time I asked a station agent about the prevalence of these fare evaders.  He told me the following:  ""the Board of Directors at BART have instructed us to not to do anything about it.""Twice, I have called the ""Comments and Complaints"" phone line to voice my concern about this, and asked what is BART's policy on dealing with the fare evaders.  I asked if they could please return my call.  I have never heard back from BART.  That phone line is: 510- 464-7134.EATING AND DRINKING ON TRAINSBART has signs posted in the stations and inside the train cars prohibiting eating and drinking.  It is announced on the speaker system via a recorded message, and the consequence when caught is a $250 fine.  Yet there are a good number of people who ignore the rules.  I wouldn't care so much about this normally - but I have realized how these rule breakers can actually cause a danger to other passengers.  When liquids are spilled on the floor, passengers can slip and fall.  I was in the same car as a woman who spilled her coffee right before the train departed the station.  Then I observed how the coffee ""traveled"" all over the floor of the car, expanding further each time the train stopped and began moving again.On my trip each morning, the train begins to become very crowded, especially at the MacArthur station.  I see people carrying tall, hot, paper cups of coffee.  They are standing up holding the coffee, and they are positioned extremely close to other passengers.  If the train comes to a sudden stop (which happens often), and if that hot coffee spills on fellow passengers, then doesn't BART recognize the potential lawsuit(s)?Additionally, scraps of food, ketchup, mustard, and other food items are seen on the seats, even in the morning, when you would think that the trains should have been cleaned prior to the morning commute.  Shells from nuts and seeds, chips, Cheetos, open cans of soda, and water bottles roll on the floor."

1,"Dec 1, 2022","I went to a concert at chase center and it took an hour of waiting for a train to The east bay. Crazy people on the train threatening people, strange homeless men walking around the station looking for trouble. Never ever take Bart home at night after 10:00"
1,"Dec 13, 2022",BART lost my commuting ridership for two reasons:1) It's insulting and infuriating to me that basically every fifth person just jumps over the gates for free and no one cares. I'm paying full price and the free riders act like it's their right.2) The majority of the free riders are vagrant drug attics. The do their drugs in the train often smoking something that smell synthetic that eve permeates your mask. They leave their garbage in the train. A lot are also mentally unstable and make the train unsafe. Some may scoff but this is reality!I would propose that Bart does a pilot program to install New York like gates that go all the way up. Test this at a pilot station then install more. Until the two points I listed above are addressed I would rather pay more to park than ride Bart. It's sad because I know Bart has a budget deficit and decreased ridership. But the Bay Area needs Bart!
1,"Jul 11, 2023","Don't I wish I could use public transportation but by all means, it doesn't work for me. The location in question - Berryessa San Jose. Once again, there are no Zeros or negative numbers in the Star options. The ""brief"" version:It took me almost 5 minutes to find a ticket machine for parking to pay, more out of orders than working ones, finally I made it - too bad I missed the first train. I have a Clipper account, charged with $30 (months ago), have the Clipper App downloaded and it confirms the $30 on the card, using an Android phone with NFC and I thought I am ready to go. Well, the card reader that did not have the ""out of order"" sticker did not cooperate. It was very persistent telling me please touch card again. So, it recognized there was a card - my phone with NFC - but it refused to let me into the station. After many attempts at all possible entrances, I pressed the ""help button"". The recommendation was to call Clipper, they are responsible :( I called and they told me, the Clipper App is not what I need, I need Google wallet to get in. Okay, I downloaded Google wallet and sure enough the Clipper card showed up with a $30 amount, isn't life wonderful :) Unfortunately the next train just left the station. Here we go, convinced the stupid Clipper system finally lets me in - WRONG - same message, please touch card again at all possible scanners I found. At the main entrance I found a lady from BART, explained my situation and what I tried, she apologized profoundly and recommended to buy a new plastic Clipper card, charging it with another amount to use it. Most of the Clipper machines where out of order and the one working did not offer a ""buy Clipper card"" option. She tried to use my phone as well to get in, no such luck. The whole user / customer / passenger (not really) experience was worse than ever before when it was much easier to buy a ticket for a single ride. The next train was gone by now and after about 40 minutes utterly frustrated, I decided to skip my trip to SFO as I was in such a bad mood, nothing positive was to be expected.What I did not mention, this was the second time with a very similar experience, the first time I had to drive to Oakland airport to pick up my daughter instead of taking BART. Maybe I was just an outlier, but I need to make sure that there is a record of the overall miserable customer experience at this location. Don't think that BART is a viable alternative for people like myself using the (well trying to use) the transit system every now and them.I am a big fan of public transportation, if it works, like it does in other countries, but I do understand if people in the Bay Area consider it a waste of money subsidizing BART.Just close it down and provide free UBER or LYFT, probably cheaper and for sure more reliable."
1,"Dec 12, 2022","It is so vile and disgusting being on the train. The train reeked of cigarettes and the next car reeked of pot. Homeless and their gear all over the place. Food and drink containers all over the floor in multiple cars. Food and candy on the ultra dirty seats, above a dirty sticky floor. Covid would be scared of this monstrosity, and leave the train. A ripped seat  on the floor. The foul smell bad body order.  Dirty clothes on the floor with no owner in sight.  Then a few people jump the exit without paying. BART should be disgusted with itself."

3,"Jun 9, 2022","I recently took BART for the first time since the 1970's when it opened to get from SFO to Berkeley. It was so efficient and I am so grateful that it exists. However, it was not the best experience people-wise and that is not so much a reflection of BART as it is of the times.A crack addict rode near me and scratched, genuflected and spewed some kind of dander all over the place while panhandlers sauntered about asking for handouts. An armed policeman walked through many minutes after this had all occurred. That is a 1-star review experience, my friends. The elevator and grounds were sketchy and kinda gross."
3,"Jan 18, 2023","Took the train to the Oakland Airport from North Concord on a Sunday.Ride was good until I transferred to the Coliseum. Glad I don't do this often.I did take BART back home two weeks later.  It wasn't any better, but on a positive note, the senior clipper pass is a good deal!"
3,"Oct 11, 2022","Why on earth are the announcements so soft? Who are you talking to? Nobody can hear a thing above the noise. Also the milbrea/sfo is a pain - sometimes sfo first, sometimes milbrea, sometimes ending at sfo and going back missing milbrea. What the heck at least announce something we can hear so I don't have to watch every station at the end - pain since the boards never make it clear before boarding - almost seems random - nobody laughing and constantly people getting the wrong stop"

1,"Jul 11, 2023","Don't I wish I could use public transportation but by all means, it doesn't work for me. The location in question - Berryessa San Jose. Once again, there are no Zeros or negative numbers in the Star options. The ""brief"" version:It took me almost 5 minutes to find a ticket machine for parking to pay, more out of orders than working ones, finally I made it - too bad I missed the first train. I have a Clipper account, charged with $30 (months ago), have the Clipper App downloaded and it confirms the $30 on the card, using an Android phone with NFC and I thought I am ready to go. Well, the card reader that did not have the ""out of order"" sticker did not cooperate. It was very persistent telling me please touch card again. So, it recognized there was a card - my phone with NFC - but it refused to let me into the station. After many attempts at all possible entrances, I pressed the ""help button"". The recommendation was to call Clipper, they are responsible :( I called and they told me, the Clipper App is not what I need, I need Google wallet to get in. Okay, I downloaded Google wallet and sure enough the Clipper card showed up with a $30 amount, isn't life wonderful :) Unfortunately the next train just left the station. Here we go, convinced the stupid Clipper system finally lets me in - WRONG - same message, please touch card again at all possible scanners I found. At the main entrance I found a lady from BART, explained my situation and what I tried, she apologized profoundly and recommended to buy a new plastic Clipper card, charging it with another amount to use it. Most of the Clipper machines where out of order and the one working did not offer a ""buy Clipper card"" option. She tried to use my phone as well to get in, no such luck. The whole user / customer / passenger (not really) experience was worse than ever before when it was much easier to buy a ticket for a single ride. The next train was gone by now and after about 40 minutes utterly frustrated, I decided to skip my trip to SFO as I was in such a bad mood, nothing positive was to be expected.What I did not mention, this was the second time with a very similar experience, the first time I had to drive to Oakland airport to pick up my daughter instead of taking BART. Maybe I was just an outlier, but I need to make sure that there is a record of the overall miserable customer experience at this location. Don't think that BART is a viable alternative for people like myself using the (well trying to use) the transit system every now and them.I am a big fan of public transportation, if it works, like it does in other countries, but I do understand if people in the Bay Area consider it a waste of money subsidizing BART.Just close it down and provide free UBER or LYFT, probably cheaper and for sure more reliable."
1,"Dec 12, 2022","It is so vile and disgusting being on the train. The train reeked of cigarettes and the next car reeked of pot. Homeless and their gear all over the place. Food and drink containers all over the floor in multiple cars. Food and candy on the ultra dirty seats, above a dirty sticky floor. Covid would be scared of this monstrosity, and leave the train. A ripped seat  on the floor. The foul smell bad body order.  Dirty clothes on the floor with no owner in sight.  Then a few people jump the exit without paying. BART should be disgusted with itself."

3,"Jun 9, 2022","I recently took BART for the first time since the 1970's when it opened to get from SFO to Berkeley. It was so efficient and I am so grateful that it exists. However, it was not the best experience people-wise and that is not so much a reflection of BART as it is of the times.A crack addict rode near me and scratched, genuflected and spewed some kind of dander all over the place while panhandlers sauntered about asking for handouts. An armed policeman walked through many minutes after this had all occurred. That is a 1-star review experience, my friends. The elevator and grounds were sketchy and kinda gross."

1,"Dec 1, 2022","I went to a concert at chase center and it took an hour of waiting for a train to The east bay. Crazy people on the train threatening people, strange homeless men walking around the station looking for trouble. Never ever take Bart home at night after 10:00"
1,"Dec 13, 2022",BART lost my commuting ridership for two reasons:1) It's insulting and infuriating to me that basically every fifth person just jumps over the gates for free and no one cares. I'm paying full price and the free riders act like it's their right.2) The majority of the free riders are vagrant drug attics. The do their drugs in the train often smoking something that smell synthetic that eve permeates your mask. They leave their garbage in the train. A lot are also mentally unstable and make the train unsafe. Some may scoff but this is reality!I would propose that Bart does a pilot program to install New York like gates that go all the way up. Test this at a pilot station then install more. Until the two points I listed above are addressed I would rather pay more to park than ride Bart. It's sad because I know Bart has a budget deficit and decreased ridership. But the Bay Area needs Bart!
1,"Jul 11, 2023","Don't I wish I could use public transportation but by all means, it doesn't work for me. The location in question - Berryessa San Jose. Once again, there are no Zeros or negative numbers in the Star options. The ""brief"" version:It took me almost 5 minutes to find a ticket machine for parking to pay, more out of orders than working ones, finally I made it - too bad I missed the first train. I have a Clipper account, charged with $30 (months ago), have the Clipper App downloaded and it confirms the $30 on the card, using an Android phone with NFC and I thought I am ready to go. Well, the card reader that did not have the ""out of order"" sticker did not cooperate. It was very persistent telling me please touch card again. So, it recognized there was a card - my phone with NFC - but it refused to let me into the station. After many attempts at all possible entrances, I pressed the ""help button"". The recommendation was to call Clipper, they are responsible :( I called and they told me, the Clipper App is not what I need, I need Google wallet to get in. Okay, I downloaded Google wallet and sure enough the Clipper card showed up with a $30 amount, isn't life wonderful :) Unfortunately the next train just left the station. Here we go, convinced the stupid Clipper system finally lets me in - WRONG - same message, please touch card again at all possible scanners I found. At the main entrance I found a lady from BART, explained my situation and what I tried, she apologized profoundly and recommended to buy a new plastic Clipper card, charging it with another amount to use it. Most of the Clipper machines where out of order and the one working did not offer a ""buy Clipper card"" option. She tried to use my phone as well to get in, no such luck. The whole user / customer / passenger (not really) experience was worse than ever before when it was much easier to buy a ticket for a single ride. The next train was gone by now and after about 40 minutes utterly frustrated, I decided to skip my trip to SFO as I was in such a bad mood, nothing positive was to be expected.What I did not mention, this was the second time with a very similar experience, the first time I had to drive to Oakland airport to pick up my daughter instead of taking BART. Maybe I was just an outlier, but I need to make sure that there is a record of the overall miserable customer experience at this location. Don't think that BART is a viable alternative for people like myself using the (well trying to use) the transit system every now and them.I am a big fan of public transportation, if it works, like it does in other countries, but I do understand if people in the Bay Area consider it a waste of money subsidizing BART.Just close it down and provide free UBER or LYFT, probably cheaper and for sure more reliable."
1,"Dec 12, 2022","It is so vile and disgusting being on the train. The train reeked of cigarettes and the next car reeked of pot. Homeless and their gear all over the place.

A ripped seat  on the floor. The foul smell bad body order.  Dirty clothes on the floor with no owner in sight.  Then a few people jump the exit without paying. BART should be disgusted with itself."

The whole user / customer / passenger (not really) experience was worse than ever before when it was much easier to buy a ticket for a single ride. The next train was gone by now and after about 40 minutes utterly frustrated, I decided to skip my trip to SFO as I was in such a bad mood, nothing positive was to be expected.What I did not mention, this was the second time with a very similar experience, the first time I had to drive to Oakland airport to pick up my daughter instead of taking BART. Maybe I was just an outlier, but I need to make sure that there is a record of the overall miserable customer experience at this location. Don't think that BART is a viable alternative for people like myself using the (well trying to use) the transit system every now and them.I am a big fan of public transportation, if it works, like it does in other countries, but I do understand if people in the Bay Area consider it a waste of money subsidizing BART.Just close it down and provide free UBER or LYFT, probably cheaper and for sure more reliable."
1,"Dec 12, 2022","It is so vile and disgusting being on the train. The train reeked of cigarettes and the next car reeked of pot. Homeless and their gear all over the place. Food and drink containers all over the floor in multiple cars. Food and candy on the ultra dirty seats, above a dirty sticky floor. Covid would be scared of this monstrosity, and leave the train. A ripped seat  on the floor. The foul smell bad body order.  Dirty clothes on the floor with no owner in sight.  Then a few people jump the exit without paying. BART should be disgusted with itself."

3,"Jun 9, 2022","I recently took BART for the first time since the 1970's when it opened to get from SFO to Berkeley. It was so efficient and I am so grateful that it exists. However, it was not the best experience people-wise and that is not so much a reflection of BART as it is of the times.A crack addict rode near me and scratched, genuflected and spewed some kind of dander all over the place while panhandlers sauntered about asking for handouts. An armed policeman walked through many minutes after this had all occurred. That is a 1-star review experience, my friends. The elevator and grounds were sketchy and kinda gross."

1,"Dec 13, 2022",BART lost my commuting ridership for two reasons:1) It's insulting and infuriating to me that basically every fifth person just jumps over the gates for free and no one cares. I'm paying full price and the free riders act like it's their right.2) The majority of the free riders are vagrant drug attics. The do their drugs in the train often smoking something that smell synthetic that eve permeates your mask. They leave their garbage in the train. A lot are also mentally unstable and make the train unsafe. Some may scoff but this is reality!I would propose that Bart does a pilot program to install New York like gates that go all the way up. Test this at a pilot station then install more. Until the two points I listed above are addressed I would rather pay more to park than ride Bart. It's sad because I know Bart has a budget deficit and decreased ridership. But the Bay Area needs Bart!

I have a Clipper account, charged with $30 (months ago), have the Clipper App downloaded and it confirms the $30 on the card, using an Android phone with NFC and I thought I am ready to go. Well, the card reader that did not have the ""out of order"" sticker did not cooperate. It was very persistent telling me please touch card again. So, it recognized there was a card - my phone with NFC - but it refused to let me into the station. After many attempts at all possible entrances, I pressed the ""help button"". The recommendation was to call Clipper, they are responsible :( I called and they told me, the Clipper App is not what I need, I need Google wallet to get in. Okay, I downloaded Google wallet and sure enough the Clipper card showed up with a $30 amount, isn't life wonderful :) Unfortunately the next train just left the station.

1,"Dec 13, 2022",BART lost my commuting ridership for two reasons:1) It's insulting and infuriating to me that basically every fifth person just jumps over the gates for free and no one cares. I'm paying full price and the free riders act like it's their right.2) The majority of the free riders are vagrant drug attics. The do their drugs in the train often smoking something that smell synthetic that eve permeates your mask. They leave their garbage in the train. A lot are also mentally unstable and make the train unsafe. Some may scoff but this is reality!I would propose that Bart does a pilot program to install New York like gates that go all the way up. Test this at a pilot station then install more. Until the two points I listed above are addressed I would rather pay more to park than ride Bart. It's sad because I know Bart has a budget deficit and decreased ridership. But the Bay Area needs Bart!
1,"Jul 11, 2023","Don't I wish I could use public transportation but by all means, it doesn't work for me. The location in question - Berryessa San Jose. Once again, there are no Zeros or negative numbers in the Star options. The ""brief"" version:It took me almost 5 minutes to find a ticket machine for parking to pay, more out of orders than working ones, finally I made it - too bad I missed the first train. I have a Clipper account, charged with $30 (months ago), have the Clipper App downloaded and it confirms the $30 on the card, using an Android phone with NFC and I thought I am ready to go. Well, the card reader that did not have the ""out of order"" sticker did not cooperate. It was very persistent telling me please touch card again. So, it recognized there was a card - my phone with NFC - but it refused to let me into the station. After many attempts at all possible entrances, I pressed the ""help button"". The recommendation was to call Clipper, they are responsible :( I called and they told me, the Clipper App is not what I need, I need Google wallet to get in. Okay, I downloaded Google wallet and sure enough the Clipper card showed up with a $30 amount, isn't life wonderful :) Unfortunately the next train just left the station. Here we go, convinced the stupid Clipper system finally lets me in - WRONG - same message, please touch card again at all possible scanners I found. At the main entrance I found a lady from BART, explained my situation and what I tried, she apologized profoundly and recommended to buy a new plastic Clipper card, charging it with another amount to use it. Most of the Clipper machines where out of order and the one working did not offer a ""buy Clipper card"" option. She tried to use my phone as well to get in, no such luck. The whole user / customer / passenger (not really) experience was worse than ever before when it was much easier to buy a ticket for a single ride. The next train was gone by now and after about 40 minutes utterly frustrated, I decided to skip my trip to SFO as I was in such a bad mood, nothing positive was to be expected.What I did not mention, this was the second time with a very similar experience, the first time I had to drive to Oakland airport to pick up my daughter instead of taking BART. Maybe I was just an outlier, but I need to make sure that there is a record of the overall miserable customer experience at this location. Don't think that BART is a viable alternative for people like myself using the (well trying to use) the transit system every now and them.I am a big fan of public transportation, if it works, like it does in other countries, but I do understand if people in the Bay Area consider it a waste of money subsidizing BART.Just close it down and provide free UBER or LYFT, probably cheaper and for sure more reliable."
1,"Dec 12, 2022","It is so vile and disgusting being on the train. The train reeked of cigarettes and the next car reeked of pot. Homeless and their gear all over the place. Food and drink containers all over the floor in multiple cars. Food and candy on the ultra dirty seats, above a dirty sticky floor. Covid would be scared of this monstrosity, and leave the train. A ripped seat  on the floor. The foul smell bad body order.  Dirty clothes on the floor with no owner in sight.  Then a few people jump the exit without paying. BART should be disgusted with itself."

3,"Jun 9, 2022","I recently took BART for the first time since the 1970's when it opened to get from SFO to Berkeley. It was so efficient and I am so grateful that it exists. However, it was not the best experience people-wise and that is not so much a reflection of BART as it is of the times.A crack addict rode near me and scratched, genuflected and spewed some kind of dander all over the place while panhandlers sauntered about asking for handouts. An armed policeman walked through many minutes after this had all occurred. That is a 1-star review experience, my friends. The elevator and grounds were sketchy and kinda gross."

3,"Oct 11, 2022","Why on earth are the announcements so soft? Who are you talking to? Nobody can hear a thing above the noise.

3,"Jun 9, 2022","I recently took BART for the first time since the 1970's when it opened to get from SFO to Berkeley. It was so efficient and I am so grateful that it exists.

An armed policeman walked through many minutes after this had all occurred. That is a 1-star review experience, my friends. The elevator and grounds were sketchy and kinda gross."

1,"Dec 13, 2022",BART lost my commuting ridership for two reasons:1) It's insulting and infuriating to me that basically every fifth person just jumps over the gates for free and no one cares. I'm paying full price and the free riders act like it's their right.2) The majority of the free riders are vagrant drug attics. The do their drugs in the train often smoking something that smell synthetic that eve permeates your mask. They leave their garbage in the train. A lot are also mentally unstable and make the train unsafe. Some may scoff but this is reality!I would propose that Bart does a pilot program to install New York like gates that go all the way up. Test this at a pilot station then install more. Until the two points I listed above are addressed I would rather pay more to park than ride Bart. It's sad because I know Bart has a budget deficit and decreased ridership. But the Bay Area needs Bart!
1,"Jul 11, 2023","Don't I wish I could use public transportation but by all means, it doesn't work for me. The location in question - Berryessa San Jose. Once again, there are no Zeros or negative numbers in the Star options. The ""brief"" version:It took me almost 5 minutes to find a ticket machine for parking to pay, more out of orders than working ones, finally I made it - too bad I missed the first train. I have a Clipper account, charged with $30 (months ago), have the Clipper App downloaded and it confirms the $30 on the card, using an Android phone with NFC and I thought I am ready to go. Well, the card reader that did not have the ""out of order"" sticker did not cooperate. It was very persistent telling me please touch card again. So, it recognized there was a card - my phone with NFC - but it refused to let me into the station. After many attempts at all possible entrances, I pressed the ""help button"". The recommendation was to call Clipper, they are responsible :( I called and they told me, the Clipper App is not what I need, I need Google wallet to get in. Okay, I downloaded Google wallet and sure enough the Clipper card showed up with a $30 amount, isn't life wonderful :) Unfortunately the next train just left the station. Here we go, convinced the stupid Clipper system finally lets me in - WRONG - same message, please touch card again at all possible scanners I found. At the main entrance I found a lady from BART, explained my situation and what I tried, she apologized profoundly and recommended to buy a new plastic Clipper card, charging it with another amount to use it. Most of the Clipper machines where out of order and the one working did not offer a ""buy Clipper card"" option. She tried to use my phone as well to get in, no such luck. The whole user / customer / passenger (not really) experience was worse than ever before when it was much easier to buy a ticket for a single ride. The next train was gone by now and after about 40 minutes utterly frustrated, I decided to skip my trip to SFO as I was in such a bad mood, nothing positive was to be expected.What I did not mention, this was the second time with a very similar experience, the first time I had to drive to Oakland airport to pick up my daughter instead of taking BART. Maybe I was just an outlier, but I need to make sure that there is a record of the overall miserable customer experience at this location. Don't think that BART is a viable alternative for people like myself using the (well trying to use) the transit system every now and them.I am a big fan of public transportation, if it works, like it does in other countries, but I do understand if people in the Bay Area consider it a waste of money subsidizing BART.Just close it down and provide free UBER or LYFT, probably cheaper and for sure more reliable."

Well, the card reader that did not have the ""out of order"" sticker did not cooperate. It was very persistent telling me please touch card again. So, it recognized there was a card - my phone with NFC - but it refused to let me into the station. After many attempts at all possible entrances, I pressed the ""help button"". The recommendation was to call Clipper, they are responsible :( I called and they told me, the Clipper App is not what I need, I need Google wallet to get in. Okay, I downloaded Google wallet and sure enough the Clipper card showed up with a $30 amount, isn't life wonderful :) Unfortunately the next train just left the station. Here we go, convinced the stupid Clipper system finally lets me in - WRONG - same message, please touch card again at all possible scanners I found. At the main entrance I found a lady from BART, explained my situation and what I tried, she apologized profoundly and recommended to buy a new plastic Clipper card, charging it with another amount to use it. Most of the Clipper machines where out of order and the one working did not offer a ""buy Clipper card"" option. She tried to use my phone as well to get in, no such luck. The whole user / customer / passenger (not really) experience was worse than ever before when it was much easier to buy a ticket for a single ride. The next train was gone by now and after about 40 minutes utterly frustrated, I decided to skip my trip to SFO as I was in such a bad mood, nothing positive was to be expected.What I did not mention, this was the second time with a very similar experience, the first time I had to drive to Oakland airport to pick up my daughter instead of taking BART. Maybe I was just an outlier, but I need to make sure that there is a record of the overall miserable customer experience at this location. Don't think that BART is a viable alternative for people like myself using the (well trying to use) the transit system every now and them.I am a big fan of public transportation, if it works, like it does in other countries, but I do understand if people in the Bay Area consider it a waste of money subsidizing BART.Just close it down and provide free UBER or LYFT, probably cheaper and for sure more reliable."
1,"Dec 12, 2022","It is so vile and disgusting being on the train. The train reeked of cigarettes and the next car reeked of pot. Homeless and their gear all over the place. Food and drink containers all over the floor in multiple cars. Food and candy on the ultra dirty seats, above a dirty sticky floor. Covid would be scared of this monstrosity, and leave the train. A ripped seat  on the floor. The foul smell bad body order.  Dirty clothes on the floor with no owner in sight.  Then a few people jump the exit without paying. BART should be disgusted with itself."

3,"Jun 9, 2022","I recently took BART for the first time since the 1970's when it opened to get from SFO to Berkeley. It was so efficient and I am so grateful that it exists. However, it was not the best experience people-wise and that is not so much a reflection of BART as it is of the times.A crack addict rode near me and scratched, genuflected and spewed some kind of dander all over the place while panhandlers sauntered about asking for handouts. An armed policeman walked through many minutes after this had all occurred. That is a 1-star review experience, my friends. The elevator and grounds were sketchy and kinda gross."

1,"Dec 13, 2022",BART lost my commuting ridership for two reasons:1) It's insulting and infuriating to me that basically every fifth person just jumps over the gates for free and no one cares. I'm paying full price and the free riders act like it's their right.2) The majority of the free riders are vagrant drug attics. The do their drugs in the train often smoking something that smell synthetic that eve permeates your mask. They leave their garbage in the train. A lot are also mentally unstable and make the train unsafe. Some may scoff but this is reality!I would propose that Bart does a pilot program to install New York like gates that go all the way up. Test this at a pilot station then install more. Until the two points I listed above are addressed I would rather pay more to park than ride Bart. It's sad because I know Bart has a budget deficit and decreased ridership. But the Bay Area needs Bart!

1,"Dec 1, 2022","I went to a concert at chase center and it took an hour of waiting for a train to The east bay. Crazy people on the train threatening people, strange homeless men walking around the station looking for trouble. Never ever take Bart home at night after 10:00"
1,"Dec 13, 2022",BART lost my commuting ridership for two reasons:1) It's insulting and infuriating to me that basically every fifth person just jumps over the gates for free and no one cares. I'm paying full price and the free riders act like it's their right.2) The majority of the free riders are vagrant drug attics. The do their drugs in the train often smoking something that smell synthetic that eve permeates your mask. They leave their garbage in the train. A lot are also mentally unstable and make the train unsafe. Some may scoff but this is reality!I would propose that Bart does a pilot program to install New York like gates that go all the way up. Test this at a pilot station then install more. Until the two points I listed above are addressed I would rather pay more to park than ride Bart. It's sad because I know Bart has a budget deficit and decreased ridership. But the Bay Area needs Bart!
1,"Jul 11, 2023","Don't I wish I could use public transportation but by all means, it doesn't work for me. The location in question - Berryessa San Jose. Once again, there are no Zeros or negative numbers in the Star options. The ""brief"" version:It took me almost 5 minutes to find a ticket machine for parking to pay, more out of orders than working ones, finally I made it - too bad I missed the first train. I have a Clipper account, charged with $30 (months ago), have the Clipper App downloaded and it confirms the $30 on the card, using an Android phone with NFC and I thought I am ready to go. Well, the card reader that did not have the ""out of order"" sticker did not cooperate. It was very persistent telling me please touch card again. So, it recognized there was a card - my phone with NFC - but it refused to let me into the station. After many attempts at all possible entrances, I pressed the ""help button"". The recommendation was to call Clipper, they are responsible :( I called and they told me, the Clipper App is not what I need, I need Google wallet to get in. Okay, I downloaded Google wallet and sure enough the Clipper card showed up with a $30 amount, isn't life wonderful :) Unfortunately the next train just left the station. Here we go, convinced the stupid Clipper system finally lets me in - WRONG - same message, please touch card again at all possible scanners I found. At the main entrance I found a lady from BART, explained my situation and what I tried, she apologized profoundly and recommended to buy a new plastic Clipper card, charging it with another amount to use it. Most of the Clipper machines where out of order and the one working did not offer a ""buy Clipper card"" option. She tried to use my phone as well to get in, no such luck. The whole user / customer / passenger (not really) experience was worse than ever before when it was much easier to buy a ticket for a single ride. The next train was gone by now and after about 40 minutes utterly frustrated, I decided to skip my trip to SFO as I was in such a bad mood, nothing positive was to be expected.What I did not mention, this was the second time with a very similar experience, the first time I had to drive to Oakland airport to pick up my daughter instead of taking BART. Maybe I was just an outlier, but I need to make sure that there is a record of the overall miserable customer experience at this location. Don't think that BART is a viable alternative for people like myself using the (well trying to use) the transit system every now and them.I am a big fan of public transportation, if it works, like it does in other countries, but I do understand if people in the Bay Area consider it a waste of money subsidizing BART.Just close it down and provide free UBER or LYFT, probably cheaper and for sure more reliable."
1,"Dec 12, 2022","It is so vile and disgusting being on the train. The train reeked of cigarettes and the next car reeked of pot. Homeless and their gear all over the place. Food and drink containers all over the floor in multiple cars. Food and candy on the ultra dirty seats, above a dirty sticky floor. Covid would be scared of this monstrosity, and leave the train. A ripped seat  on the floor. The foul smell bad body order.  Dirty clothes on the floor with no owner in sight.  Then a few people jump the exit without paying. BART should be disgusted with itself."

However, it was not the best experience people-wise and that is not so much a reflection of BART as it is of the times.A crack addict rode near me and scratched, genuflected and spewed some kind of dander all over the place while panhandlers sauntered about asking for handouts. An armed policeman walked through many minutes after this had all occurred. That is a 1-star review experience, my friends. The elevator and grounds were sketchy and kinda gross."

1,"Dec 12, 2022","It is so vile and disgusting being on the train. The train reeked of cigarettes and the next car reeked of pot. Homeless and their gear all over the place. Food and drink containers all over the floor in multiple cars. Food and candy on the ultra dirty seats, above a dirty sticky floor. Covid would be scared of this monstrosity, and leave the train. A ripped seat  on the floor. The foul smell bad body order.  Dirty clothes on the floor with no owner in sight.  Then a few people jump the exit without paying. BART should be disgusted with itself."

3,"Jun 9, 2022","I recently took BART for the first time since the 1970's when it opened to get from SFO to Berkeley. It was so efficient and I am so grateful that it exists. However, it was not the best experience people-wise and that is not so much a reflection of BART as it is of the times.A crack addict rode near me and scratched, genuflected and spewed some kind of dander all over the place while panhandlers sauntered about asking for handouts. An armed policeman walked through many minutes after this had all occurred. That is a 1-star review experience, my friends. The elevator and grounds were sketchy and kinda gross."

What the heck at least announce something we can hear so I don't have to watch every station at the end - pain since the boards never make it clear before boarding - almost seems random - nobody laughing and constantly people getting the wrong stop"

1,"Dec 13, 2022",BART lost my commuting ridership for two reasons:1) It's insulting and infuriating to me that basically every fifth person just jumps over the gates for free and no one cares. I'm paying full price and the free riders act like it's their right.2) The majority of the free riders are vagrant drug attics. The do their drugs in the train often smoking something that smell synthetic that eve permeates your mask. They leave their garbage in the train. A lot are also mentally unstable and make the train unsafe. Some may scoff but this is reality!I would propose that Bart does a pilot program to install New York like gates that go all the way up. Test this at a pilot station then install more. Until the two points I listed above are addressed I would rather pay more to park than ride Bart. It's sad because I know Bart has a budget deficit and decreased ridership. But the Bay Area needs Bart!
1,"Jul 11, 2023","Don't I wish I could use public transportation but by all means, it doesn't work for me. The location in question - Berryessa San Jose. Once again, there are no Zeros or negative numbers in the Star options. The ""brief"" version:It took me almost 5 minutes to find a ticket machine for parking to pay, more out of orders than working ones, finally I made it - too bad I missed the first train. I have a Clipper account, charged with $30 (months ago), have the Clipper App downloaded and it confirms the $30 on the card, using an Android phone with NFC and I thought I am ready to go. Well, the card reader that did not have the ""out of order"" sticker did not cooperate. It was very persistent telling me please touch card again. So, it recognized there was a card - my phone with NFC - but it refused to let me into the station. After many attempts at all possible entrances, I pressed the ""help button"". The recommendation was to call Clipper, they are responsible :( I called and they told me, the Clipper App is not what I need, I need Google wallet to get in. Okay, I downloaded Google wallet and sure enough the Clipper card showed up with a $30 amount, isn't life wonderful :) Unfortunately the next train just left the station. Here we go, convinced the stupid Clipper system finally lets me in - WRONG - same message, please touch card again at all possible scanners I found. At the main entrance I found a lady from BART, explained my situation and what I tried, she apologized profoundly and recommended to buy a new plastic Clipper card, charging it with another amount to use it. Most of the Clipper machines where out of order and the one working did not offer a ""buy Clipper card"" option. She tried to use my phone as well to get in, no such luck. The whole user / customer / passenger (not really) experience was worse than ever before when it was much easier to buy a ticket for a single ride.

1,"Jul 11, 2023","Don't I wish I could use public transportation but by all means, it doesn't work for me. The location in question - Berryessa San Jose. Once again, there are no Zeros or negative numbers in the Star options. The ""brief"" version:It took me almost 5 minutes to find a ticket machine for parking to pay, more out of orders than working ones, finally I made it - too bad I missed the first train. I have a Clipper account, charged with $30 (months ago), have the Clipper App downloaded and it confirms the $30 on the card, using an Android phone with NFC and I thought I am ready to go. Well, the card reader that did not have the ""out of order"" sticker did not cooperate. It was very persistent telling me please touch card again. So, it recognized there was a card - my phone with NFC - but it refused to let me into the station. After many attempts at all possible entrances, I pressed the ""help button"". The recommendation was to call Clipper, they are responsible :( I called and they told me, the Clipper App is not what I need, I need Google wallet to get in. Okay, I downloaded Google wallet and sure enough the Clipper card showed up with a $30 amount, isn't life wonderful :) Unfortunately the next train just left the station. Here we go, convinced the stupid Clipper system finally lets me in - WRONG - same message, please touch card again at all possible scanners I found. At the main entrance I found a lady from BART, explained my situation and what I tried, she apologized profoundly and recommended to buy a new plastic Clipper card, charging it with another amount to use it. Most of the Clipper machines where out of order and the one working did not offer a ""buy Clipper card"" option. She tried to use my phone as well to get in, no such luck. The whole user / customer / passenger (not really) experience was worse than ever before when it was much easier to buy a ticket for a single ride. The next train was gone by now and after about 40 minutes utterly frustrated, I decided to skip my trip to SFO as I was in such a bad mood, nothing positive was to be expected.What I did not mention, this was the second time with a very similar experience, the first time I had to drive to Oakland airport to pick up my daughter instead of taking BART. Maybe I was just an outlier, but I need to make sure that there is a record of the overall miserable customer experience at this location. Don't think that BART is a viable alternative for people like myself using the (well trying to use) the transit system every now and them.I am a big fan of public transportation, if it works, like it does in other countries, but I do understand if people in the Bay Area consider it a waste of money subsidizing BART.Just close it down and provide free UBER or LYFT, probably cheaper and for sure more reliable."
1,"Dec 12, 2022","It is so vile and disgusting being on the train. The train reeked of cigarettes and the next car reeked of pot. Homeless and their gear all over the place. Food and drink containers all over the floor in multiple cars. Food and candy on the ultra dirty seats, above a dirty sticky floor. Covid would be scared of this monstrosity, and leave the train. A ripped seat  on the floor. The foul smell bad body order.  Dirty clothes on the floor with no owner in sight.  Then a few people jump the exit without paying. BART should be disgusted with itself."

3,"Jun 9, 2022","I recently took BART for the first time since the 1970's when it opened to get from SFO to Berkeley. It was so efficient and I am so grateful that it exists. However, it was not the best experience people-wise and that is not so much a reflection of BART as it is of the times.A crack addict rode near me and scratched, genuflected and spewed some kind of dander all over the place while panhandlers sauntered about asking for handouts. An armed policeman walked through many minutes after this had all occurred. That is a 1-star review experience, my friends. The elevator and grounds were sketchy and kinda gross."

An armed policeman walked through many minutes after this had all occurred. That is a 1-star review experience, my friends. The elevator and grounds were sketchy and kinda gross."

1,"Dec 1, 2022","I went to a concert at chase center and it took an hour of waiting for a train to The east bay. Crazy people on the train threatening people, strange homeless men walking around the station looking for trouble. Never ever take Bart home at night after 10:00"
1,"Dec 13, 2022",BART lost my commuting ridership for two reasons:1) It's insulting and infuriating to me that basically every fifth person just jumps over the gates for free and no one cares. I'm paying full price and the free riders act like it's their right.2) The majority of the free riders are vagrant drug attics. The do their drugs in the train often smoking something that smell synthetic that eve permeates your mask. They leave their garbage in the train. A lot are also mentally unstable and make the train unsafe. Some may scoff but this is reality!I would propose that Bart does a pilot program to install New York like gates that go all the way up. Test this at a pilot station then install more. Until the two points I listed above are addressed I would rather pay more to park than ride Bart. It's sad because I know Bart has a budget deficit and decreased ridership. But the Bay Area needs Bart!
1,"Jul 11, 2023","Don't I wish I could use public transportation but by all means, it doesn't work for me. The location in question - Berryessa San Jose. Once again, there are no Zeros or negative numbers in the Star options. The ""brief"" version:It took me almost 5 minutes to find a ticket machine for parking to pay, more out of orders than working ones, finally I made it - too bad I missed the first train. I have a Clipper account, charged with $30 (months ago), have the Clipper App downloaded and it confirms the $30 on the card, using an Android phone with NFC and I thought I am ready to go. Well, the card reader that did not have the ""out of order"" sticker did not cooperate. It was very persistent telling me please touch card again. So, it recognized there was a card - my phone with NFC - but it refused to let me into the station. After many attempts at all possible entrances, I pressed the ""help button"". The recommendation was to call Clipper, they are responsible :( I called and they told me, the Clipper App is not what I need, I need Google wallet to get in. Okay, I downloaded Google wallet and sure enough the Clipper card showed up with a $30 amount, isn't life wonderful :) Unfortunately the next train just left the station. Here we go, convinced the stupid Clipper system finally lets me in - WRONG - same message, please touch card again at all possible scanners I found. At the main entrance I found a lady from BART, explained my situation and what I tried, she apologized profoundly and recommended to buy a new plastic Clipper card, charging it with another amount to use it. Most of the Clipper machines where out of order and the one working did not offer a ""buy Clipper card"" option. She tried to use my phone as well to get in, no such luck. The whole user / customer / passenger (not really) experience was worse than ever before when it was much easier to buy a ticket for a single ride. The next train was gone by now and after about 40 minutes utterly frustrated, I decided to skip my trip to SFO as I was in such a bad mood, nothing positive was to be expected.What I did not mention, this was the second time with a very similar experience, the first time I had to drive to Oakland airport to pick up my daughter instead of taking BART. Maybe I was just an outlier, but I need to make sure that there is a record of the overall miserable customer experience at this location. Don't think that BART is a viable alternative for people like myself using the (well trying to use) the transit system every now and them.I am a big fan of public transportation, if it works, like it does in other countries, but I do understand if people in the Bay Area consider it a waste of money subsidizing BART.Just close it down and provide free UBER or LYFT, probably cheaper and for sure more reliable."
1,"Dec 12, 2022","It is so vile and disgusting being on the train. The train reeked of cigarettes and the next car reeked of pot. Homeless and their gear all over the place. Food and drink containers all over the floor in multiple cars. Food and candy on the ultra dirty seats, above a dirty sticky floor. Covid would be scared of this monstrosity, and leave the train. A ripped seat  on the floor. The foul smell bad body order.  Dirty clothes on the floor with no owner in sight.  Then a few people jump the exit without paying. BART should be disgusted with itself."

At the main entrance I found a lady from BART, explained my situation and what I tried, she apologized profoundly and recommended to buy a new plastic Clipper card, charging it with another amount to use it. Most of the Clipper machines where out of order and the one working did not offer a ""buy Clipper card"" option. She tried to use my phone as well to get in, no such luck. The whole user / customer / passenger (not really) experience was worse than ever before when it was much easier to buy a ticket for a single ride. The next train was gone by now and after about 40 minutes utterly frustrated, I decided to skip my trip to SFO as I was in such a bad mood, nothing positive was to be expected.What I did not mention, this was the second time with a very similar experience, the first time I had to drive to Oakland airport to pick up my daughter instead of taking BART. Maybe I was just an outlier, but I need to make sure that there is a record of the overall miserable customer experience at this location. Don't think that BART is a viable alternative for people like myself using the (well trying to use) the transit system every now and them.I am a big fan of public transportation, if it works, like it does in other countries, but I do understand if people in the Bay Area consider it a waste of money subsidizing BART.Just close it down and provide free UBER or LYFT, probably cheaper and for sure more reliable."
1,"Dec 12, 2022","It is so vile and disgusting being on the train. The train reeked of cigarettes and the next car reeked of pot. Homeless and their gear all over the place. Food and drink containers all over the floor in multiple cars. Food and candy on the ultra dirty seats, above a dirty sticky floor. Covid would be scared of this monstrosity, and leave the train. A ripped seat  on the floor. The foul smell bad body order.  Dirty clothes on the floor with no owner in sight.  Then a few people jump the exit without paying. BART should be disgusted with itself."

3,"Jun 9, 2022","I recently took BART for the first time since the 1970's when it opened to get from SFO to Berkeley. It was so efficient and I am so grateful that it exists. However, it was not the best experience people-wise and that is not so much a reflection of BART as it is of the times.A crack addict rode near me and scratched, genuflected and spewed some kind of dander all over the place while panhandlers sauntered about asking for handouts. An armed policeman walked through many minutes after this had all occurred. That is a 1-star review experience, my friends. The elevator and grounds were sketchy and kinda gross."

1,"Dec 13, 2022",BART lost my commuting ridership for two reasons:1) It's insulting and infuriating to me that basically every fifth person just jumps over the gates for free and no one cares. I'm paying full price and the free riders act like it's their right.2) The majority of the free riders are vagrant drug attics. The do their drugs in the train often smoking something that smell synthetic that eve permeates your mask. They leave their garbage in the train. A lot are also mentally unstable and make the train unsafe. Some may scoff but this is reality!I would propose that Bart does a pilot program to install New York like gates that go all the way up. Test this at a pilot station then install more. Until the two points I listed above are addressed I would rather pay more to park than ride Bart. It's sad because I know Bart has a budget deficit and decreased ridership. But the Bay Area needs Bart!

1,"Dec 1, 2022","I went to a concert at chase center and it took an hour of waiting for a train to The east bay. Crazy people on the train threatening people, strange homeless men walking around the station looking for trouble. Never ever take Bart home at night after 10:00"
1,"Dec 13, 2022",BART lost my commuting ridership for two reasons:1) It's insulting and infuriating to me that basically every fifth person just jumps over the gates for free and no one cares. I'm paying full price and the free riders act like it's their right.2) The majority of the free riders are vagrant drug attics. The do their drugs in the train often smoking something that smell synthetic that eve permeates your mask. They leave their garbage in the train. A lot are also mentally unstable and make the train unsafe. Some may scoff but this is reality!I would propose that Bart does a pilot program to install New York like gates that go all the way up. Test this at a pilot station then install more. Until the two points I listed above are addressed I would rather pay more to park than ride Bart. It's sad because I know Bart has a budget deficit and decreased ridership. But the Bay Area needs Bart!
1,"Jul 11, 2023","Don't I wish I could use public transportation but by all means, it doesn't work for me. The location in question - Berryessa San Jose. Once again, there are no Zeros or negative numbers in the Star options. The ""brief"" version:It took me almost 5 minutes to find a ticket machine for parking to pay, more out of orders than working ones, finally I made it - too bad I missed the first train. I have a Clipper account, charged with $30 (months ago), have the Clipper App downloaded and it confirms the $30 on the card, using an Android phone with NFC and I thought I am ready to go. Well, the card reader that did not have the ""out of order"" sticker did not cooperate. It was very persistent telling me please touch card again. So, it recognized there was a card - my phone with NFC - but it refused to let me into the station. After many attempts at all possible entrances, I pressed the ""help button"". The recommendation was to call Clipper, they are responsible :( I called and they told me, the Clipper App is not what I need, I need Google wallet to get in. Okay, I downloaded Google wallet and sure enough the Clipper card showed up with a $30 amount, isn't life wonderful :) Unfortunately the next train just left the station. Here we go, convinced the stupid Clipper system finally lets me in - WRONG - same message, please touch card again at all possible scanners I found. At the main entrance I found a lady from BART, explained my situation and what I tried, she apologized profoundly and recommended to buy a new plastic Clipper card, charging it with another amount to use it. Most of the Clipper machines where out of order and the one working did not offer a ""buy Clipper card"" option. She tried to use my phone as well to get in, no such luck. The whole user / customer / passenger (not really) experience was worse than ever before when it was much easier to buy a ticket for a single ride. The next train was gone by now and after about 40 minutes utterly frustrated, I decided to skip my trip to SFO as I was in such a bad mood, nothing positive was to be expected.What I did not mention, this was the second time with a very similar experience, the first time I had to drive to Oakland airport to pick up my daughter instead of taking BART. Maybe I was just an outlier, but I need to make sure that there is a record of the overall miserable customer experience at this location. Don't think that BART is a viable alternative for people like myself using the (well trying to use) the transit system every now and them.I am a big fan of public transportation, if it works, like it does in other countries, but I do understand if people in the Bay Area consider it a waste of money subsidizing BART.Just close it down and provide free UBER or LYFT, probably cheaper and for sure more reliable."
1,"Dec 12, 2022","It is so vile and disgusting being on the train. The train reeked of cigarettes and the next car reeked of pot. Homeless and their gear all over the place. Food and drink containers all over the floor in multiple cars. Food and candy on the ultra dirty seats, above a dirty sticky floor. Covid would be scared of this monstrosity, and leave the train. A ripped seat  on the floor. The foul smell bad body order.  Dirty clothes on the floor with no owner in sight.  Then a few people jump the exit without paying. BART should be disgusted with itself."

3,"Jun 9, 2022","I recently took BART for the first time since the 1970's when it opened to get from SFO to Berkeley. It was so efficient and I am so grateful that it exists. However, it was not the best experience people-wise and that is not so much a reflection of BART as it is of the times.A crack addict rode near me and scratched, genuflected and spewed some kind of dander all over the place while panhandlers sauntered about asking for handouts. An armed policeman walked through many minutes after this had all occurred. That is a 1-star review experience, my friends. The elevator and grounds were sketchy and kinda gross."
3,"Jan 18, 2023","Took the train to the Oakland Airport from North Concord on a Sunday.Ride was good until I transferred to the Coliseum. Glad I don't do this often.I did take BART back home two weeks later.  It wasn't any better, but on a positive note, the senior clipper pass is a good deal!"
3,"Oct 11, 2022","Why on earth are the announcements so soft? Who are you talking to? Nobody can hear a thing above the noise.

What the heck at least announce something we can hear so I don't have to watch every station at the end - pain since the boards never make it clear before boarding - almost seems random - nobody laughing and constantly people getting the wrong stop"

3,"Jun 9, 2022","I recently took BART for the first time since the 1970's when it opened to get from SFO to Berkeley. It was so efficient and I am so grateful that it exists.

An armed policeman walked through many minutes after this had all occurred. That is a 1-star review experience, my friends. The elevator and grounds were sketchy and kinda gross."

1,"Dec 13, 2022",BART lost my commuting ridership for two reasons:1) It's insulting and infuriating to me that basically every fifth person just jumps over the gates for free and no one cares. I'm paying full price and the free riders act like it's their right.2) The majority of the free riders are vagrant drug attics. The do their drugs in the train often smoking something that smell synthetic that eve permeates your mask. They leave their garbage in the train. A lot are also mentally unstable and make the train unsafe. Some may scoff but this is reality!I would propose that Bart does a pilot program to install New York like gates that go all the way up. Test this at a pilot station then install more. Until the two points I listed above are addressed I would rather pay more to park than ride Bart. It's sad because I know Bart has a budget deficit and decreased ridership. But the Bay Area needs Bart!
1,"Jul 11, 2023","Don't I wish I could use public transportation but by all means, it doesn't work for me. The location in question - Berryessa San Jose. Once again, there are no Zeros or negative numbers in the Star options. The ""brief"" version:It took me almost 5 minutes to find a ticket machine for parking to pay, more out of orders than working ones, finally I made it - too bad I missed the first train. I have a Clipper account, charged with $30 (months ago), have the Clipper App downloaded and it confirms the $30 on the card, using an Android phone with NFC and I thought I am ready to go. Well, the card reader that did not have the ""out of order"" sticker did not cooperate. It was very persistent telling me please touch card again. So, it recognized there was a card - my phone with NFC - but it refused to let me into the station. After many attempts at all possible entrances, I pressed the ""help button"". The recommendation was to call Clipper, they are responsible :( I called and they told me, the Clipper App is not what I need, I need Google wallet to get in. Okay, I downloaded Google wallet and sure enough the Clipper card showed up with a $30 amount, isn't life wonderful :) Unfortunately the next train just left the station. Here we go, convinced the stupid Clipper system finally lets me in - WRONG - same message, please touch card again at all possible scanners I found. At the main entrance I found a lady from BART, explained my situation and what I tried, she apologized profoundly and recommended to buy a new plastic Clipper card, charging it with another amount to use it. Most of the Clipper machines where out of order and the one working did not offer a ""buy Clipper card"" option. She tried to use my phone as well to get in, no such luck. The whole user / customer / passenger (not really) experience was worse than ever before when it was much easier to buy a ticket for a single ride. The next train was gone by now and after about 40 minutes utterly frustrated, I decided to skip my trip to SFO as I was in such a bad mood, nothing positive was to be expected.What I did not mention, this was the second time with a very similar experience, the first time I had to drive to Oakland airport to pick up my daughter instead of taking BART. Maybe I was just an outlier, but I need to make sure that there is a record of the overall miserable customer experience at this location. Don't think that BART is a viable alternative for people like myself using the (well trying to use) the transit system every now and them.I am a big fan of public transportation, if it works, like it does in other countries, but I do understand if people in the Bay Area consider it a waste of money subsidizing BART.Just close it down and provide free UBER or LYFT, probably cheaper and for sure more reliable."

Well, the card reader that did not have the ""out of order"" sticker did not cooperate. It was very persistent telling me please touch card again. So, it recognized there was a card - my phone with NFC - but it refused to let me into the station. After many attempts at all possible entrances, I pressed the ""help button"". The recommendation was to call Clipper, they are responsible :( I called and they told me, the Clipper App is not what I need, I need Google wallet to get in. Okay, I downloaded Google wallet and sure enough the Clipper card showed up with a $30 amount, isn't life wonderful :) Unfortunately the next train just left the station. Here we go, convinced the stupid Clipper system finally lets me in - WRONG - same message, please touch card again at all possible scanners I found. At the main entrance I found a lady from BART, explained my situation and what I tried, she apologized profoundly and recommended to buy a new plastic Clipper card, charging it with another amount to use it. Most of the Clipper machines where out of order and the one working did not offer a ""buy Clipper card"" option. She tried to use my phone as well to get in, no such luck. The whole user / customer / passenger (not really) experience was worse than ever before when it was much easier to buy a ticket for a single ride. The next train was gone by now and after about 40 minutes utterly frustrated, I decided to skip my trip to SFO as I was in such a bad mood, nothing positive was to be expected.What I did not mention, this was the second time with a very similar experience, the first time I had to drive to Oakland airport to pick up my daughter instead of taking BART. Maybe I was just an outlier, but I need to make sure that there is a record of the overall miserable customer experience at this location. Don't think that BART is a viable alternative for people like myself using the (well trying to use) the transit system every now and them.I am a big fan of public transportation, if it works, like it does in other countries, but I do understand if people in the Bay Area consider it a waste of money subsidizing BART.Just close it down and provide free UBER or LYFT, probably cheaper and for sure more reliable."
1,"Dec 12, 2022","It is so vile and disgusting being on the train. The train reeked of cigarettes and the next car reeked of pot. Homeless and their gear all over the place. Food and drink containers all over the floor in multiple cars. Food and candy on the ultra dirty seats, above a dirty sticky floor. Covid would be scared of this monstrosity, and leave the train. A ripped seat  on the floor. The foul smell bad body order.  Dirty clothes on the floor with no owner in sight.  Then a few people jump the exit without paying. BART should be disgusted with itself."

3,"Jun 9, 2022","I recently took BART for the first time since the 1970's when it opened to get from SFO to Berkeley. It was so efficient and I am so grateful that it exists. However, it was not the best experience people-wise and that is not so much a reflection of BART as it is of the times.A crack addict rode near me and scratched, genuflected and spewed some kind of dander all over the place while panhandlers sauntered about asking for handouts. An armed policeman walked through many minutes after this had all occurred. That is a 1-star review experience, my friends. The elevator and grounds were sketchy and kinda gross."

1,"Dec 13, 2022",BART lost my commuting ridership for two reasons:1) It's insulting and infuriating to me that basically every fifth person just jumps over the gates for free and no one cares. I'm paying full price and the free riders act like it's their right.2) The majority of the free riders are vagrant drug attics. The do their drugs in the train often smoking something that smell synthetic that eve permeates your mask. They leave their garbage in the train. A lot are also mentally unstable and make the train unsafe. Some may scoff but this is reality!I would propose that Bart does a pilot program to install New York like gates that go all the way up. Test this at a pilot station then install more. Until the two points I listed above are addressed I would rather pay more to park than ride Bart. It's sad because I know Bart has a budget deficit and decreased ridership. But the Bay Area needs Bart!

1,"Dec 1, 2022","I went to a concert at chase center and it took an hour of waiting for a train to The east bay. Crazy people on the train threatening people, strange homeless men walking around the station looking for trouble. Never ever take Bart home at night after 10:00"
1,"Dec 13, 2022",BART lost my commuting ridership for two reasons:1) It's insulting and infuriating to me that basically every fifth person just jumps over the gates for free and no one cares. I'm paying full price and the free riders act like it's their right.2) The majority of the free riders are vagrant drug attics. The do their drugs in the train often smoking something that smell synthetic that eve permeates your mask. They leave their garbage in the train. A lot are also mentally unstable and make the train unsafe. Some may scoff but this is reality!I would propose that Bart does a pilot program to install New York like gates that go all the way up. Test this at a pilot station then install more. Until the two points I listed above are addressed I would rather pay more to park than ride Bart. It's sad because I know Bart has a budget deficit and decreased ridership. But the Bay Area needs Bart!
1,"Jul 11, 2023","Don't I wish I could use public transportation but by all means, it doesn't work for me. The location in question - Berryessa San Jose. Once again, there are no Zeros or negative numbers in the Star options. The ""brief"" version:It took me almost 5 minutes to find a ticket machine for parking to pay, more out of orders than working ones, finally I made it - too bad I missed the first train. I have a Clipper account, charged with $30 (months ago), have the Clipper App downloaded and it confirms the $30 on the card, using an Android phone with NFC and I thought I am ready to go. Well, the card reader that did not have the ""out of order"" sticker did not cooperate. It was very persistent telling me please touch card again. So, it recognized there was a card - my phone with NFC - but it refused to let me into the station. After many attempts at all possible entrances, I pressed the ""help button"". The recommendation was to call Clipper, they are responsible :( I called and they told me, the Clipper App is not what I need, I need Google wallet to get in. Okay, I downloaded Google wallet and sure enough the Clipper card showed up with a $30 amount, isn't life wonderful :) Unfortunately the next train just left the station. Here we go, convinced the stupid Clipper system finally lets me in - WRONG - same message, please touch card again at all possible scanners I found. At the main entrance I found a lady from BART, explained my situation and what I tried, she apologized profoundly and recommended to buy a new plastic Clipper card, charging it with another amount to use it. Most of the Clipper machines where out of order and the one working did not offer a ""buy Clipper card"" option. She tried to use my phone as well to get in, no such luck. The whole user / customer / passenger (not really) experience was worse than ever before when it was much easier to buy a ticket for a single ride. The next train was gone by now and after about 40 minutes utterly frustrated, I decided to skip my trip to SFO as I was in such a bad mood, nothing positive was to be expected.What I did not mention, this was the second time with a very similar experience, the first time I had to drive to Oakland airport to pick up my daughter instead of taking BART. Maybe I was just an outlier, but I need to make sure that there is a record of the overall miserable customer experience at this location. Don't think that BART is a viable alternative for people like myself using the (well trying to use) the transit system every now and them.I am a big fan of public transportation, if it works, like it does in other countries, but I do understand if people in the Bay Area consider it a waste of money subsidizing BART.Just close it down and provide free UBER or LYFT, probably cheaper and for sure more reliable."
1,"Dec 12, 2022","It is so vile and disgusting being on the train. The train reeked of cigarettes and the next car reeked of pot. Homeless and their gear all over the place. Food and drink containers all over the floor in multiple cars. Food and candy on the ultra dirty seats, above a dirty sticky floor. Covid would be scared of this monstrosity, and leave the train. A ripped seat  on the floor. The foul smell bad body order.  Dirty clothes on the floor with no owner in sight.  Then a few people jump the exit without paying. BART should be disgusted with itself."

However, it was not the best experience people-wise and that is not so much a reflection of BART as it is of the times.A crack addict rode near me and scratched, genuflected and spewed some kind of dander all over the place while panhandlers sauntered about asking for handouts. An armed policeman walked through many minutes after this had all occurred. That is a 1-star review experience, my friends. The elevator and grounds were sketchy and kinda gross."

1,"Dec 12, 2022","It is so vile and disgusting being on the train. The train reeked of cigarettes and the next car reeked of pot. Homeless and their gear all over the place. Food and drink containers all over the floor in multiple cars. Food and candy on the ultra dirty seats, above a dirty sticky floor. Covid would be scared of this monstrosity, and leave the train. A ripped seat  on the floor. The foul smell bad body order.  Dirty clothes on the floor with no owner in sight.  Then a few people jump the exit without paying. BART should be disgusted with itself."

3,"Jun 9, 2022","I recently took BART for the first time since the 1970's when it opened to get from SFO to Berkeley. It was so efficient and I am so grateful that it exists. However, it was not the best experience people-wise and that is not so much a reflection of BART as it is of the times.A crack addict rode near me and scratched, genuflected and spewed some kind of dander all over the place while panhandlers sauntered about asking for handouts. An armed policeman walked through many minutes after this had all occurred. That is a 1-star review experience, my friends. The elevator and grounds were sketchy and kinda gross."

What the heck at least announce something we can hear so I don't have to watch every station at the end - pain since the boards never make it clear before boarding - almost seems random - nobody laughing and constantly people getting the wrong stop"

1,"Dec 13, 2022",BART lost my commuting ridership for two reasons:1) It's insulting and infuriating to me that basically every fifth person just jumps over the gates for free and no one cares. I'm paying full price and the free riders act like it's their right.2) The majority of the free riders are vagrant drug attics. The do their drugs in the train often smoking something that smell synthetic that eve permeates your mask. They leave their garbage in the train. A lot are also mentally unstable and make the train unsafe. Some may scoff but this is reality!I would propose that Bart does a pilot program to install New York like gates that go all the way up. Test this at a pilot station then install more. Until the two points I listed above are addressed I would rather pay more to park than ride Bart. It's sad because I know Bart has a budget deficit and decreased ridership. But the Bay Area needs Bart!
1,"Jul 11, 2023","Don't I wish I could use public transportation but by all means, it doesn't work for me. The location in question - Berryessa San Jose. Once again, there are no Zeros or negative numbers in the Star options. The ""brief"" version:It took me almost 5 minutes to find a ticket machine for parking to pay, more out of orders than working ones, finally I made it - too bad I missed the first train. I have a Clipper account, charged with $30 (months ago), have the Clipper App downloaded and it confirms the $30 on the card, using an Android phone with NFC and I thought I am ready to go. Well, the card reader that did not have the ""out of order"" sticker did not cooperate. It was very persistent telling me please touch card again. So, it recognized there was a card - my phone with NFC - but it refused to let me into the station. After many attempts at all possible entrances, I pressed the ""help button"". The recommendation was to call Clipper, they are responsible :( I called and they told me, the Clipper App is not what I need, I need Google wallet to get in. Okay, I downloaded Google wallet and sure enough the Clipper card showed up with a $30 amount, isn't life wonderful :) Unfortunately the next train just left the station. Here we go, convinced the stupid Clipper system finally lets me in - WRONG - same message, please touch card again at all possible scanners I found. At the main entrance I found a lady from BART, explained my situation and what I tried, she apologized profoundly and recommended to buy a new plastic Clipper card, charging it with another amount to use it. Most of the Clipper machines where out of order and the one working did not offer a ""buy Clipper card"" option. She tried to use my phone as well to get in, no such luck. The whole user / customer / passenger (not really) experience was worse than ever before when it was much easier to buy a ticket for a single ride.

1,"Jul 11, 2023","Don't I wish I could use public transportation but by all means, it doesn't work for me. The location in question - Berryessa San Jose. Once again, there are no Zeros or negative numbers in the Star options. The ""brief"" version:It took me almost 5 minutes to find a ticket machine for parking to pay, more out of orders than working ones, finally I made it - too bad I missed the first train. I have a Clipper account, charged with $30 (months ago), have the Clipper App downloaded and it confirms the $30 on the card, using an Android phone with NFC and I thought I am ready to go. Well, the card reader that did not have the ""out of order"" sticker did not cooperate. It was very persistent telling me please touch card again. So, it recognized there was a card - my phone with NFC - but it refused to let me into the station. After many attempts at all possible entrances, I pressed the ""help button"". The recommendation was to call Clipper, they are responsible :( I called and they told me, the Clipper App is not what I need, I need Google wallet to get in. Okay, I downloaded Google wallet and sure enough the Clipper card showed up with a $30 amount, isn't life wonderful :) Unfortunately the next train just left the station. Here we go, convinced the stupid Clipper system finally lets me in - WRONG - same message, please touch card again at all possible scanners I found. At the main entrance I found a lady from BART, explained my situation and what I tried, she apologized profoundly and recommended to buy a new plastic Clipper card, charging it with another amount to use it. Most of the Clipper machines where out of order and the one working did not offer a ""buy Clipper card"" option. She tried to use my phone as well to get in, no such luck. The whole user / customer / passenger (not really) experience was worse than ever before when it was much easier to buy a ticket for a single ride. The next train was gone by now and after about 40 minutes utterly frustrated, I decided to skip my trip to SFO as I was in such a bad mood, nothing positive was to be expected.What I did not mention, this was the second time with a very similar experience, the first time I had to drive to Oakland airport to pick up my daughter instead of taking BART. Maybe I was just an outlier, but I need to make sure that there is a record of the overall miserable customer experience at this location. Don't think that BART is a viable alternative for people like myself using the (well trying to use) the transit system every now and them.I am a big fan of public transportation, if it works, like it does in other countries, but I do understand if people in the Bay Area consider it a waste of money subsidizing BART.Just close it down and provide free UBER or LYFT, probably cheaper and for sure more reliable."
1,"Dec 12, 2022","It is so vile and disgusting being on the train. The train reeked of cigarettes and the next car reeked of pot. Homeless and their gear all over the place. Food and drink containers all over the floor in multiple cars. Food and candy on the ultra dirty seats, above a dirty sticky floor. Covid would be scared of this monstrosity, and leave the train. A ripped seat  on the floor. The foul smell bad body order.  Dirty clothes on the floor with no owner in sight.  Then a few people jump the exit without paying. BART should be disgusted with itself."

3,"Jun 9, 2022","I recently took BART for the first time since the 1970's when it opened to get from SFO to Berkeley. It was so efficient and I am so grateful that it exists. However, it was not the best experience people-wise and that is not so much a reflection of BART as it is of the times.A crack addict rode near me and scratched, genuflected and spewed some kind of dander all over the place while panhandlers sauntered about asking for handouts. An armed policeman walked through many minutes after this had all occurred. That is a 1-star review experience, my friends. The elevator and grounds were sketchy and kinda gross."

An armed policeman walked through many minutes after this had all occurred. That is a 1-star review experience, my friends. The elevator and grounds were sketchy and kinda gross."

1,"Dec 1, 2022","I went to a concert at chase center and it took an hour of waiting for a train to The east bay. Crazy people on the train threatening people, strange homeless men walking around the station looking for trouble. Never ever take Bart home at night after 10:00"
1,"Dec 13, 2022",BART lost my commuting ridership for two reasons:1) It's insulting and infuriating to me that basically every fifth person just jumps over the gates for free and no one cares. I'm paying full price and the free riders act like it's their right.2) The majority of the free riders are vagrant drug attics. The do their drugs in the train often smoking something that smell synthetic that eve permeates your mask. They leave their garbage in the train. A lot are also mentally unstable and make the train unsafe. Some may scoff but this is reality!I would propose that Bart does a pilot program to install New York like gates that go all the way up. Test this at a pilot station then install more. Until the two points I listed above are addressed I would rather pay more to park than ride Bart. It's sad because I know Bart has a budget deficit and decreased ridership. But the Bay Area needs Bart!
1,"Jul 11, 2023","Don't I wish I could use public transportation but by all means, it doesn't work for me. The location in question - Berryessa San Jose. Once again, there are no Zeros or negative numbers in the Star options. The ""brief"" version:It took me almost 5 minutes to find a ticket machine for parking to pay, more out of orders than working ones, finally I made it - too bad I missed the first train. I have a Clipper account, charged with $30 (months ago), have the Clipper App downloaded and it confirms the $30 on the card, using an Android phone with NFC and I thought I am ready to go. Well, the card reader that did not have the ""out of order"" sticker did not cooperate. It was very persistent telling me please touch card again. So, it recognized there was a card - my phone with NFC - but it refused to let me into the station. After many attempts at all possible entrances, I pressed the ""help button"". The recommendation was to call Clipper, they are responsible :( I called and they told me, the Clipper App is not what I need, I need Google wallet to get in. Okay, I downloaded Google wallet and sure enough the Clipper card showed up with a $30 amount, isn't life wonderful :) Unfortunately the next train just left the station. Here we go, convinced the stupid Clipper system finally lets me in - WRONG - same message, please touch card again at all possible scanners I found. At the main entrance I found a lady from BART, explained my situation and what I tried, she apologized profoundly and recommended to buy a new plastic Clipper card, charging it with another amount to use it. Most of the Clipper machines where out of order and the one working did not offer a ""buy Clipper card"" option. She tried to use my phone as well to get in, no such luck. The whole user / customer / passenger (not really) experience was worse than ever before when it was much easier to buy a ticket for a single ride. The next train was gone by now and after about 40 minutes utterly frustrated, I decided to skip my trip to SFO as I was in such a bad mood, nothing positive was to be expected.What I did not mention, this was the second time with a very similar experience, the first time I had to drive to Oakland airport to pick up my daughter instead of taking BART. Maybe I was just an outlier, but I need to make sure that there is a record of the overall miserable customer experience at this location. Don't think that BART is a viable alternative for people like myself using the (well trying to use) the transit system every now and them.I am a big fan of public transportation, if it works, like it does in other countries, but I do understand if people in the Bay Area consider it a waste of money subsidizing BART.Just close it down and provide free UBER or LYFT, probably cheaper and for sure more reliable."
1,"Dec 12, 2022","It is so vile and disgusting being on the train. The train reeked of cigarettes and the next car reeked of pot. Homeless and their gear all over the place. Food and drink containers all over the floor in multiple cars. Food and candy on the ultra dirty seats, above a dirty sticky floor. Covid would be scared of this monstrosity, and leave the train. A ripped seat  on the floor. The foul smell bad body order.  Dirty clothes on the floor with no owner in sight.  Then a few people jump the exit without paying. BART should be disgusted with itself."

At the main entrance I found a lady from BART, explained my situation and what I tried, she apologized profoundly and recommended to buy a new plastic Clipper card, charging it with another amount to use it. Most of the Clipper machines where out of order and the one working did not offer a ""buy Clipper card"" option. She tried to use my phone as well to get in, no such luck. The whole user / customer / passenger (not really) experience was worse than ever before when it was much easier to buy a ticket for a single ride. The next train was gone by now and after about 40 minutes utterly frustrated, I decided to skip my trip to SFO as I was in such a bad mood, nothing positive was to be expected.What I did not mention, this was the second time with a very similar experience, the first time I had to drive to Oakland airport to pick up my daughter instead of taking BART. Maybe I was just an outlier, but I need to make sure that there is a record of the overall miserable customer experience at this location. Don't think that BART is a viable alternative for people like myself using the (well trying to use) the transit system every now and them.I am a big fan of public transportation, if it works, like it does in other countries, but I do understand if people in the Bay Area consider it a waste of money subsidizing BART.Just close it down and provide free UBER or LYFT, probably cheaper and for sure more reliable."
1,"Dec 12, 2022","It is so vile and disgusting being on the train. The train reeked of cigarettes and the next car reeked of pot. Homeless and their gear all over the place. Food and drink containers all over the floor in multiple cars. Food and candy on the ultra dirty seats, above a dirty sticky floor. Covid would be scared of this monstrosity, and leave the train. A ripped seat  on the floor. The foul smell bad body order.  Dirty clothes on the floor with no owner in sight.  Then a few people jump the exit without paying. BART should be disgusted with itself."

3,"Jun 9, 2022","I recently took BART for the first time since the 1970's when it opened to get from SFO to Berkeley. It was so efficient and I am so grateful that it exists. However, it was not the best experience people-wise and that is not so much a reflection of BART as it is of the times.A crack addict rode near me and scratched, genuflected and spewed some kind of dander all over the place while panhandlers sauntered about asking for handouts. An armed policeman walked through many minutes after this had all occurred. That is a 1-star review experience, my friends. The elevator and grounds were sketchy and kinda gross."

1,"Dec 13, 2022",BART lost my commuting ridership for two reasons:1) It's insulting and infuriating to me that basically every fifth person just jumps over the gates for free and no one cares. I'm paying full price and the free riders act like it's their right.2) The majority of the free riders are vagrant drug attics. The do their drugs in the train often smoking something that smell synthetic that eve permeates your mask. They leave their garbage in the train. A lot are also mentally unstable and make the train unsafe. Some may scoff but this is reality!I would propose that Bart does a pilot program to install New York like gates that go all the way up. Test this at a pilot station then install more. Until the two points I listed above are addressed I would rather pay more to park than ride Bart. It's sad because I know Bart has a budget deficit and decreased ridership. But the Bay Area needs Bart!

1,"Dec 1, 2022","I went to a concert at chase center and it took an hour of waiting for a train to The east bay. Crazy people on the train threatening people, strange homeless men walking around the station looking for trouble. Never ever take Bart home at night after 10:00"
1,"Dec 13, 2022",BART lost my commuting ridership for two reasons:1) It's insulting and infuriating to me that basically every fifth person just jumps over the gates for free and no one cares. I'm paying full price and the free riders act like it's their right.2) The majority of the free riders are vagrant drug attics. The do their drugs in the train often smoking something that smell synthetic that eve permeates your mask. They leave their garbage in the train. A lot are also mentally unstable and make the train unsafe. Some may scoff but this is reality!I would propose that Bart does a pilot program to install New York like gates that go all the way up. Test this at a pilot station then install more. Until the two points I listed above are addressed I would rather pay more to park than ride Bart. It's sad because I know Bart has a budget deficit and decreased ridership. But the Bay Area needs Bart!
1,"Jul 11, 2023","Don't I wish I could use public transportation but by all means, it doesn't work for me. The location in question - Berryessa San Jose. Once again, there are no Zeros or negative numbers in the Star options. The ""brief"" version:It took me almost 5 minutes to find a ticket machine for parking to pay, more out of orders than working ones, finally I made it - too bad I missed the first train. I have a Clipper account, charged with $30 (months ago), have the Clipper App downloaded and it confirms the $30 on the card, using an Android phone with NFC and I thought I am ready to go. Well, the card reader that did not have the ""out of order"" sticker did not cooperate. It was very persistent telling me please touch card again. So, it recognized there was a card - my phone with NFC - but it refused to let me into the station. After many attempts at all possible entrances, I pressed the ""help button"". The recommendation was to call Clipper, they are responsible :( I called and they told me, the Clipper App is not what I need, I need Google wallet to get in. Okay, I downloaded Google wallet and sure enough the Clipper card showed up with a $30 amount, isn't life wonderful :) Unfortunately the next train just left the station. Here we go, convinced the stupid Clipper system finally lets me in - WRONG - same message, please touch card again at all possible scanners I found. At the main entrance I found a lady from BART, explained my situation and what I tried, she apologized profoundly and recommended to buy a new plastic Clipper card, charging it with another amount to use it. Most of the Clipper machines where out of order and the one working did not offer a ""buy Clipper card"" option. She tried to use my phone as well to get in, no such luck. The whole user / customer / passenger (not really) experience was worse than ever before when it was much easier to buy a ticket for a single ride. The next train was gone by now and after about 40 minutes utterly frustrated, I decided to skip my trip to SFO as I was in such a bad mood, nothing positive was to be expected.What I did not mention, this was the second time with a very similar experience, the first time I had to drive to Oakland airport to pick up my daughter instead of taking BART. Maybe I was just an outlier, but I need to make sure that there is a record of the overall miserable customer experience at this location. Don't think that BART is a viable alternative for people like myself using the (well trying to use) the transit system every now and them.I am a big fan of public transportation, if it works, like it does in other countries, but I do understand if people in the Bay Area consider it a waste of money subsidizing BART.Just close it down and provide free UBER or LYFT, probably cheaper and for sure more reliable."
1,"Dec 12, 2022","It is so vile and disgusting being on the train. The train reeked of cigarettes and the next car reeked of pot. Homeless and their gear all over the place. Food and drink containers all over the floor in multiple cars. Food and candy on the ultra dirty seats, above a dirty sticky floor. Covid would be scared of this monstrosity, and leave the train. A ripped seat  on the floor. The foul smell bad body order.  Dirty clothes on the floor with no owner in sight.  Then a few people jump the exit without paying. BART should be disgusted with itself."

3,"Jun 9, 2022","I recently took BART for the first time since the 1970's when it opened to get from SFO to Berkeley. It was so efficient and I am so grateful that it exists. However, it was not the best experience people-wise and that is not so much a reflection of BART as it is of the times.A crack addict rode near me and scratched, genuflected and spewed some kind of dander all over the place while panhandlers sauntered about asking for handouts. An armed policeman walked through many minutes after this had all occurred. That is a 1-star review experience, my friends. The elevator and grounds were sketchy and kinda gross."
3,"Jan 18, 2023","Took the train to the Oakland Airport from North Concord on a Sunday.Ride was good until I transferred to the Coliseum. Glad I don't do this often.I did take BART back home two weeks later.  It wasn't any better, but on a positive note, the senior clipper pass is a good deal!"
3,"Oct 11, 2022","Why on earth are the announcements so soft? Who are you talking to? Nobody can hear a thing above the noise.

What the heck at least announce something we can hear so I don't have to watch every station at the end - pain since the boards never make it clear before boarding - almost seems random - nobody laughing and constantly people getting the wrong stop"

3,"Jun 9, 2022","I recently took BART for the first time since the 1970's when it opened to get from SFO to Berkeley. It was so efficient and I am so grateful that it exists. However, it was not the best experience people-wise and that is not so much a reflection of BART as it is of the times.A crack addict rode near me and scratched, genuflected and spewed some kind of dander all over the place while panhandlers sauntered about asking for handouts. An armed policeman walked through many minutes after this had all occurred. That is a 1-star review experience, my friends. The elevator and grounds were sketchy and kinda gross."

1,"Dec 1, 2022","I went to a concert at chase center and it took an hour of waiting for a train to The east bay. Crazy people on the train threatening people, strange homeless men walking around the station looking for trouble. Never ever take Bart home at night after 10:00"
1,"Dec 13, 2022",BART lost my commuting ridership for two reasons:1) It's insulting and infuriating to me that basically every fifth person just jumps over the gates for free and no one cares. I'm paying full price and the free riders act like it's their right.2) The majority of the free riders are vagrant drug attics. The do their drugs in the train often smoking something that smell synthetic that eve permeates your mask. They leave their garbage in the train. A lot are also mentally unstable and make the train unsafe. Some may scoff but this is reality!I would propose that Bart does a pilot program to install New York like gates that go all the way up. Test this at a pilot station then install more. Until the two points I listed above are addressed I would rather pay more to park than ride Bart. It's sad because I know Bart has a budget deficit and decreased ridership. But the Bay Area needs Bart!
1,"Jul 11, 2023","Don't I wish I could use public transportation but by all means, it doesn't work for me. The location in question - Berryessa San Jose. Once again, there are no Zeros or negative numbers in the Star options. The ""brief"" version:It took me almost 5 minutes to find a ticket machine for parking to pay, more out of orders than working ones, finally I made it - too bad I missed the first train. I have a Clipper account, charged with $30 (months ago), have the Clipper App downloaded and it confirms the $30 on the card, using an Android phone with NFC and I thought I am ready to go. Well, the card reader that did not have the ""out of order"" sticker did not cooperate. It was very persistent telling me please touch card again. So, it recognized there was a card - my phone with NFC - but it refused to let me into the station. After many attempts at all possible entrances, I pressed the ""help button"". The recommendation was to call Clipper, they are responsible :( I called and they told me, the Clipper App is not what I need, I need Google wallet to get in. Okay, I downloaded Google wallet and sure enough the Clipper card showed up with a $30 amount, isn't life wonderful :) Unfortunately the next train just left the station. Here we go, convinced the stupid Clipper system finally lets me in - WRONG - same message, please touch card again at all possible scanners I found. At the main entrance I found a lady from BART, explained my situation and what I tried, she apologized profoundly and recommended to buy a new plastic Clipper card, charging it with another amount to use it. Most of the Clipper machines where out of order and the one working did not offer a ""buy Clipper card"" option. She tried to use my phone as well to get in, no such luck. The whole user / customer / passenger (not really) experience was worse than ever before when it was much easier to buy a ticket for a single ride. The next train was gone by now and after about 40 minutes utterly frustrated, I decided to skip my trip to SFO as I was in such a bad mood, nothing positive was to be expected.What I did not mention, this was the second time with a very similar experience, the first time I had to drive to Oakland airport to pick up my daughter instead of taking BART. Maybe I was just an outlier, but I need to make sure that there is a record of the overall miserable customer experience at this location. Don't think that BART is a viable alternative for people like myself using the (well trying to use) the transit system every now and them.I am a big fan of public transportation, if it works, like it does in other countries, but I do understand if people in the Bay Area consider it a waste of money subsidizing BART.Just close it down and provide free UBER or LYFT, probably cheaper and for sure more reliable."
