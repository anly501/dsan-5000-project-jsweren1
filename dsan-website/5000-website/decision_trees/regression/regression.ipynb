    "## Introduction to Decision Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Trees are a supervised learning technique that uses non-parametric methods for classification and regression. This differs from many disciplines of mathematical modeling, as non-parametric statistics do not make assumptions about the distribution of the sample's population. Thus, regardless of the distribution, Decision Trees attempt to create models from the data simply by creating sequential sets of rules. These rules can be interpreted as sets of `if-else` statements, as we would understand them in programming. In this regard, Decision Trees follow the process of creating a conditions, assessing whether or not an observation follows that condition, and assigns an outcome based on the result. This can then be repeated iteratively to the resulting value when applying a different condition, thus creating a set of splits with different trajectories to resemble a tree diagram.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, Decision Trees can be categorized into two methods: classification and regression. Classification Decision Trees will be recapped on the `Classification` tab of this section.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression trees are specifically used for when a target variable takes on continuous values. To do this, they attempt to estimate the local nature of the underlying function (i.e., how  a particular variable impacts the target at a certain value or range of values), rather than the global shape of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, each condition will be a question of whether a record fits a value or a range of values for a particular variable, and each node is a predicted numerical output that will estimate the target based on a condition. Due to the discrete nature of decision trees and the fact that the target variable is continuous, this can result in large error, so applying error metrics is crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "One method that will be applied below is *pruning*, which is a very common way of simplifying trees. Doing this cuts down on the number of leaves by replacing excess nodes and their respective subtrees with singular leaves. This can significantly reduce the size of a tree, as well as improve performance in cases where accuracy of a training set deteriorates as overfitting begins to occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, we will also be using random forests for improved supervised learning. This is a widely used bagging algorithm, which takes a decision tree and attempts to improve its stability and accuracy. This will mainly be useful for reducing variance and preventing overfitting, and will also serve as a way to evaluate the predictiveness of each input variable."

    "\n",
    "![Cost_per_trip Boxplot](../../images/box2.png)\n",

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "When comparing these results to our data science question, it is important to think about what particular action items a city can take to improve their public transit system. Due to the presence of two target variables, we can analyze performance as a combination of two metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, the proportional volume of public transit usage is a great indicator of how much a city's residence depend on those resources. From our analysis, it appears that the amount of ridership depends most heavily on the size of the city, with larger cities outperforming smaller cities in trips per capita.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we will see in classification trees and through intuition, this is expected. Larger cities often have more robust public transit infrastructure, denser populations, and less reliance on travel by car. Unfortunately, it is then difficult to prescribe action items for a city, as success in this metric is largely dependent on the city's underlying characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, cost per trip tells us the financial viability of a public transit system. A city that offers more services per dollar is more likely to view that resource as necessary for its residents. Our results tell us that this is also largely a function of the city's characteristics. A trip is likely to cost more if it services longer trips."
