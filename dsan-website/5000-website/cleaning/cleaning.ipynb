    "Lastly, the purpose of this data is to see the rates at which demographic groups use different modes of transportation for commuting to their occupation. The raw data set contains all demographic differentiators in the same table, which would be classified as untidy data. Thus, it will be necessary to split these into several tables; one for each demographic type. Additionally, the columns denoting percent error are useful for understanding the data, but could be cumbersome for conducting EDA, so we will only be focusing on the proportions given in the data columns. \n",
    "\n",
    "Cleaning this data set will allow us to use `R` to clean qualitative, as well as quantitative variables. The following are steps for carrying this out:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Read full .csv file and rename columns for readability based on glossary given by the data source\n",
    "- Select only rows that split records by `age`, and only columns that contain data points\n",
    "- Trim leading spaces from `age` column\n",
    "- Remove percentage symbol from numeric fields and convert them to numeric data type\n",
    "- Repeat process for `sex`, `race`, `citizenship status`, and `earnings`\n",
