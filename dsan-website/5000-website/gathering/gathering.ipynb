We will be using the survey data gathered from 2021, the most recent sample available, and one with a significantly large volume of responses. The main reason for obtaining this data is the presence of a \"Means of transportation to work\" field, which will serve as our labels for supervised learning. This can tell us the commute methods for a large sample of respondents, whom we can analyze by looking at demographic and lifestyle data to gather insights on what factors into one's means of transportation to work.\n",

Our goal here is to assess what factors impact public transit ridership and cost-effectiveness for a city to determine any action items that can be taken to improve such metrics. Every quarter, the American Public Transit Association (APTA) conducts a Ridership Report which includes key performance indicators of public transit systems across the US. Our analysis will use data from their Third Quarter 2023 Ridership Report, which is the most recent one available at the time of writing this.\n",

Therefore, any given city may have several rows, possibly split into Agency, as multiple organizations may serve a single city to provide service to its residents. These agencies are also split by row, corresponding to the mode of transportation. Another notable aspect of this data is that it includes general information about each city, such as population and area. In this case, records have the same value in these columns for each city, so when cleaning, we can consolidate records by city and not worry about conflating differing values. This will allow us to not only focus on features of public transit systems in a vacuum, but also observe characteristics of cities that may lead to various public transit phenomena.

Many workers enjoy the benefits of privacy and the added time of not having to commute, while employers often cite advantages of being on-site even in office jobs. While in-person work has rebounded recently, much like public transit usage, it has not nearly returned to the prevalence of prior to the pandemic. Therefore, understanding trends surrounding remote work can provide insights on how to analyze public transportation trends.\n",
