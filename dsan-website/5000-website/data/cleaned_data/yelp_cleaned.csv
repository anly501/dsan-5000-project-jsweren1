2,4,"Nov 3, 2023","What do I know, I'm just a stupid tourist who comes into the city once a year and takes 3-4 subway rides each time.A lot cleaner than some of our Philly train stations, that's for sure. Pretty easy to figure out how to get from place to place with Google maps.Love the contactless method - tap and go.",mta
3,1,"Aug 23, 2023","This Company is A Literally A Gangsters Mafia , an Organized Group of Criminals with uniforms !!! and I'll explain exactly why I say that . (1) they are stilling people's money , by damaging their metro cards on purpose !!! In the Busses and subway train station machines !! All that is happening from one reason only that people would buy another card , and another one , and if you send your damaged card to them ? they taking the card and say goodbye to your card and to your money !!! For example in the last six months , I buy in the beginning of the month , a monthly unlimited metro card , pay 127$ !!! And already twelve times I purchased the same card again and again , I mean in a six months !!! why ? Because suddenly and surprisingly the card after two weeks or so is damaging !!! So you guys probably asking how come ? And why every card ?? So I'll say /ask the same question to you !! How come every time a different card in a different trains and buses of MTA damaging after two weeks or sometimes after one week ?? And if it's happening to me , who can tell me how many people in NY , it's happening to them also in the same way ?? And I don't play with the card or use it in not appropriate way , like throw it like a garbage in places that would damage the card !! No No !! it comes out of the wallet in the morning , I use it in the bus and the train and it goes back to the wallet !!! No games with the card !! But any it gets damaged !!! And every month after two or three weeks of use !!! I don't get to use it the whole mont !!! And I use it only two times in a day , on my way to work and when I go back home !!! And I buy Monthly unlimited on purpose , because I live in Long Island , and working in Brooklyn !!! So the cost of day by day to pay 11$ cost to much for me , only for the transportation , plus I need food so I don't want to spend that much money in every month so I use / Buy the Monthly card !!! But this company decided I guess to still the peoples money !!! And again , if it's happening to me ? Who promises that it's not happening to thousands of people in NY every Month ?? And every day ?? One hundred percent for sure that it's happening to a lot more people !!! And by that ? they forcing people to buy their "" new  technology  card ""  and pay more and more money , The OMNI card !!! instead of pay one time monthly purchase metro card and use it for a monthly unlimited uses the people have to pay for each ride separately !!! (2) Look in the Subway tunnels , always dirty like a pothole's !!! Full of Homeless people that bother everyone , including tourists !!! And the company making millions and Billions of money !!! where that money goes ?? Look at their representatives !!! How they treating innocent people that come to ask simple questions about how to use this and how to do that , or for directions to somewhere !!! Go by yourself , Go to places like Flushing NY !!! Or Bronx !! Or Brooklyn NY !!! insulting People , and they get out of it without any punishment !!! why ?? Because they are a Big organized  company!!! And they can bring to the courthouses more lawyers !!  And know exactly that you can not allow to yourself to pay !!! And they pay them with the money they stilling from the people !!! the individual citizens can not do anything against them !!! That's why they are the only one company in NY !!! They are the only Monopoly company in NY , and They Have the union that Belongs to them , and fallow the American History , how the Union started to build up in America !!! And the people in NY city don't have any other choice only to use their services , Because ther is no other companies around in the area to use their services with a normal price to go to places from the five boroughs to Manhattan and back !!! and you can not to talk with them even !!! Like Every other Gangster in the world , they will call the police on you !!! And will put you in jail for at least seven years !!!  But they they can talk to you whatever way they want !! To insult you !!! And kick you out of the bus or the train and you can't do nothing at all against them !!! In other words ?? They are A Big Cruel Filthy Mafia !!! Gangsters !!! Nothing else !!! That's what I feel on this MTA Company !!! I wish I had another choice to use other companies cervices in a reasonable prices to go to work and back !! But there is non of them !!!",mta
4,1,"Nov 29, 2023","The Q65 bus tonight has no screens on to show the routes, too dark to see any signs, missed a stop, had to shout twice for back door to get off a stop. Why  are we paying for services at night anyway?",mta
5,1,"Oct 25, 2023","Why should customers pay $2.90 for buses that skip their bus stops? The Q3 bus driver ignored me and skipped the bus stop even though I signaled and he had time to stop there was sufficient space even though repairs are being done at the side of the road. Regardless the bus driver still had the time and space to stop at at 180th street Hillside Avenue. I don't think bus drivers are friendly at all with that attitude. What if an elderly person was waiting for that bus, then what? Please clean up the act, thanks.",mta
6,1,"Oct 16, 2023","Are MTA bus drivers supposed to ignore customers that wave at the stop sign? Why are the bus drivers in a rush and ignore us? Such as Q3, that is not customer service.",mta

11,1,"Jul 31, 2023","Wasted $2.75 on a fare where no notices were posted, train does not even go to stillwell Ave or Manhattan because area is blocked off, no signs stating this, no notices, no nothing. MTA is not doing well, why are they not hiring workers to speed up these delayed services? I need a refund!",mta
12,1,"Jul 15, 2023","I do not recommend using the MTA for work on Saturday, service is terrible. Delays, lies on the map, lies on the transit app, app shows bus already when the bus did not even arrive at the bus stop. Trains are slow, 30 mins wait is too much to ask for, I expect better from the MTA, as a matter of fact service should be free on Saturdays given the worst service ever for today.",mta
13,1,"Feb 3, 2023","Very long to wait, worst service ever especially when it's very windy and cold to travel to work on Fridays. Excuses from the MTA is all bullshit, we all have to work too and what's the excuse?",mta
14,1,"Dec 7, 2022","Both buses and trains are slow for going to work at nights, as slow as traffic or slower pretty much screwed in New York. Better to move out of New York",mta
15,1,"Nov 10, 2022","Poor service, not helpful as a process server job to rely on the MTA with its constant delays with the F, M and R trains. Could be worse for any other job as far as I know. I would like to see improvements if that's possible for the MTA to ever make any improvements since people have it hard enough to even get to their jobs knowing it's worse with traffic as it is for driving and parking.",mta

19,1,"Nov 11, 2021","Poor service, lazy people should be fired in search for better workers. Deserves an F rating. Also they steal fares from Metro card to swipe again",mta
20,1,"Nov 26, 2023",Do you have some automated system for your delay ticket responses because there is no way on God's green earth you are denying these insane delays from patrons. It totally should be the reverse. Putting people in jeopardy of every day for your flippant attitudes towards this (lack of) service. Honestly how dare you guys. Be better (3x).,mta
21,1,"Nov 13, 2023","I know this review will fall on deaf ears so consider this speaking my disgust into an empty, deep-pocketed void. I absolutely love when the machines don't work so patrons are forced to jump to avoid missing their trains right where cops are conveniently placed... but all of a sudden they are no where to be found when you have people passing out on the platform from heat exhaustion, sick individuals that threaten to harm an entire subway car during your daily morning commute so you have to resort making a report through a Twitter DM (totally not speaking from experience)... absolutely disgusted at the regression of service since the fare hike. If anything, you should have waited until all of these services were in ship and sharp standing before charging people extra for your seriously embarrassing delays. Pull yourselves together. Forget the visual ascetics and focus on your failing, broken infrastructure.",mta
22,1,"Nov 25, 2021","Consider this as an over arching review of the nearly three decades I've been alive being born and raised in the city and the possibly 13 to 14 years I've used this system to commute to either school or work. Question: how are you guys getting worse as time goes on? I could care less about the high tech ads or whatever new ad-on that natives don't give two shits about. Yeah, a nifty subway is absolutely welcomed, but could you maybe focus your updates on your trains to be a little more punctual, you know, services people actually care about? I remember going to high school and I could actually predict when a train was going to pull in to my station, as came in around the same time every morning. Now, you'd be lucky if a train even pulled in!Tell me how you guys want to keep raising these prices on fares but then decide to do track work in the middle of a work day and shut down both sides of the tracks so people are stranded every which way. Get your shit together. And stop raising the price on rides. Like everyone has the luxury to pay for this incompetent service.And OMNY is such a ridiculous idea. Like everyone living here has the privilege of smart phones and credit cards. AND considering the city's up in crime since the pandemic, that makes no sense to implement a system to flash those items out in the open in order to hold a ride.",mta

24,1,"Aug 12, 2022","Current NYC mayor Eric Adams seems to have even less common sense than his pez-headed predecessor Bill de Blasio, if that's even humanly possible. The MTA's scheme to raise $1B in incremental revenue through congestion pricing for automobiles entering Manhattan is fraught with so many unintended consequences that I can only assume that they are in fact, intended and the comedians who run city government just don't care. In a scenario laid out by British newspaper The Daily Mail (London already has a similar plan) a ride into NYC from my home in Princeton will trigger $120 in congestion pricing on top of tolls, gas, parking etc. No sympathy expected, it's just an illustration.That's $200+ just to come to Manhattan in order to work, dine, play, shop etc. I don't care whether I can afford to pay or not, this punitive tax is an automatic non-starter. Under this plan it would literally be cheaper to fly into Dallas to catch a Rangers game than arrive at MSG by car. Of course that example is not perfect but you get my point. Adams is screaming for remote workers to return to their offices full time via mass transit but the Subway (not to mention the streets) remains a crime spree so who's kidding who Mr. Mayor. And as we all know the MTA is a dumping ground for cronyism and political patronage so a profound no thank you to their very porous fiscal oversight.So now you're in Manhattan and an Uber or Lyft will run you an additional $40 on top of their ridiculous dynamic pricing. Do they really want to turn Manhattan over once and for all to the gilded plutocrats for whom no cost is an impediment or imposition. Maybe they do. I have commuted to and worked in Gotham for decades (mostly on public transit) and would have no problem writing off NYC completely with my middle finger waving in the breeze.Do the Apparatchiks in NYC ever stop to consider the countless micro-decisions people make everyday about where to spend their money. If tax revenue falls 10-15 percent because tri-state suburbanites decide to venture in less often -- what happens to the majority of mainstream restaurants and theaters in Manhattan already dealing with depressed patronage. The Met Galas of the world will always be fine, it's the remaining 99.9 percent of commerce that I worry about. It's just insane.My firm belief is that NYC's government is congenitally stupid and so desperate for revenue that I have no doubt whatsoever that some version of this hair brain scheme will be implemented. Goodbye NYC you can see by my finger I think you're number 1.(BTW, if some version of this passes, there's little doubt that congestion pricing will soon be coming to a city near you.)",mta
25,5,"Aug 3, 2022","Today I used the MTA Mobile Van Service because my Senior Metro Card stopped working. The card is an online automatically refill because they have my credit card on file. When my trips reduce my account to $10 balance they bill my credit card $25. I can't refill it at the subway. You can call 511 for Metro Card problems and the MTA representative will tell you where the van will be located near you. I also found the full list of locations online at the website. I decided to walk to 78th on York today because the weather was not too warm. At first the line looked intimidating but within 15 minutes I was next to go inside. The employees are all definitely friendly,  professional, and people persons! I gave the one employee a laugh when he asked the problem and I said my Metro Card is broken. Once inside the really nice employee asked for the card and a photo ID. He said he would need to call to verify the balance on my card and then he would have the ability to take possession and give me a temporary Senior Card. He then also filled out a form that was multiple copies with all my information. I received one as my receipt. Then he said if I had cash I would be able to put money onto my temporary card right there or I could wait and go to the subway to put money on it. I took advantage of giving him enough money for Five Trips. The temporary card is good until September 30, 2022. He assured me my new card would come by then. If not I have to get another temporary card. He also advised me when I get the new card to use up the balance on the temporary first. When they put your cash on the card they show you the balance on it using their scanner. I'm so glad they have this service. The van is at the 92 Street Y the first Thursday each month 10-12. If tomorrow wasn't going to be so hot I would use that location. If I have problems in the future I'll know what to do now. They really made me feel like a valued customer and they have the drill down so it's as smooth as a babies butt. I'm recommending!",mta
26,5,"Sep 4, 2019","I cannot think of a better review for my NUMBER 1300 than the MTA. Everyone can complain all you want. Look at the numbers people! Look at the number of buses and trains that operate daily on a 24 hour Seven day 365 day basis. Look at the number of riders. Look at the great improvement like the Second Avenue Q Train. I survived the construction! The employees are neat and clean in their uniforms. I spoke to two this morning. They are on the job in shifts. Five in the morning to 1pm and around the clock. They are friendly and responsive when you are in need. I know some subway stations are old and dirty. I see the homeless. What do you expect with over 8.5 million people in the city? I'm paying a lot of tax. Yes there are things that I feel my money is wasted on. I can definitely say MTA is not one of them. Come visit my city. Ride the bus and train. Enjoy the sights. Breathe in the fine NYC Air (hahaha). When you do, please remember the vast number of hard working employees that are making all of this possible on a daily basis. Tell them 'Thanks' if you have the opportunity. They really do appreciate hearing it from YOU!",mta
27,1,"Aug 26, 2023","MTA services sucks, they're run the trains on weekends saying they fixing signals, but doesn't seems to be true, tracks are empty and nobody working. And when really happens trains are soooo unsincronized trains take forever to certain destination whenever you get off to take train was express the other one cross tracks closes doors leaving hundreds of people behind that needed  get to their destinations, why MTA ask money for? There is no improvements, services still a shit always. The Mafia MTA keeps this improvements going on and on because they wanna always ask for money and raise fairs, if they modernize  everything they can't still more money.",mta

32,1,"Sep 21, 2023",the #2 and #5 line is the worse.they're unorganized and have absolutely zero regards for new york riders. every time you're on this line you're in danger and will be home 1 hour added to your regular commute eta. i tried not to blame them but seeing so many workers milking it. where theres no need pissed me off. mta is a bunch of privileged union workers that drive suvs and dodge chargers. the 2 line is the worst of all lines. ps mta get it together before you keep hiking the price.. like wtf is a booth attendant doing?,mta
33,1,"Aug 31, 2023","There's a lovely invention called a ""watch"" - None of the Suffolk Transit drivers or LIRR conductors semen to have heard of one. Trains are late which makes me miss my bus or vice versa, miss a transfer bus etc. Some if us have places we need to be at specific times, I'd think Transit operators would be the prime example but apparently no.",mta
34,1,"Aug 18, 2023","Today I took the B train to get to work and I couldn't seat down because all the seat were completely wet because of the rain, the escalators at 34th street wasn't working and a lot of people had to go up to the platform for the Q train, how the MTA is increasing the fare when the service is worst every day, this is increíble.​",mta
35,1,"Apr 11, 2023","On 3/30/23 I experienced a transit delay where my train did not come to the station for over 30 minutes. The station displays were not working and the booth operator did not provide us with any information/updates on the situation. It was FREEZING that day so I ended up driving to work rather than continue to wait in the station.Now the MTA is denying my transit delay application with the response ""We have researched your request. Our records indicate that the trip you took did not experience a delay as you described."" Really!?! What kind of research did you do?! I want to know, because you came to the wrong results.The 7:02 AM train DID NOT COME!!!",mta
36,4,"Oct 6, 2020","The MTA is kinda like the MET. Both are overpriced, both are now catering to the rich, and both smell funky.If you're looking for the school meeting then you're looking for the PTA not the MTA.New York transportation is something special. It's been around for a long time and in some regards - okay in many regards - it looks like it's been around for a long time. Some of the employees aren't friendly, and some of them are better. It services soooo many people from so many places in so many neighbourhoods, and it's pretty impressive. The network is pretty vast and endless. I like it but I don't like all the price hikes.Not to be confused with MBA, which you probably have if you're Yelping. Lol.But remember... MTA = Might Take Ages.",mta
37,1,"Aug 5, 2023","Unsafe, unclean etc etc. all's workers got nasty attitudes when you ask for directions. They force you to take a shuttle bus in between stations on weekends and make you pay twice. Shit is ass. On behalf of of nyc smd.",mta

42,1,"Dec 8, 2021","If you're thinking of moving to NYC then here's my opinion: Rude employees with no comfortable rides. Constant delays on most trains.  Crowded, Dirty, and jerky train rides. Homeless people laying and sleeping in the stations and on the trains. But what other options are there?  Driving between boroughs on work days is out of the question because traffic in the  busiest city in the country is ridiculous.  So you're stuck with few options other than with this uncomfortable mode of transportation if you do decide to move here.  GOOD LUCK!!",mta
45,1,"Feb 24, 2023","I am absolutely mortified. Today I had lost my transfer metro card and needed to transfer to the b13 bus at dekalb ave and wycoff ave. I feel completely violated that a bus driver looked me up and down and asked if I could think of any possible way to pay for my fare. I said no and he replied ""that's a shame cuZ I really want to help a beautiful girl like you, "" as he staring at my chest instead of my eyes... I immediately got off the bus and felt disgusted... I'd rather walk then be subjected to being sexually propositioned for $2.75!! A simple "" no ma'am you need fare"" would have been a sufficient answer. The look in his eyes and tone if his voice was behind creepy!! Come on MTA you can do better than this type of behavior !!",mta
46,1,"Sep 26, 2021","Can't think of anything good to say about the MTA. The subways are slow, unreliable, and sometimes dirty. Possibly also unsafe if you believe media reports. The subway costs twice as much to operate as similar systems in Europe and even some parts of the US. Multiple investigations (by the New York Times, Bloomberg, and the former governor) have shown that overtime fraud is rampant. MTA workers claim overtime pay and leave work early. Even if you don't use mass transit, you're probably paying the MTA hundreds of dollars a year in the form of at least four different taxes.",mta

51,1,"Jun 8, 2023",MTA in NYC is unpredictable and unreliable. The fare does not match the quality and the service they should give New Yorkers.  MTA needs to do better and probably has some training in Europe train facilities for better improvement as NY is one of the greatest City in the world.,mta
52,1,"Aug 18, 2023","Worst POS bus schedule on the entire Earth. Don't ever expect the bus to be on time it'll never happen no matter what time or day it is. The sites and map apps are the worst they never tell you when the bus will come. And if they do it'll tell you it's coming in 10,7,5,2,1 and then it'll say it's departing now. And the whole time your standing there like a penis while the bus never comes. Or sometimes it'll say the bus is 7 minutes away so your standing at the bus stop like a hooker waiting to get picked up expecting it to actually come in 7 min because the cocksucking site says it will then it never shows up. very unreliable, this is what the prices are going up for? For us to be willing to pay and you not being able to hire enough drivers to drive the bus when it's there only job? Hire more people then. Thanks a lot never trust the MTA save yourself time you'll never get back, and buy a car or a bike.",mta
53,1,"Aug 14, 2023","all the people who work for mta are very greedy. they raise the subway fare almost every year. the subways are not running on schedule as they should, and they always have delays. the buses are even worse because you have to wait for them forever, and they go slowly because of the red lights. on august 20 the subway and bus fare will be 2.90, which is ridiculous because their service is lousy. the workers always demand more money because they are never satisfied with their salaries. why do they need so much money? they probably want a beautiful funeral. they also think that they will take their money to the grave with them. good luck with that, because that has not been invented yet!!",mta
54,1,"Nov 26, 2022",I really really hate taking the subway trains because they keep doing constructions every day now. Now they are doing constructions on weekdays too. The busses are even worse because you have to wait for them   forever. One day I was waiting for the bus for 40 minutes and I thought that it will never come. This nightmare has to stop because I have no patience waiting for subway trains and busses all day long. There is also a big problem with 511 representatives because they are giving me the wrong directions on purpose. I don't call them anymore because I don't want to waste my precious time on these liars. I don't understand why MTA raises the subway fare every year   I refuse to pay a lot of money for this lousy service! DROP DEAD AND GO TO HELL!  AMEN                MARINA MANASHIROVA,mta

What if you don't have the ""right""kind of phone or a credit card that the MTA deems acceptable?Or no credit card or phone at all?Do any of these MTA executives live in the real world  with people that actually take subways and buses or are they just in their city cars?

It is getting expensive but still less than a taxi. Don't even think about getting on one of the awful busses. I only gave it a second star because it is quick (most of the time) and less costly than other modes of transport in the city. Fogettabout it on weekends when services are rerouted and disrupted. You have no idea whee you are going and how to get there since no one works in the boots anymore. An antiquated system for use by way too many people it has no future but to get worse",mta

Turns out they do not offer a replacement, only a refund. Not only that, the refund is a check or a credit on the card you used to purchase. The gentleman at the registration gets your info and sorts people out before grabbing a ticket. Decent guy but a bit rude. The guy at the customer service desk was even more curt and wasnt really trying to help me. Once I explained I was from out of town he offered the credit charge back.

The guy at the customer service desk was even more curt and wasnt really trying to help me. Once I explained I was from out of town he offered the credit charge back. That's should've been offered as an option from the getgo.Overall, it was quick (less than 30) and efficient. I'll take that, especially for a govt agency.",mta

65,2,"Jan 21, 2020","Crap. It's nice being able to not drive but this can be frustrating. The MTA is the local subway  system in NYC. Not all of it is bad. Of course, much more of it sucks like shit.  First the good. It has a way to get unlimited rides. There's weekly and monthly passes that you can use countless times. Bad things now. The passes are made of a tough paper, which if you're not careful enough, can get ruined. In DC they have plastic cards. Why not here? If you're extra careful like me you'll put the cards where they can't get bent. This doesn't always prevent problems. Sometimes the cards just won't work for no reason at all. That's enough about the cards. A lot more is bad. The thing getting the most complaints is the poor service. If you're paying for this system through not just your card purchases but also through your paychecks, it should give you reliable service as in trains not being delayed and other annoyances. Trains routinely have many problems.  How about fixing that air conditioning or heat. The booth workers also seem to have surliness as part of their job requirements. Many stations are really fucking gross. Walls are covered in black mold or piss stains. It still is the best transportation available. Much better than paying for outrageous cab fare. That's not saying much for the subway though.",mta

68,1,"Jan 6, 2020","Ah, MTA - you take one of the world's greatest cities and make transport so bad that it wouldn't even be fit for purpose in the smallest of UK town's.The MTA really makes me grateful for the transportation systems we have in the UK even if they can be pretty shoddy in their own rights, it makes Northern Rail look like the Hogwarts Express for goodness sake.The subway might be one of the fastest ways to get around town, but I really don't understand - Why do they have different numbered routes and different colours with no obvious signs to which goes where- Why are stations so dirty and smelly?- Why are staff at stations generally rude?- Why can't you pay with contactless with a similar system to London's Oyster Card? When travelling in the Big Apple you pay one fee regardless of going one stop or several, this is compared to London's zonal system where you can travel in central London zones 1 and 2 for £7 per day (even international tourists), this means you can hop on and off all day on buses, trams or the tube, meanwhile MTA just charges you per journey.- Why is disabled access so poor? There is only one gate at most stations for prams/wheelchairs which requires a special disabled MTA ticket otherwise you could be stranded trying to get in/out which makes no sense.I also noticed the buses seemed so old too, spraying harmful smoke everywhere and the overcrowded, dirty, old subway trains weren't much better either.The transit system of NYC and the only way to get across the city and all of its' boroughs (buses, subway) is just so shockingly poor. I'm not sure how the system works in the states, but if Transport for London operated to such standards they'd be mass riots and something would be done and I think it's just unacceptable how they've been able to carry on with sub-par services while still charging high costs to get around.1*",mta

74,5,"Nov 11, 2019","Yes, that is right, I am writing a review for the best subway system in the United States bar none. In fact, that goes for the entire transit network, the LIRR, Metro North, the whole kit and caboodle. But this review will focus more on the subway. The New York City Subway is one of it's kind, with 469 subway stations and vast lines formerly owned by several companies before the MTA bought them all and now own and operate the subway as it's own. And they do a damn good job at maintaining it despite it's flaws. Is it perfect? No. Far from it. But for a system that is 115 years old, I would say that this is the system to mimic for all it is worth. It stops EVERYWHERE. It is CHEAP. It is THE BEST DEAL IN THE CITY. Trains are fast, frequent, and always available. It is a 24/7 system after all!And the system is always looking to modernize. Yes the system sometimes shows it's age, but at the same time it is always looking ahead towards the future. Automating lines, improving the stations, making safer walkways, there is always something to be done here. The New York City Subway is the reason I love trains. I mean once you start riding it maybe you can understand why I feel so strongly about this network of trains running above and below ground. It just feels so right to ride it everywhere. Complain all you want about the delays during rush hour and weekend maintenance, but somebody's got to be inconvenienced if you want it to continue to run at a high level. That is a small price to pay. Speaking of small prices, you just cannot find any other deal like this one in New York, and it pays off, big time.",mta
75,5,"Apr 22, 2019","State of the motha effin' art! For REAL! This transit system is world renowned and there's a perfectly good reason as to why; because it's effective and will get you to practically ANY borough of New York during any and all hours of the day and night. It's crazy to think that the rating is only an average of 2 stars. But then again, I don't live here. I don't know all of the ""issues"" that may be associated with this transit system. However, what I DO know is that it saved me so much money and time while visiting New York. Before I hopped on an NY subway for the first time, I could never understand why so many New Yorkers didn't know how to drive. I mean... you can ""try"" to do this in Cali, but good luck. It's hard trying to get around here on public transportation, let alone in and around the far East Bay Area and beyond. And like NY, ridesharing and taxicabs are just too expensive to be taking every day. Once I hopped amidst that mystical subway train, I knew that I would probably never rent a car or take a taxicab in NY ever again. NOW I understand why all of you New Yorkers don't know how to drive! Because you don't have to!!! The MTA goes every damn where! I am so jealous that we aren't this advanced in California. To honest, our transit system is laughable when even compared to the buses in NY! So ridiculous, but so true. It's hard to believe that this train station is over 100 years old and is still in working condition, transporting millions of people throughout New York each year! I'm sure some things can be spruced up of course, but generally speaking, this transit system is amazing. For one thing, the majority of the subway stations are located underground. Nowadays, that's not really ideal I guess. But it's just amazing how fast you can get from one end of NY to the other on the subway. Tons of people take the trains at all hours of the day and night, so if you're going solo, you won't feel alone. The stops are never too far apart from each other. NY's transit system uses a ""Metrocard"" which is good for all public transportation within the state including the NYC transits subways, local and express bus lines, Staten Island Railway, the Airtran to JFK, and a few other transit partners. The cost per ride is around $3 and you can refill your card at any Station Booth or Metrocard vending machine. They also have a 7 day and 30 day unlimited ride passes available. I purchased a 7 day unlimited ride pass for around $30 and it was really a great deal. I've spoken with a few locals in the area who have told me that the prices for the train are expensive. But to be honest, these prices are WAAAAY cheaper than our Bart train in the Bay Area! I could easily spend $10 a day getting to work and back, and that's just a short distance compared to other people who have to travel much further. I would GLADLY pay for their unlimited passes to get around NY if I lived there. Since the trains are underground, phone reception can be pretty non-existent. The train stations aren't the cleanest but I've seen a lot worse where I live. If you're carrying large luggage, good luck trying to get it through the tiny little entryway! I struggled trying to get my luggage through, and it was only a carry-on bag... okay fine, it was overstuffed... but STILL! I wish they had a least one wider entrance for large bags. Oh yeah... and all of those stories about huge NY rats at the train stations... yep, it's true. I saw the biggest rat of my entire LIFE just moseying along the waiting area at one of the stations. While I was practically dying, everyone else just went about their business and the rat ran clear across the platform. I ran to the other side. This Cali girl was NOT about to be getting attacked by a damn cat sized rat! Aside from those nuances, I truly envy NYC's transit system. I hope that one day California's transit system will advance the way that NY's has. But until then, I'm stuck with this sh*t that we call a train! NY, you need to be more appreciative of the MTA! It's a wonderful perk to have.",mta

80,4,"Nov 24, 2018","I think my bf and I were incredibly lucky the weekend we used the MTA in NYC. After trying to use an Uber or two -- they were expensive AF, just not ideal for a quick ride (the wait was sometimes 8+ mins), and NYC tends to be  busy - the ride alone takes a long time. Remember: train stations are everywhere in NYC. Download the CityMapper app on your phone. It tells you live updates on the trains & which station to go into. Super easy. I'm directionally challenged and I was able to figure it out! We got the unlimited 7 day pass for like 30 bucks each? Around there, it wasn't outrageous. Note: we were constantly going somewhere. The unlimited pass came in handy and it saved us $$$ ride-wise (again Uber is expensive AF in NYC!). And I think 7 days is the minimum for the ""unlimited"" pass. They have more days available but we were only staying in NYC for like 4 days. As for the trains - most of them came on time (perhaps like 90%). The other 10% of the time, the trains were delayed maybe 5 mins. I heard other NYC-ers tell me that trains are sometimes very delayed.

88,3,"Oct 3, 2015","Oh... the MTA subway system..In my 20+ years in this city.. A couple of positives. LONG list of negatives. Some interesting experiences. Some interesting people.First of all, I agree with reviewer Tina C., in that ""New York City has the MOST efficiently covered citywide system. It is truly the ONLY one system in the whole world that operates 24/7 @ 365 days a year."" Now I can't speak for other major cities, but I can speak for my home city of Shanghai. Ok, last time I was back in Shanghai was 2011..and even then, the subways in Shanghai..however technologically advanced they were compared to NYC, however clean and well maintained they were compared to the dump that is MTA's subways.. The subways in Shanghai DO NOT run 24/7. So just on that point alone..NYC's subways has the win! But damn..back to the maintenance issue. Many of NYC's subway stations are so filthy! The stations themselves are dirty.. the tracks have so much garbage..frequently starting track fires that cause delays in the commute. Lots of homeless people congregate in the subways too. From my experiences in taking the E and F trains, I've seen homeless people hog an entire corner in the a subway car, sleeping on the seats and having bags of their belongings strewn about in front of them. Navigating the subway system is more efficient and easier in recent years. Most major stations have wireless connectivity. And there are many mobile apps you can download like Embark NYC and Exit Strategy, that can give you up-to-date information on Subway times, delays, etc.Taking the NYC subway system as a primary transportation every day..you can see people from all walks of life..and many people may say, that is the ""beauty"" of NYC; it's such a huge melting pot of different cultures. And that's true.. You can see some interesting people in the subways..loll Although, I know many people who say it is because of so many ""weirdos"" in the subways, that they refuse to take the subways and prefer to drive to the city or take the LIRR. So it is honestly a love/hate relationship..loll",mta

Almost at the end of every budget year they scramble for more money and their scrambling is coming up to the citizens of NYC and telling them to cough it up by paying extra for fares. That's crazy. This is in addition to the tax dollars we pay. Where is MTA's money going? In my opinion, I think it goes to pay for unchecked overtime that workers do but who supervises these overtimes, then there's pension and then there is MTA's debt. Why should the citizens of NYC pay for their mistake in mismanaging their money and suffer bad service? I don't need more signs to tell me where my train is or wifi in the train stations, those are added bonuses.

I have no idea when the station is scheduled to be renovated, although the Jay street station one stop up on the A/C line has just been completed.This is a sprawling station that includes both the A and G (Brooklyn-Queens crosstown) lines; there are plenty of inactive platforms, and still it's a pretty efficient station. The G parallels the A here giving you an easy transfer. (The G itself is a whole 'nother story; that train is a sorry piece a woik.)From SubwayNut's guide to stations: http://subwaynut.com/ind/hoyt_schermerhorna/index.php""Hoyt-Schermerhorn Streets is a very unusual IND express station and across platform transfer point between Fulton Street Line A,C trains and Crosstown Line G trains. The station has four island platforms and six tracks in total, with only the central four tracks and two island platforms are currently in use. The outer two island platforms (The A,C trains platform at both tracks) and wall tracks are permanently closed and only saw about ten years of service for the Court Street shuttle, to that IND station that is now the transit museum. The tracks do see service at times for movie shoots and the station name tiling beneath the wall trim has been known to be for other stations from time to time courtesy of this. The station's former large full mezzanine have been cut apart in a completely ridiculous manor, now with a NYPD transit police station and other non-public areas. There are two staircases up from each platform to a small mezzanine towards the middle of the platform to where the station's only fare control area is, after fare control narrow passageways lead in either direction along one side of the former full length mezzanine to a single staircase at each end up to street level to exits along the north side of Schmerhorn Street near either Hoyt Street or Bond Street.

They don't wash them so that they can create jobs tearing them down and putting up new ones with ugly bathroom style tiles and take several months to finish the job (as usual).THE MTA is beyond bad. Here is a blatant example of typical behavior from the system administrators (excuse the confusing language but this exemplifies it)""LADIES & GENTLEMAN THE TRAIN ACROSS THE PLATFORM WILL BE MOVING FIRST"" (the herds scurry across the platform, fear stricken, some panicking, some angry and agitated, many tired) MTA: ""LADIES AND GENTLEMAN THIS TRAIN IS NOW OUT OF SERVICE YOU MUST NOW MOVE ACROSS THE PLATFORM TO THE NEXT TRAIN"" (The doors remain shut, it's cold windy and rainy outside, people are visibly upset, meanwhile subway doors are shut and won't let anyone in the cars) People sit. ""DO NOT BLOCK THE DOORS (Roars the loudspeaker) YOU ARE DELAYING THE TRAINS (Notice how they avert to blaming the MTA customers for the delay and scolding them like little children) The train sits there for 15 minutes and finally moves.

I know they can only stick to their schedule due to traffic but so much....but I've had to wait, and had friends have to wait, for buses which never come....or decide they're not doing the last run of the night...and the only way to find this out is to call some magic number, which isn't easily found through public means, to see if the driver called off.

And to intimidate they cargo even more, they even put those stickers that say ""7 YEARS IN PRISON!"" for complaining against anything. You can observe these stickers in every subway car.They intentionally created a system where there's no responsible person for anything.

We decided to rent an Airbnb close to Harlem (to save on an expensive Manhattan hotel), so we relied on the subway to go to any tourist attraction.  Considering this is a world class city, the subway is an extreme disappointment.Heads up:- Expect delays (during the day, but especially at night). - The M.T.A. can cancel a part of the line unexpectedly, for the whole weekend. Their app won't help as they are slow to update. Download a PDF of the subway map to find an alternative route. - They can also end the train schedule earlier at their own discretion...""from 9 pm to 11 pm."" It was quite unpredictable what time exactly the last train would run. Again, the app/website was not updating as quick as their changes. Always plan an alternate route!! - Some ticket  booth operators are lazy, they will not help you to purchase the exact amount of trips, even if you know how much you want to put in. Plan and do your research! If you know you need 20 trips, pay for exactly 20 trips on your metrocard. If they say only to put $10, and you know you'll be staying for more than 2 days, you're saving them time on your dime. For exactly 20 trips on the pay-per-ride metrocard, I knew to put $52.40 so I would get a 0 balance (technically $0.02) at the end of my trip. I guess they hate counting change, because they insisted on only putting in $20 and just keep adding ""whatever."" - The speakers are crap. Download a .pdf map on your phone, so you feel you know where you're going. - There is Internet! BUT it only works in stations. So when you're actually travelling on the train, you lose connection. What is the point of that? - The subway is really dirty. You do see rats on the tracks. Certain areas can smell like a combination of hot garbage and urine. - There are a lot of panhandlers and drug addicts on the subway.Pros: - It's the cheapest mode of transportation in New York",mta

If it sounds like I'm bragging, consider:* You can ride for miles on just $2.50 - less if you buy a monthly pass - and monthly and pay-as-you-go cardholders alike enjoy unlimited free transfers. Even a beater car or truck will cost you more in the long run. * No matter where you live in the 5 boroughs, your destination is less than an hour away, so long as you know how to take the bus and can understand the coverage maps. Before you throw your hands up and declare the system too confusing to bother with, take an afternoon to memorize the maps. It really helps. * The stations are safe, and most are quiet and acceptably clean. Many folks have vivid memories of MTA trains and stations in the Beame/Koch years and the customer experience has improved by leaps and bounds since then. * Manhattan coverage is arranged on a logical grid system, and identifying which lines take you where is a breeze if you think about them as ""the Lex"" instead of ""4/5/6"" or ""6th Ave. line"" instead of ""B/D/F/M.""* Even if you live beyond a train line, such as in far Eastern Queens or Southern Brooklyn, you will find multiple buses that take you where you need to go. * Most lines run 24/7/365, unlike any other public transit system in the USA.Are our trains and buses sometimes late, occasionally missing (during strikes or inclement weather), and infrequently smelly? Sure. And it also sucks to pay $2.50 per trip if you're used to getting anywhere in NYC for a dollar. But keep in mind that you live in America, a nation of millions who worship the personal automobile and refuse to fund city infrastructure ('cause it's a ""handout"") while demanding that city taxpayers grant them free highway upgrades and low-cost parkway tolls (""they owe me"") across thousands of cul-de-sacs, gated communities, and exurbs in all 50 states. You'll be hard-pressed to find a better transit system without a passport and a pricy plane ticket to capital cities like London and Tokyo. So the only folks who can legitimately complain are those who grew up outside the U.S. Take a deep breath, check the map, swipe your card, and enjoy the ride. The MTA will get you there in the big maze known as NYC.",mta

Seriously there are no words to describe how terrible it is to ride on the hot mess that is the MTA subway but I will try. *sigh * In the past two months I have not made a SINGLE RIDE without a delay or ""train traffic"". I ride 2-3 times a day. I often have to leave 2 hours ahead of time because who knows how many delays may occur. You could literally travel 100 miles or more or go through 2 states in the time it takes to go to Queens to Manhattan. Human piss and feces in the train cars are the norm, I shouldn't have to gag and hold back throw up (which if I did throw up and couldn't clean up myself would probably stay there until it crusted over.) on my commute. Many of the cars don't have ACs in the summer, my experience on the 123 train last year (2016) was 2 out of 3 times the cars did not have air which is difficult if you have asthma. Often times I opted to take an Uber, being able to breathe is a priority but obviously the MTA doesn't take that seriously. I've seen people being carried out on stretchers from heat exhaustion (example 14th St F stop and Jay Metro R train 2016). Trains change over to another line or skip stops without any announcements. The irony of it all is that as I write this the F train conductor all of a sudden announces the Queens bound train is now going back to Brooklyn and that we all need to get off.

The only two problems with the MTA are cleanliness and temperature control (in stations) and for this I can't really blame them because most of their system is running underground 24 hours a day, all that traffic leaving little time for servicing and cleaning. I am disgruntled and upset by MTA's lack of a consistent refund policy. Metrocards expire in a year window. During the two years after that, you have to trade in your card, but that process is way more difficult than it needs to be.  Perhaps it wouldn't be so difficult if I had been told that certain new machines can issue refunds for up to 12 months, and I am just beyond that point now. Terrible training and conflicting information regarding when and how to get a refund. That's the peril you will face if you buy 4.5 rides on one card just to get the 70 cent bonus. Perhaps I should have paid full fare a la carte with paper tickets instead of involving myself in the money waste that is a stored value card. The savings sounds good until you do the percentages and find out how much excess money gets left on the card after usage and reloading.",mta

The London Underground is plastered with maps and it really helps.2. LIST THE STATIONS AT THE PLATFORMS. London Underground has a list of stations that each line stops at, on the wall facing commuters as they board the train. It's hard to get on the wrong train if you see your stop on the station list.3. Keep upgrading the stations.

Yes it is pricier than it was, and the price is going up. I still consider it the main lifeblood holding NYC together.

176,1,"Jun 12, 2017","I had a similar experience as a previous poster regarding EasyPay.  I had purchased an EasyPay Metrocard thinking it would simplify and quicken my daily commute. Firstly, I applied for the card online, and did not receive the card for over 3 weeks. Then, after sometime, the card stopped working and told me to report to an agent (who simply told me to call EasyPay).  It took another 4 weeks to receive a new card.  Recently, I noticed that I had lost my card and reported it as soon as I realized.  Then I began getting all these large charges on my credit card from EasyPay (even though I had set up a specific replenish amount that was nowhere near the amount of these charges).  When I called EasyPay, they told me that I was still responsible for this over $200 charge because it was incurred before I reported the card lost.  If you go into my activity, you will see the general pattern of where and when I use the card, and the sudden influx of uses once it was lost (over 30 uses in one single day at the same location that is NOWHERE near where I use my card). Even though the woman I spoke to agreed that there was an obvious misuse of my card, she said that I am still responsible for the cost. They need to fix this problem so that it doesn't happen again or to anyone else.

184,2,"Jul 4, 2012","The temperature in the actual stations and on the platforms when it's over 90°F outside, feels like it's only somewhat cooler, with all the heat trapped inside, so take note that it will be quite hot inside, while you're walking through the stations and waiting on the platforms.  Inside the trains, it wasn't that bad - at least the ones I went on were all air-conditioned.  The speed and frequency, when it comes to how fast and often the trains arrive and depart, were pretty fast and frequent for the most part.  I used the Metro about 5-6 times during my few days in Manhattan and although I was glad to have been able to get to my destination and back in a relatively quick amount of time -- overall, I wasn't too impressed with it.  Really sucks if you have a problem with your MetroCard though, especially if you happen to encounter a problem with it at an entrance/exit point where there appears to be absolutely no station agent staffing available at all.  If you already paid and the turnstile doesn't work, for example, you're pretty much screwed so you'll have no choice (unless you want to pay your fare twice) but hopefully have someone open the emergency exit door to let you in/out, which of course sets off a loud alarm.  And adding more $ on that existing MetroCard that's not working though, unfortunately does not solve anything nor does it make it work, as we learned, so please do not do that.  You will need to just buy a single-ride ticket and try again.  We thought that inserting the current MetroCard we had into the machines to add more fare would spew out a new one (as some transportation systems do), but this is not the case. The turnstile system here is at times particularly tricky in my opinion and I especially would advise against using the high entrance-exit turnstile, called ""HEET"" (the cage-like revolving doors), unless you absolutely have to.  I understand how the whole concept works and the reason for having these types of turnstiles is to curb fare-beaters from jumping the low-bar turnstiles, but the designs of the HEETs are just simply not user friendly.  Yes, it's to most people, simple and straight-forward since all you do is swipe your MetroCard, step straight ahead and push the bars forward, but of course, things can and do go wrong.  I personally didn't have any problems with it, but I had witnessed a number of people having trouble with it.  If you incorrectly push the wrong set of bars, the turnstiles won't work.  Or if you step into the wrong opening of the HEET (slightly left of center) the turnstile will rotate in the correct counter-clockwise direction, for a few feet, then it locks again.  Re-swiping your MetroCard because you thought it didn't read correctly without looking at the display, will charge you twice for one ride.  I learned afterwards that even regular/long-time riders will tell you to avoid the HEETs if possible and rather use the waist-heigh turnstiles if available.  In general, I would give one star for the Metro for being available to take you around from point A to point B and one star for the frequency and speed.  Though much more complicated (in terms of the sheer amount of the different lines/platforms), the JR subway system in Japan on the other hand, was to me, much more better overall.",mta

We got on the Red Line at the cavernous Civic Center/Grand Park station and took it nine stops to the evocative Hollywood/Vine station which features Art Deco palm trees and miles of empty film reels on the station ceiling. That part of the experience was kinda cool, but the train itself was well worn...There was a surly vibe to the onboarding passengers. After nine stops, I could see why. Random yelling. Bros chugging beers. Seniors left standing. Few masks. But there was no getting around the convenience or the bargain price point. Maybe because LA is all about the car culture, the subway didn't feel as indispensable as the NYC Metro.

But no, with a few hundred people on board, they mozy on off the train, have another person stroll on over and finish the last 15 minutes (1 mile) of the route.The trains themselves run every 20 minutes.

Just to waste everyone's time.It's swarming with drunks and homeless and the only thing the police are doing is checking whether the people rushing to their meeting in business suits paid the $1.75, oh thank heavens.The announcement system is basically random messages being played at random times about unrelated exits.I mean, it's a giant joke like out of some novel lampooning incompetence.

89,2,"Oct 5, 2018",PROS: 1. I'm very happy they're building up the rail system again. At least there will be a better system in the future to look forward to.2. Cheaper than Uber and Lyft.CONS:1. Very long wait times for both trains and buses. The Red and Purple Lines should run every 5 minutes at night not every 20 minutes. 20 minutes is a lot of wasted time especially if you just missed a train. Blue and Expo lines have better service frequency but the trains move too slowly in Downtown L.A. Buses often run only every 45-60 minutes on Melrose Ave. west of Vine Street. Poor service frequency on Robertson Blvd. where buses only run once an hour and shut down on weekends. I stopped using most buses because of the long wait times and short-line service (where some buses only go to Vine St. which makes the wait times for West Hollywood double.) Uber is far more reliable. The free tap card passes and the rail system are the only reasons why I still take Metro.2. Elevator and Escalator breakdowns are a major problem in Metro stations especially if you have a bike or are wheelchair bound. The Red and Purple line stations are huge and deep. It's not always possible to take the stairs.3. Some Metro vehicles are in bad condition. Red and Purple line trains need to be refurbished. The floors are falling apart and decals peeling off. Some buses are too old and need to be replaced. Don't just put new CNG tanks on a 15 year old bus and put it back in service. Order new buses.I would support increased sales taxes for service improvements because I know most of these problems are mainly funding related.,la

If this were rush hour between the hours of 5 and 6 pm, you'd be squished in like sardines. Lucky for you, it will be 2 am when you get on.- About 30 minutes from Union Station to the North Hollywood station. Super convenient to get around Downtown. - Watch out for drunken SantasBlue Line- You may want to say a little prayer before getting on. you'll need some divine intervention to make it from Downtown to Long Beach without being bothered by gangsters, potheads, grownups selling candy, homeless people, crazy people, preachers, and dudes with boomboxes....yah, they still exist.- About one hour-ish to Long Beach. Expect an excruciatingly painful stop in Downtown as you watch dozens of people walk past you while you don't go anywhere. Expo Line- Through Downtown to USC - Blue Line applies- Past USC to Culver City - Gold Line appliesGreen Line- Someone's going to have to update me on that one...All lines:- Teenagers may or may not be annoying- Stay safe. Don't be so drunk you don't know your surroundings, or at least travel with someone who does. Have fun and Happy New Year!",la

106,3,"Apr 26, 2013","For the one city where traffic is among the nation's worst, one would think more folks would use the LA Metro. It's not as clean as DC's metro system, as simple as Boston's, or as vast or cost effective NYC, but LA does a solid job for what it is. The trains run on time, they're not disgusting, and not terribly crowded even during rush hour.But people in these parts love to drive. The search for the nearest subway stop doesn't sound as appealing as the allure of a luxury valet. Safety is a concern for the late commuters, but if you don't bother anyone else, it's pretty unlikely they'd bother you. It also might stop in a popular area, but considering the urbal sprawl of the city, it's not exactly convenient with out the aid of a bus for the more rural areas.Then there is the TAP card. Day passes are still available and the per ride requirement can be bypassed with the honor system. Plenty of people have cheated their way past turnstyles and have taken advantage of the fact there is very little staff and/or onboard maintenance.

The Metro system takes riders all throughout Los Angeles County. Fee is $1.75 for a one way Trip. You can purchase a tap card for $1 which is reusable. Just load it with money before using! Day pass I believe is still $7 . back in the day, it was $5. I can understand with the inflation rate as to why it goes up. I have used just about every single bus line. Depending on the day or time, they usually run every 10 mins. During the weekends and the wee hours, they run a bit longer. Just about anywhere you want to go throughout Los Angeles, the Metro bus takes you there. This is my go to method whenever I choose to bar hop. I rather never drive while inebriated so just Metro bus it! The bus drivers can be from nice and chatty to just plain quiet! No eating or drinking is allowed on the bus inside.

108,3,"Apr 17, 2009","So I've lived in LA for a little over 3 years now. Long enough to claim residence in 4 zip codes (moving sucks) and soon to be a 5th(eh). Until recently, whether or not my commute was 5 blocks or 15 miles, I had always driven.When I moved to LA near South Pasadena I realized I was a short 5 minute ride to the Mission St. Metro stop. I wanted to try and use the line, but it wasn't until I started a new job in Hollywood where I was finally able to utilize it on a daily basis.  So far it has been great. I wake up at 7:30, shower and dress. By 8 am I am out the door and at the Mission St stop by about 8:15. It takes a minute to walk from where you park because it's 4 hour parking near the station to avoid a parking cluster.I always bring a book and my IPOD shuffle. I can usually  even find a seat. By about 8:30-40 I am at Union Station where I switch to the Red Line. I get to my stop at Hollywood/Vine at around 9 or so.  Then I have a nice 10 minute walk down to Santa Monica Blvd.It's been great! I save 50 bucks a week on gas, so now I don't mind eating out for lunch all the time. I also get a nice workout and have lost about 10 pounds in 2 weeks.Fortunately and unfortunately, I just signed a lease back in Hollywood (ironically near the Hollywood and Vince stop) BUT i will now be walking to work and still not paying for Gas--booyah!--HOWEVER--I gotta be fair and honest. Not all is kosher down under. The cliental that rides the tube is sketchy at best. I've gotten threatening looks from Cholos, almost puked because of a stinky hobo who stood too close to me, and had a few looney tunes start conversations with me. I could see how a woman might not feel comfortable alone. But from what I understand they have camera and a guard on every train.Give the metro a look. Even if you can't take it to work, you can probably find a route you can use. For example I plan on walking to the Hollywood and Vince spot and taking it to the Sunset/Vermont stop to go out in Los Feliz where I have some friends.

143,2,"Feb 21, 2013","Dear Los Angeles Metro,I thought it would be fun to use public transportation for the day.  I see people do it on TV all the time.  However, it turned out that you are confusing as hell.  I was left fending for myself trying to figure out how you work.  So I bought myself a TAP card.  I was wondering if I can share a card and swipe it twice or do I need a card per person?  There was no one there for me to ask.  I had no clue where to swipe my card.  I saw someone swiping and I told my friend I think that round  thing is where you swipe.  She thought it was where you check to see how much money you have left.  She said I'm sure there is a turn stile that you tap to get through.  I asked a stranger that walked by,  he said just get on.  He never pays.  No one ever check on the weekend.  As tempting as it sounds, do I want to take that chance?  Failure to pay you can get fine up to $250 and 48 hours community service. Its only 1.50 to ride the metro, that's pocket change.   So I have my tap card, charged and ready to go.  Then I turned to my friend and asked  how do we know if we were going on the right train?  hmmm no one working to ask.  All I know is that I needed to take the gold line.  So I turned to some random stranger and said, ""Hey!  Where are you going?""  This lady said union station, I told her i was too and so we followed her like creepers.  I find it funny how ever time I asked a stranger where they were going they never hesitate to tell me.  I guess i'm not that suspicious looking.  I got on the metro.  made my way to the union station with my TAP card and all.  So it turned out that I meant to pay for my trip, but I never TAP my card because I'm clueless. That round thing that I saw  that was next to the TAP vending machine was where you were suppose to TAP. I actually played with it trying to figure out what it was for. I didn't know I was suppose to tap my card there.  It doesn't make sense.   I'm going to stick to driving, but I am still praying for teleportation.",la

Just a open way for people to go in and out freely WITHOUT paying. Whaaaaaa...So people are mooching off the metro system... The money for the fees goes to taking care of the station. Are you kidding me that people can just get away with it? It's $3 for a round trip... And it goes to taking care of this metro... You seriously going to jip the system for $3.

You do KNOW that the metro goes to all the major LA cities which could be dangerous targets!!! Seriously! Wtf LA metro! We need security pronto and gated systems!This is embarrassing compared to all the other metro stations in the US. Thailand, a third world country, has a better metro system than you!!!There needs to be tighter security and actual paid gates to go through... How else are you going to take care of this system!? The honor system sucks! You're losing money! Seriously?!The metro did its job- Point A to Point B. it seriously is convenient but omg...But as a taxpayer and actually follows the honor system, I'm sooooo disappointed in this system and metro. It really discourages the honest people from even paying if no one else is paying. Yeah, there are cops there but not all the time...

The bus operators are rude and most times can be very nasty. Trains are never on time and just the other night I was stuck on the red line for 20 minutes and the conductor (if you can call them that) never said one word as to what was going on or when the train would move again. The cost to ride metro is far too much and TAP is a huge joke. Half the time my card never even give me the green ""enter"" light to get on. Even though it gets loaded every month.Security on METRO is the worst. In fact there is no such thing. The only thing I;ve ever seen the so called security or police do is write out tickets. Making sure the stations are safe and secure is not their number one priority. In fact I dont think it is a priority at all.The whole ""see something say something"" is nothing more then a poor attempt to make people feel safe. Who the heck are you supposed to say something to? There are no agents. Then they give you a number to call the police, but that is no good when you're underground.I've been on the Red, Blue and now the Expo Lines when fights have broken out. It takes the train operator forever to even answer the call button.If you ever try to use their trip planer it gives you routes that take forever. For example I wanted to get to Malibu from Hollywood. It had me walk 4 blocks down to Sunset to get the 2 or 302 and then transfer to the 217 or 780 to Venice and Fairfax to get the 534 to Malibu. I could have just taken the 2 or 302 to PCH and caught the 534 to Malibu, but this was not an option.Santa Monica Municipal Bus Line (Big Blue Bus) is far superior to Metro. Their buses are on time, clean, safe and the drivers are friendly and very helpful. I was so happy when Big Blue Bus introduced the 7 Rapid to the Wilshire and Western Station. I wish they could run buses to Hollywood where I live. But I will soon be back in Santa Monica where I will never have to ride metro unless I want to",la

Just now it cost me a ticket on Amtrak that I pre-paid for, since the 10 bus decided not show up at all to go to Union Station. Yes, I absolutely made sure I had the right bus, bus stops, and times. Maybe L.A. Metro has something against Santa Monica? Hey, I can't help it if it the air is better here.What a bummer. If I can't depend on a bus system to get me where I need to go at the time I need to get there, why would I ever want to use it?

Getting the 20 miles from our home in Woodland Hills to Hollywood can take anywhere from 30 minutes to and hour and a half... and you never know which to expect. So, when we go to the Pantages or El Cap to see a show, we just always leave 90 minutes (or more!) ahead. Getting to the Dorothy Chandler can take up to 2 hours. Then you have to find a spot to park the car and pay about $12 for the privilege.We've been eyeing the Warner Transportation Center and the Metro Orange Line for some time as a possible alternative. So, this past Monday we decided to ride it all the way to Union Station (which includes a transfer in N. Hollywood to the Metro Red Line) and get some Cielito Lindo taquitos to celebrate Cinco De Mayo.Buying tickets is easy. The machine is intuitive and accepts cash, coins and cards. One way is $1.25. An all day pass is $5. Metro Orange Line buses leave about every 8-10 minutes or so. They're comfortable enough, though not plush. The ride from Woodland Hills to N. Hollywood took about 40 minutes. The transfer to the Red Line was painless and the ride from N. Hollywood to Union Station took another 35 minutes for a total 1 hour 15 minutes from Woodland Hills to Union Station. That is about the same time it would take in a car! Plus, I didn't have to find and pay for parking when I got there. Frankly, unless we need the car to get around once we get downtown, I don't see any reason to not take the Metro. It's just as fast, and with the price of gasoline and parking... CHEAPER!We need to visit a friend in Long Beach soon. I think we can take the Metro all the way in about 2 hours for $1.25 per person each way.

Unfortunately, West LA is not served very well by Metro trains, so you would need to take buses to get there. And there lies the problem. Some routes take far too long. To save time, look for Metro Rapid Service buses to shave some time off. At least they have routes that have 24 hour service if you need it.

180,3,"Oct 10, 2011","Growing up in the Bay Area, I was fortunate enough to experience the awesomeness that is Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART). If it's going to an Oakland A's game or hitting up a show at Maritime Hall...BART was usually the way to go when it came to a non-driving option. LA's version of BART, the multifaceted LA Metro system holds some water when comparing the two public transit systems. Although that glass isn't too big when looking to fill it. I've taken Metro's Blue Line from Long Beach to LA / Hollywood quite a few times for several anti-war protests and most recently, Occupy LA at City Hall. I've never had a problem with Metro as a service itself. The act of transferring from the light rail Blue Line to the BART-like Red Line at 7th Street is really easy, even when my most recent experience included a portion of the Blue Line being shut down for some construction issues, Metro staff made the task of finding the shuttle bus and knowing where to go quite pleasant. I've also never really experienced any time delays with service either. Now if I relied on Metro to get to and from work, riding it daily, I might have a different opinion. With that being said, there are a few things I feel I must address. First of all, with the exception of a few LA Sheriff Officers patrolling stations (mainly making sure people have tickets), security seems a little sparse. Especially on the trains. Being how anyone can essentially ride Metro without a ticket...this leaves for people to take advantage of the situation. I think this is mainly as issue I've seen on the Blue Line. Let's not beat around the bush, the Blue Line goes through some pretty sketchy areas. This leads me to my next talking point...while there's a station right next to The Staples Center, I wouldn't take The Blue Line to a Laker's night game. Rolling through Compton at 11:30 PM doesn't sound like a good time to me. At least when I was on BART coming home from a show in San Francisco...I know that BART Police are on guard. Lastly, the idea that So. Cal doesn't have an area wide public transit system is quite sad. Nothing going into Orange County from LA County. They really need to expand Metro's service to neighboring counties and communities...like BART has in the Bay Area. Metro is a nice way to get into the LA / Hollywood area without driving...especially for day trips. Beyond that, unless you have more balls than I, it's ONLY for day trips. Otherwise it's a decent system.",la

For the most part, people are pretty friendly, but you get some peculiar people who look like ex-cons or homeless who want to talk to you onboard, but that is something that is beyond Metro's control.And I agree with some of the bad reviews who make the claim there are no instructions on how to board or attendant helping out.  You'll have to do your research online on how to take it and through trial and error.  That is just how you learn and once you get used to it, it is a pretty convenient way of getting around.",la
182,3,"Jun 29, 2008","I am SUCH a fan of public transportation. I can't speak for how the Metro runs during the week, but on the weekend the metro from Glendale is sadly inefficient. Although the station is pretty and the hedges are trimmed and it has this manicured feel, the trains don't run very frequently (and are often late). Plus, it's about 6 bucks for a roundtrip ticket to Union Station. And it's hard if you take the train in during the day and want to stay later into the night (the last train back to Glendale on Saturday was at 9PM...Seriously!). There was an article in the LA times recently about taking the metro late night, well, 9PM is NOT late night people. No way. Still. I can wish, can't I? The Glendale station is within walking distance from my apartamento, so I really, really WANT to take the metro, but not if the trains run irregularly and the round trip ticket is more than three bucks. That's just silly. Still. I like public transportation. I really, really do. I'm not going to give up on LA's yet...I can only hope it will improve in the future. If I lived downtown; however, I would definitely take the metro to get where I want to go. From Union Station we took the red line to Pershing Square and it was pretty efficient.",la

The Gold Line is my favorite maybe because of the air conditioning.,la

I've taken the red line from Studio City to Hollywood a couple of times and the bus service that runs on Ventura and neither were bad or delayed. They were clean too. I've also taken the red line and purple line downtown. That was ok. However, the signs were lacking for direction at the Wilshire/Westlake station. I wasn't sure what platform to be on or which stairs to take to get to what train. I ended up following someone I overheard talking about what train they were taking. The buses are pretty straight forward. Pick a stop, read the map, trace your path to where you want to go, switch buses if needed. I haven't gotten the hang of the timing of the buses yet but I will. Easy to transfer to the trains too since the buses meet up with their stops. Also, the TAP card is nice in that you can just add money to it without buying a pass.

For any L.A. visitor, all you'll need to navigate your way through the trains is a bit of research, possibly a smartphone/navigator or simply put that aside and grab a map and a compass and you're good to go! My parents and I opted to do things the old fashion way. We were on vacation and wanted to be away from technology as much as possible. We hopped on the gold and silver lines on the first day, tried the red and purple lines the next day and ended our vacation with the expo line to Culver City. All trains arrived promptly. Had a fun time at the purple line when this one guy got up his chair and called out to everyone else that he had a 'snoop doggy dog' song tucked under his sleeve. Without hesitation, he began to rap - to the annoyance of some commuters. I found it hilarious! He ended his song with a short speech about how he need some 'Mickey D's' and proceeded to ask for tips! We had to get off the next station just as he was about to start another Johnny Cash song. He ought to be doing that around Vegas, don't you think?",la
195,2,"Oct 4, 2017",LA is too spread out so the metro doesn't go everywhere.  They are adding more lines so that is good.  If you want to take certain lines there's no parking and the lines that have parking available charge a fee.  Buying a round trip ticket is not clear on the screen.  You have to look up above over your head on the ticketing machine for some instructions and then look down at the screen.  This makes the line long as many people who don't ride it regularly don't know what to do.  Why not have all instructions on the screen where everyone is looking.  With time perhaps improvements will be made.,la

We then used the Metro subway for much of our travel the next few days.I was pleasantly surprised (after reading some reviews).  After a small learning curve with the Tap system, we found our train which was better marked than other systems I have used (NYC, BART).  The subway was reasonably clean.  We had stops right across from our downtown hotel (the Sheraton) and where we wanted to mainly go (Hollywood & Highland).My only gripe was why they don't police if people are paying the fare?!?!?  We saw dozens of people easily walk right past the turnstiles without paying.  This added to crowded trains and, in my opinion, invited individuals who didn't care at all about their fellow riders.  My wife and I did get checked for tickets once...on our return trip to Union Station.  Enforce the fare and use the funds to maintain the cars, security and keep sufficient capacity.Otherwise I was very happy with LA's subway system.",la

The Los Angeles area is definetly NOT pedestrian friendly, TAXIs will cost you more than almost anything else on your trip.  So on one of the days, we decide to use the Metro, as a way to snub our nose at the taxis fares.... until we realize that we have to take a taxi to the metro station from our hotel.... 10.00.  Then we arrive at a green line station... okay no problem, looks like our BART system...kik ass... until we go to buy tickets, of the 4 machines, none are working 100% as they will not take credit cards... although when working properly they do.  Its 1.25 to ride the system, cheaper than BART... hmmm maybe they have something here... up to the platform, no display to tell you how long to wait..... what seems like forever, a MUNI like train pulls up, which being near the endline is now almost full.  The trains are narrow and slow.  We ride that to the Blue line transfer, where we go down stairs into a very seedy neighborhood where we have to wait for the blue train under the overheard line of the green line..... not if you'll get mugged, but when....  the blue line pulls up, jam packed, and the BO smell is nauseating.  The train is slow, very slow... oh shit, get me off the thing, there are about 40 people on here, that have not showered in a week.  At the red line transfer, the system looks more like our Bart, as the train is longer to accommodate more people, but filthy..... the stench of the passengers is more tolerable, but you feel like you need a shower after the whole ride, and it takes so long, I don't know how anyone could use the system efficiently.  For a city so large, and in California, I was expecting more from it.

206,3,"Aug 2, 2009","I've been using the MTA ever since arriving here some decade and a half ago from the east coast and I must say that the transportation system that they have here in the west coast is inferior to what they have in the east coast. In any case, not much can be helped. After a little over 15 years of riding the Metro, I can honestly say that many of the comments that were made by reviewers here are accurate. Buses: They never arrive on the time they are supposed to arrive so the timetables that you see on those pieces of paper? Don't rely on them. Use them as a guide. If it is says it'll arrive at 8:15am, it'll be plus or minus 30 minutes. So always arrive at least thirty minutes early from the time that the bus is ""supposed"" to arrive so that you don't miss it in case if it comes early--because the bus drivers don't give a rats ass if they are ""on schedule"" or not. Bus Drivers: A lot of the bus drivers don't know LA very much or the cities which their bus route is on. They only know the ""general"" bus route that they are supposed to go. That's it. If you're a newcomer to commuting by bus, you have a 50/50 chance that they can or cannot help you. And don't expect them to know which buses you need to transfer to once you get off the bus. A lot of them simply don't know, some don't really care, and the rest are just disgruntled bus drivers and they'll purposefully try to get you lost just because they had a bad day. I've had it happened to me too many times to remember in the 15 years I've been using the Metro. Also, if the bus driver doesn't see you at the stop, he or she will drive past it without stopping. So be visible at the stop and extend your arm out to signal to the bus driver that you want to board that bus. Metro Rail: Out of all the negatives I've pointed out so far, the rail has never disappointed me. They are generally quite consistent. They usually take something like 15-25 minutes to arrive at each station. You should get to the station at least 10 minutes early from the time the rail is supposed to arrive. Oh, and it's not unusual to find a few crackheads, hookers, hobos, drug dealers, and crazy people on board the rail at any given time. So if you're a female riding the train alone, I'd suggest standing or sitting near other regular people for your own safety and do carry plenty of pepper spray. Better yet, bring a stun gun. =DUnion Station: Don't use the restrooms in the main hall. If you have to go badly, use the restroom at the very back of the building after you past the hallway where all the trains are located at. That's probably the only restroom I know about that is remotely clean and not a lot of people use. The other ones at the main hall are a garbage dump--literally. Be prepared to smell a whiff of human fecal matter, trash, sewage, and other unpleasant smells. It's hobo heaven in there. Also, guard your belongings. Theft is common here. There are so many people coming in and out of this place that almost everyone appear as if they are running away from something. Oh, and if you're going to walk into the hallway where the trains are located at, be prepared because people there will literally elbow you or shove you out of their way to get to their destination. If you have to walk through there, walk fast in any single direction. All in all, if you don't have a car, or you're trying to save money, or if you just want to get from point A to point B and time isn't an important factor, then the Metro will do just that. Just don't expect great customer service, reliability, or consistency.",la

LA Metro, one of the largest public transportation providers in the Nation, does not care to inform nor to educate its riders and customers, about the needs of the dissabled.

This is not to much to ask, unless you happen to be unfortunate enough to need to travel via LA Metro. They expect the handicapped to hold on tight for dear life, rather than institute an informational and educational program to emphasized the obvious needs of the handicapped.

The movie Crash made it clear that the Los Angeles driving population is lonely. The hours I spend in my car each day are void of any human interaction. The Los Angeles Metro system has restored my faith in human connection! The metro is slow, and its stops are limited, but it is a chance to talk to fellow humans. Over the course of my few metro rides I have had a number of riveting conversations and exchanges.

We chatted amiably about the possibility of a bomb exploding in the train and burning us to bits. We giggled the whole way! I imaging you could meet your true love on the metro.

221,1,"Jul 26, 2012","I did not start taking the Metro until 2008. Not surprisingly, I'm now officially over it.Beginning in 2010, I started taking Metro buses and Rail everywhere since I didn't have a license and I began going to college. I pretty much am on MTA every single day. All I have to say to summarize my experiences: varied and inconsistent. Sometimes buses come too early or too late. I've had times when I was just across the street or down from an arrival and they left even though the listings cited they were not coming for another 5 minutes. Then there are some buses that can be as late as 20 minutes or don't show up at all.Twice a bus driver snapped at me, ""What does that mean? I don't understand."" because I told them I didn't have enough change. Well yes, this isn't a special needs class. I mean what I say. The policy of exact change is annoying. I've either put in too much or too little a handful of times. They need a change machine or something.Some drivers are bitchy, some are rude, some are kind, some are happy. You never know what you're going to get. I've had drivers that were maps of the area, and others that wouldn't even answer me. I'm paying you... do your job right. I asked one if they got interviews and training and he said yes. Another said they just get so bored doing the same thing over and over. Actually, your job is easier than many others... you operate a ride for everybody even though it does get old.Also, I heard that many drivers drive way too fast. Often, handicapped people fall out of the weak straps. When I was younger I noticed the bus did not offer better securement, which did prove to be a problem. No seat belts. One time I was on Hollywood and Western and one elderly man actually fell because the driver sped away when he was trying to sit down. The top of his head cracked open and bled, driver wasn't allowed to drive for some time, and an ambulance came while we all got on another bus. Everyone talked about lawsuits.Anybody can ride a bus or train, and that includes homeless people. Not specific to LA but a lot of people have mental issues and don't drive. Yep, you'll see them on here. Drivers aren't allowed to kick them off since they scrape up the greens (only $1.50) or they beg their way in. Don't be surprised if you see people asking you out or asking for money during your ride. Disturbing? Distracting? Yeah, I know.Everyone screaming that Metro helps combat traffic, not really. Some parts of Koreatown, Downtown, and West LA are still pretty bad especially after the mornings. Appointments become more of a problem. I am in no way biased, I have friends who live in DTLA and Pasadena and they rely soly on the Metro system to get around. If you're lucky enough to have such systems closer to you, you can get anywhere in under 20 minutes. The only good thing is that this gets you to places and you don't have to park.",la
222,1,"Jul 20, 2008","last night we waited at the bus stop at sunset/alvarado for a good 45 minutes for the number 4 bus to take us to santa monica.  we had checked it out online before walking to the bus stop and it said that there'd be a bus every 10-15 minutes, so we weren't all too concerned about getting there on time.i called the 800 number, navigated my way thru the touch-tone system so that i could ask an operator specifically what time the bus would be there, and after 10 minutes of ""press one......press two......"" i finally get there and get to listen to a recording saying ""we are sorry, the los angeles metro operator system is closed....""  sweeeet.so we got over it, gave up on taking the bus, and started walking back to a friends' house.  and of course, as we were walking away, the bus pulls up.  we wave it down, and it takes the bus driver at least a minute or two to even get the door open.  and by that time we had already committed to not going, so we watched the bus drive away and drunkenly stumbled back to the house.eff tha metro!btw!this was my 100th review!woooo!",la
223,1,"Sep 21, 2016","My review is only for the expo line. I gave LA metro a chance to avoid the stress by the LA rush hours from downtown to the west side. Unfortunately, riding the metro is more stressful, more expensive and less convenient. Not enough trains. Never on schedule. I dont recommend metro as an alternative to commute specially to your job. Hopefully the problem will be fixed, or else metro is a waste of time, money and energy. I am back riding my car to my job. Traffic is still bad but still much better than metro. LA metro FAIL",la
224,3,"Nov 11, 2012","This is for mainly for 2 (Sunset Blvd), 4 (Santa Monica Blvd), 20 (Wilshire Blvd) lines which are the primary santa monica to downtown and everything in betweenLine 2 is the best. Quiet, scenic route, mostly latina housekeepers working in the westside and a few homeless beach bums. At least till you get to hollywood. All in all this is the quietest major bus line and is a pleasure to be on. It does run less than the others though, good luck catching an eastbound bus after 7 pm and a westbound bus after 9 pm...Line 4 is a mix of Latino workers who staff most of downtown santa monica and a huge number of homeless and druggies. Most of the UCLA/young professional types go on Big Blue Bus, so Line 4 is a little rough. Once you get to WeHo more gays and trannies come on. Plus some Silverlake alterative types. Late at night Line 4 is literally a homeless shelter on wheels. This is the most consistent owl service bus too, it keeps a 20 minute schedule even at 2 or 3 am.Line 20 along Wilshire is the worst. Far too overcrowded all the time. Wilshire Blvd passes through the densest parts of LA, and all kinds of people are on this bus. Workers, students, homeless, professionals, housekeepers. You'll have trouble getting a seat unless you get on the first couple stops.LA Public transport is not too good, but I'm OKAY with it because it's cheap and accessible,t hough highly unreliable.If you work a typical rush hour job (somewhere around 9-5) I would NOT rely on the bus. There are far too many inconsistencies with timing, seating, traffic, bizarre operator behavior where you can't expect to get to work on time unless you plan super early.If you are on a leisurely visit or have time to kill, the bus is a great way to get around, especially if you catch a Rapid (starts with 700) since they only go to major intersections.The majority of bus riders are homeless at night. They keep to themselves, but if you are disturbed by ranting and yelling, getting up and wandering around the bus, and awful smells, you might not like the bus.Also a lot of crack and meth addicts ride it during the day and talk to themselves.So ultimately if you have time to kill (or get to a stop way before you're supposed to) and don't mind hangin with the homeless 2 feet away with you the bus is a viable option. I'd only use it for leisurely experiences -. Too unreliable for work, even the worst traffic jam in a car is gonna beat the bus.EDIT: If you have a smartphone, get one of the apps like TransitLA or ""Where is my LA Metro Bus"" because they GPS track the buses. For the most part they have been accurate down to the minute (unless a bus driver effs up and ditches). If you have to be somewhere, you can pretty well rely on this tracker.",la

If you have the misfortune to beold, absent minded or just possibly preoccuppied and lose your TAP (fare) card-you are going to be in for a series of decents into Hades........untilyou LEARN what the rules are for replacing your card: and I dont meanjust getting a temporary replacement at either Union Station orla Brea and Wilshire.  That part is easy. It's what happens afterwards:FIRST, let me tell you that unlike CITI RIDE, TAP2GO DOES actuallyanwer their phones and they are open at 7am.  In general, the peoplewho work there, know what they are doing BUT they left out someKEY information: IF youlose your card and get a replacement, youhave to call CITI RIDE and let them know that the previous card,which perhaps you 'loaded' for a month or 6 months' worth ofrides is NO LONGER VALID! Don't expect them to make the necessary adjustments.   Second, IF YOU want to talk toCITI-RIDE you MUST CALL at 8:01 AM and be prepared towait-they are seriously UNDERSTAFFED and that is justfor starters. ANd dont try to get them for the first l4days of the month.  ONCE you have established that you will need a NEW CITI RIDE BUS CARD ,you must then realize that you haveto check with TAP2Go once CITI RIDE has mailed youthe card,to make sure that CITI RIDE loaded the CORRECT card. LEt'snot get started on the various errors that were made involvingmy replacement card, my old card (which was returned in themail-but since I had cancelled it when I bought a replacementcard, it was not good, etcetc)  It is something like navigatingthe rings of Hades to get it all straightened out-the one thingthat is good is that Tap2Go has email, so yu can at least voiceyour frustrations and get a response.   CITIRIDE is anothergovernment funded institution that has no respect for itscustomers and obviously recruits employees who have nounderstanding of what it is they are doing-whichI thoughtwas to serve the public, especially Seniors.  I have almostno hair left after my recent exerperiences, but at least I nowknow that the next card I lose (And it's inevitable), will be a sign that I should stop using public trasnportation and buy a car.It will be far less challenging.",la

They board or are already on the train and they walk down the aisles asking to see your card and they scan it to see if you paid your fare.

233,3,"Jul 13, 2012","I would say that I don't know why more people don't utilize the LA Metro system but prior to using it for the first time about a year and a half ago I never used it because I just never even thought about it. I'm usually traveling with other people and just always assume we're driving but last year I was attending a outdoor concert a few miles south east of downtown LA and when we realized it would be impossible and extremely expensive to park there we decided to take the Metro from another station past downtown. We drove and met up with our friends at their hotel by a station, each paid a low fee and road the train in from there. Very easy and not at all unpleasant. Much cheaper than driving, less stressful and honestly I think we saved time because we didn't sit in any of the bumper to bumper traffic waiting to park and what not. Exiting was a little more crowded but efficient. Like I said, I just never even thought about using the LA metro but now that I have I usually use it every opportunity that I can. Especially if you're going out with your friends and might be drinking so you don't can't drive...much cheaper than a taxi. Something we should all start using more often.",la
234,4,"Jul 27, 2007","Not sure if this is the correct listing for the entire LA Metro system as the address listed is in Chinatown but this seems to be the closest I'm going to get.  To those of you used to the public transport systems of NY, the two don't really compare.  LA is a huge city and not meant to be traversed on foot like NY is.   However, I do find it handy when traveling to places like Hollywood and Highland or to the Pantages. While I wish there were more Metro stops (i.e. along the Westside), they do have enough to enable me to take it about once or twice a week up to LA since I have a stop near my workplace.  One complaint that I do have is that they don't run as frequently as I would like them to, especially at night.  They've raised prices recently for the All-Day Pass, which used to be $3 but now is $5.  Each one-way is $1.25.  I don't suggest riding without a ticket, although they don't check most of the time.  However, when they do check, they often do it by the exits, esp. at the Hollywood/Vine and Hollywood/Highland stops.  It's a pretty steep fee if you're caught: $250 fine and I think 200 hours of community service.  And if you don't have proper ID with you, they'll handcuff you and take you to the station -- I've seen this happen plenty of times.  I've ridden it late at night, which I don't really recommend bc the trains are fairly empty, but nothing has happened to me....yet.  I definitely recommend taking the Metro when you have the chance!  It's saved me money and, once in a while, time - it's faster than driving through all that LA traffic.",la
235,1,"Jul 8, 2012","I've used public transportation in Los Angeles for about 6 years now and I'll still say it sucks. Yeah using it will save you gas money but then again trains/buses are so slow and for a trip that's usually 45 minutes by car it will take you 2 hours or more to get to your destination. To top it off, most bus drivers are so rude, especially if you're on the orange line. I've seen them shut the door on people so many times and they'll be right outside the door too.. I just don't see how they can be so rude. If it weren't for the people using the bus they wouldn't have their job so they should be more polite and professional. I've used the Blue Line, Red Line, and Green Line, and so far the Blue Line is the only one I'll say that's horrible. It's usually always dirty and smells bad. A lot of the seats are broken too. Last thing I'll mention is that there are times when you'll be on any Metro bus and out of nowhere in the middle of your bus ride the driver decides to take a break so you gotta be waiting for them and then your bus ride will continue. If anything they should take a break before or after the bus ride instead of making people late. With that said, I only give one start to LA Metro because it's gotten me to places but it doesn't deserve any more stars because it's service is horrible.",la

3,4,"Jan 7, 2023","I refuse to compare the Chicago ""L"" to the New York City subway. I will not. To do that is literally comparing an apple to an orange and that simply is not fair.What I will do is praise the heck out of this system. It is clean, safe, reliable, and extensive. Those are my only similarities between the ""L"" and the subway. After that, things vary, and not just because most of the system is above ground, hence the ""L"" nickname.I found most people on the trains respectful. Not many panhandlers, and the rule about no bikes on the trains during peak hours is strictly enforced. I was on a train where a cyclist tried boarding with a bike and the motorman announced ""No bikes during rush hour."" To enforce this, the train would not move until the cyclist disembarked. That would never happen in New York City.Once you get the hang of it, navigating around the Loop is rather easy and fun. There are plenty of lines to pick from, and they all pretty much get you where you need to go downtown. Once they branch off the loop, some of the lines run express outside downtown, making it even easier to get around.From a railfans' perspective, it is an absolute delight. I found a parking garage that overlooks Tower 18 and you could easily spend several hours watching trains traverse this intersection. It is like watching vehicle traffic as trains stop to allow other trains to pass by or merge onto another track. Sometimes you can see up to four trains come together! It felt like a model train display being brought to life.I could also talk about METRA, but that is for another review.",cta

If you have a complaint call the station directly and ask for a Manager. (You can find the numbers by looking at the Lost and Found numbers on their website). To the person who said white neighborhoods get quicker service..no..all neighborhoods have terrible service..partially due to them being understaffed. And to the person in O.P. saying the homeless are along the tracks? You must mean outside the tracks. That's not CTA property. Sadly seeing homeless in big cities and nearby burbs comes with territory. I noticed you have another review complaining about the homeless..maybe a major urban area is not for you. Just sayin.​,cta

We couldn't figure out the machine and she didn't think twice about coming over and helping us. Then she shared a trick with the zip code for out of towners, and told us to not use our debit card while were in the city.

The ride was smooth for the most part and it was not crowded both times we rode. The train is on a platform downtown and it was strange to ride between buildings and be able to look into someone's room since we were so close. It feels like the buildings press against the train. When we got out, we made our way through the turnstile and down to the street. On the return, we found a station and took the stairs up and went through the turnstiles. There are elevators if you need. And the signage tells you which side of the platform you need to be on depending on your route.

I have dubbed his run as ""The Barron Express."" Secondly I mention Cynthia of the Brown Line. The energy and cheer that she provides is out of this world. I think that she was born of another planet! Thirdly I mention Kevin of the Brown Line. He is a hunk who operates skillfully and kindly. I am grateful to these divine humans who take me where I need to go! Oh, and I love the CTA so muchly that I don a CTA hat in the wintertime (see picture). Thank you, CTA!",cta
35,1,"Dec 13, 2021","I was taking a friend from Florida all around the city and he was excited to ride the CTA and we bought a single ride pass which we is suppose to give you two transfers within two hours. Well every time we tried too use the transfers well within two hours it would not let us through saying it expired!!!!Plus we kept seeing smelly people sleeping all over the trains or people smoking several times or people rapping loudly a few times or yelling!Suddenly his excitement for the CTA and us riding it for 3 weeks went away as we could not count on it and it seemed silly to have to keep spending 3 dollars to get back on the trains and buses after only one hour especially when it claims you have two hours in which to use two transfers! And to do so with the sleeping, smoking, rapping, etc we kept encountering!On top of all of that there are always people bugging me for MY money and not taking no for an answer and people blaring their crap music.If the CTA is going to announce that things like talking on the phone, radio playing and smoking and demanding my money is not allowed then they need to enforce those rules!  As every single time I am on the CTA someone is on the phone being loud, playing music loud and always demanding I give them money and all the other things mentioned!Even now with new reduced fares which is great!  But due to all of the above I am not so anxious to take advantage of it sadly. The CTA like the rest of the city cannot control the endless bad pathetic behavior of so many in this city!",cta

There aren't really ways to get from one end of town to another in such a speedy way as the subway in New York City, and London also has a better subway system than anything on offer in Chicago.

It was normal to wait at least 10 minutes for the next train. Also, there is a good amount of homeless people sleeping on the trains, with some cars smelling so bad, it was impossible to stay in them. Speaking of cleanliness, it did not appear that these trains are cleaned much, as the inside of most of them had plenty of wear and stains.",cta

43,3,"Feb 6, 2019","The CTA and I have what I would call a love, hate relationship. When it's running smoothly and I happen to catch a good cart on the train, I'm the definition of a happy camper. Those days when everything is delayed and the cart smells so bad I almost get sick, I curse to the high heavens and dream of teleportation. I'm about to get really real here. You ready?Also, heads up. I must point out that the majority of my experience utilizing the CTA is with the train system, most particularly the Blue Line. While I've ridden other lines and the bus a number of times, I lived off the Blue Line for about three years and knew it pretty well. The upside - I love that the CTA has an app and that you can use to add value to your transit card while on the go. The machines they have at each stop are fine and fairly easy to use but using the app is the most convenient. The app will also tell you about arrivals, delays, etc. Their operators are real humans. They have bad days but they also good days, like the rest of us. If you're lucky you'll get a super friendly or even a singing operator. It always brightened my morning and I want to give that specific fella a shout out. I don't know if you're still there but you're awesome. The downside - Depending on the line you ride, the carts and the train itself can be outdated. The Blue Line specifically seems to be a really outdated. It always has less room and is visibly older than others, like the Red Line. The Blue Line is also one of the only 24-hour trains and while that may seem like a perk, be mindful of the time that you're riding it. You'll have folks keeping cover over night when the weather is bad or when they have no place else to go. Pro tip - If you're around during the holidays try and catch the holiday train. It's cute. Solid three stars CTA, thanks for your service.",cta
44,1,"Jun 13, 2022",CTA is the worse run public transportation in the country!  It's loaded with homeless and drug addict's.  If taking to ORD in the morning hours it can take up to a hour to go three stops.  That doesn't include homeless jumping on the tracks to delay the trains.  Medical emergencies happen a few time a week which delay the passengers and ORD worker's to be late for flights and lose time from work!  This has been happening for at least 2 years!

Seeing so many negative things here about Ventra, the CTA and such all I can say is the citizens of Chicago that are customers of the CTA and Ventra... as bad as you think you have it be happy you don't have to rely on the TTC.I like the CTA and I'll tell you why:-The CTA is NOT the most expensive city transit to use in North America (Toronto is based on cost of passes, basically the foundation of your ridership)-The CTA doesn't get ripped off by fares in a sense of having an automatic payment system whether Ventra or Tap and Pay using your own bank/debit/credit card etc.-The CTA has 2 x 24 hours subway lines (red and blue)-The CTA has 2 airports served by CTA rail system (in Toronto we don't even have one TTC train service our main airport and the other airport is on an island)-The CTA has a wide rail coverage system over a vast area in 2 subway lines and 4 to 6 elevated lines depending on how you want to count the Brown/Purple/Red/Yellow extensions in the North.-The CTA has a lower ridership than Toronto but about double the quantity of rapid transit (subway/elevated train) stations than Toronto and can charge LESS to operate the system.My wife and I spent the last 5 days in Chicago and were either walking or using the CTA and over the entire 5 days because we bought 7 days passes it cost us a combined 56 dollars in CTA fares using Ventra.  This included a ride back and forth from O'Hare airport multiple bus rides all over, the L etc.  One cab ride from O'Hare to Magnificent Mile would have cost more than 56 dollars.

That's the bus closest to me, with other routes requiring I take multiple buses. There weren't any buses even appearing on the bus tracker until 6:15, and that one was listed as 28min away. I tried to catch the closest alternative to my destination but that one also had a 27min wait. I finally took the long route, via train and a connecting bus - and yes, that connecting bus was a 21min wait. When I boarded the bus, fully a third of the people were griping about how they had to take this alternative because the #6 never came. Damned shame. This is not just a complaint about a slow bus, this is an egregious slap in the face of south side travelers in the Hyde Park district. The #6 has an unsavory reputation for not showing, ghosting, and for afternoon (3-4pm), evening (8-9pm), nighttime and early morning ghosting. The bus schedules are on a fictional level with Tolkein.

Visiting Europeans or residents of East Asia might beg to differ, and sure, it's not London or Paris or Hong Kong or Tokyo or Seoul. But the coverage, in and of itself, is pretty good.

65,4,"Jul 10, 2016","My 800th. review will be dedicated to an agency that provides mobility for me to ""yelp"" around the city: Chicago Transit Authority.  I've been using CTA religiously for the past three (3) years ever since I moved to Chicago from a small town America that everyone there owns at least two (2) cars, one (1) truck, and one (1) John Deer.  It felt so good to be back in a major city where I can do my thang without having to be vehicle-dependent.  Riding CTA isn't just to commute to/from work for me; it's my life style.  I put my $100 CTA/Pace monthly premium pass to work on my days off.  I ride busses and ""L"" to get to places.  I sometimes invite my hubby along with the ride.  Yes, I'm hangin"" out the passenger ride, of my bestie CTA's ride, but I'm hollering at no one...just wanting to enjoy my own solitude.  CTA and I's relationship isn't always peachy.  Often times waiting for busses or trains can be an excruciating experience, especially in the brutal winter season.  Yet what else can I do?  Bundle up, dress in layers, listen to some K-pop, and start dancing with it to keep my body temperature stable.  For the most part trains and busses are ""on-time.""  After all it's public transportation.  You always want to plan ahead, know the bus schedule somewhat, and familiarize yourself with the immediate surroundings (i.g. the closest place for bathroom, the nearest coffee shop, and the most convenient take-out restaurant for a quick bite).  Most bus drivers, train operators, and station employees seem nice and helpful.  Of course they have their ""moments,"" just like every other human being living the in the universe.  Nevertheless, safety is their number one priority.  Out of three (3) years riding every various CTA bus routes, there only has been one (1) accident (not really an accident....but the bus driver ran into something small).  Anyways, they've got my ""reliability"" vote.  Patronizing CTA is definitely not a luxurious experience, and this is certainly not everyone's cup of tea.  Some friends even asked if I ever felt like I would be getting shot.  Well, that wasn't that serious and I didn't want to engage such deep conversations with those friends.  Danger is everywhere, so keep your eyes wide open to be on the lookout.  Many of you will continue seeing me rocking with the CTA.

We took the Metro, via the Blue Line, both to and from O'Hare. While in town, we bussed from Navy Pier to a stop near our hotel. On the way home, I had to take a detour, ending up on a CTA shuttle for a bit. (Of course, when the CTA isn't available, one can always hail a taxi, especially if out late.)Besides being very confused with how to pay for their Metro cards (uh, don't ask), we got ourselves three-day passes, perfect for weekends and worth it for out-of-towners, especially since they can pay for rail AND bus service.

So if say, you find someone's wallet, take it here and let CTA handle it! I'm sure the person that lost it will appreciate your honesty, and will call CTA to retrieve it with all of its contents still intact.I'm sure service at the Sales center depends on whoever's working, similar to the DMV.

This morning August 30, 2020 at a approximately 9:43 a.m. the 53 bus (8132) on Pulaski going south bound passed me right by as I stood with 2 other potential passengers. I am 61 and disabled and one of the other people was on a walker. This is the main reason why I am complaining. We all stood on Van Buren and Pulaski. High crime, high drug invested area. Murders have increased over the last few months in this area. Nonetheless, this driver cruised right by us like it was nothing. I could not believe my eyes. There were literally 7-10 passengers on this bus. I chased the bus to Congress and Pulaski a block away,  and this driver looked me dead in my eyes embarrassingly with a gesture (IM FULL). I was livid to say the least and the people standing on the Pulaski Blue line L station saw it all. With the many corono virus scams this over weight bus driver came to work to drive up and down the street and collect a pay check. Not aware of the many dangers he had left us in. Since the CTA have cameras for crimes. Roll your video back. My time is pretty accurate. To help you even more. The following bus stopped for us all. Bus #53 (4103) @10:03 a.m. This bus was full beyond capacity. Because of the latter bus this driver was pressured and under stress. However, this bus driver was respectful and took his time to accommodate the public. Roll the video back on everything I type. As I said my times, dates, etc. are pretty accurate.  Once again to the consumer. In these times we do not have to riot and loot to express ourselves. You can be right but after committing a crime no one will listen.

Two 24 hour rail lines that cover N/S/E/W orientation, decent bus service, & Ventra app to manage both CTA & Metra cards are pretty solid. It's also pretty reliable no matter what the weather is like. Awesome additions a few years ago with bus timing via ctabustracker.com & station digital signage. Loop Link is great, too.Obviously it's not perfect - when the buses breaks down, someone urinates on the seat, or there is a street person asking for money - but I guess that is part of the experience.

83,4,"May 28, 2014","The Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) is largely an effective system.  I've have only ridden the rails, or ""the El,"" given that the Orange Line is one of the train lines that actually circulates on that elevated ring, or loop, around downtown Chicago which has most of the stops one will need if visiting the Windy City. I don't believe all of their dedicated heavy rail lines travel on this archaic structure, which feels really funky and slow when it's elevated in that ""canyon"" between major buildings in the center of the city.  The Ventra $10 day pass is useful.  It is an easy way to travel in the service zone and cheaper and less cumbersome than buying separate passages.Both O'Hare and Midway airport trains come into the city via traditional subway type cars.  It seems like the system is well thought out, with different nodes at which various lines come together, bus service splices in, and connections to other commuter rail options to the northern suburbs or areas to the south, as far as suburbs in Indiana, are available.  Most of it seems to be above ground but, in the center, the Red Line does function as a subway for at least part of the way and runs parallel to and west of famed Michigan Avenue and its Magnificent Mile.I'm deducting a star because the trains aren't the cleanest, there are some sketchy types on board (damn, that's judgmental), and parts of the infrastructure are old.  There are periodic service interruptions to address this.  I got nabbed in such an interruption.  On the Orange Line from Midway, the track between two important stations, Halsted and Roosevelt, was closed for work.  For a trek that should take about 4 or 5 minutes on the train, the ""bus bridge,"" with its waits on both ends, took about 20 minutes.  Then, if you think the track infrastructure is old, check out the dated stations in the Loop, which look like something put together at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution.  Regardless, they have their charm.When you first board a CTA train, the first thing that hits you over the head is how multiethnic, diverse, and crusty Chicago is.  Yet, despite that, there are NO bilingual announcements.  How would that even be feasible?

84,3,"Jun 27, 2017","This is coming from a tourist from Des Moines that doesn't deal with public transportation, especially on this scale.If visiting is using the CTA an efficient way to get around town? Yes. For the most part I would say yes. We stayed out by the airport so by utilizing the park and ride we were able to travel to both Wrigley Field and downtown, using the L and buses. On the multiple rides we took we never really had issues with delays.Is the CTA clean? Clean is a relative term. Most of the trains themselves seemed clean on the inside. Some of the stations on the other hand were downright dingy and stinky. I'm not a germophobe but there were surfaces on both the train and at the stations that I refused to touch.Is the CTA safe? It's public transportation in the third largest city in the US. Safety can sometimes be a gamble. I would say that if you are riding during the day or during peak times like before/after a Cubs game gets out, you will probably be safe. I'm not sure I would ride it after sundown but that's just Iowa me talking. You will see your fair share of homeless people and beggars at time. For the most part I can deal with that. Luckily in our visits we've never once ran into any type of criminal activity.",cta
85,4,"Jul 8, 2014","It's kind of hard to rate Chicago's transit system right after visiting NYC.  This is probably the 2nd best mass transit in the country.  But I do have some complaints.  First off, their new Ventra concept is awesome.  One of those smart tap credit cards.  Genius! However, it does cost you $5 per card.  But I guess that technology does not come cheap.If you're a visitor for more than a couple of days go with one of the unlimited packages.  You will totally use the value and then some.We had the weekly unlimited pass even though we were there for 4 days.  After the 2nd day we had used up the price and then on the way back to the airport instead of a cab ride we paid for the original cost of the cards.As far as the transit system if you stick to the trains (color lines), it's spectacular, but when you start using their bus system, is when you want to start pulling your hair out.The color lines run pretty consistent and are fast.  The buses on the other hand are hit or miss.  Certain buses by the end of the trip I noticed were more on time.  While other more specialized buses, I guess, would often miss there time window not once or twice and end up arriving after the 3rd schedule pick up.  Other times the bus drivers would just look at you and keep on driving.  By the end of the trip I had decided no more buses and just walk to the nearest line and take that and walk some more because the buses were so unreliable even if it provided a ""shorter route"".",cta

90,5,"Mar 24, 2016","Writing this review as a lowly tourist from Atlanta who's spent most of her adult life riding our podunk-ass MARTA:So I was in Chicago for about 5 days and got a week-long pass because 1) I stayed in a place that was two blocks from a stop and 2) I knew I'd be doing a shit ton of touristy things like going to a ton of museums, galleries, jazz clubs (Green Mill, holla), hipster bars and barcades, etc. So the convenience alone of being able to zip from one place to another was a Godsend. I mean, I could get from my AirBnB and be at Stan's Donuts in Wicker Park in like 20 minutes or so- that's WITH a transfer from a green line to a blue line. There were some delays occassionally, but hell, that's life, so I wasn't too fussed about them. Yeah it was pretty cold and that sucked, but they have heating stations, y'all. HEATING STATIONS. Let me tell something about petty-ass MARTA in Atlanta. One winter's night when I was waiting for a bus at one of the train stations that happens to have a little heating station - two workers there were warming themselves up, I waited til they left so I could get me some of that good warm heat. So they proceeded to turn that shit off as soon as they were done using it. Bastids. Anyways, heating stations throughout the fall-winter are a major plus AND they're always on? WHAT? Let's see, even the busses - when I had to take one - weren't too bad. They were mostly clean, usually timely, some of the little bus shelters have the upcoming times scrolling on a screen. WOW! You can even text a special number with the route that you're waiting for and some magic machine will text you the upcoming times - friggin amazing!What else, the trains, busses, stations were mostly clean, especially within the loop. The people, well you see all kinds of people on public transpo. So I guess if you're like scared by ""sketchy"" looking people - don't go to Chicago...just kidding - take Uber or rent a car.The workers there when I needed help getting somewhere were quite helpful also. Don't be scared to ask most of them know the lines like the back of their hand. The only thing that CAN be kind of confusing is all the different lines, but I'm coming from a place with literally only two goddamn lines so maybe I was overwhelmed. And I'm not going to lie; I did get lost a lot. But, definitely if you're staying in/near the loop, get you a pass for however many days and enjoy the convenience of CTA.",cta

The archaic seating arrangement isn't very conducive to all the bags being brought on from O'Hare.

First I must mention cleanliness. I took the train from O'Hare to Monroe station and did not see any liter on neither train nor station. Thumbs up to both residents and the transit authority for doing such a magnificent job at caring for your environment.      Also navigation was pretty straight forward I was able to look up directions using my iPhone days before my trip. Upon arrival to the airport I was able to  follow the signs to the transit station. I also bought my Ventura pass needing no assistance as the machines were pretty straight forward.    I was swiping in incorrectly and transit workers nearby quickly showed me to place it over the yellow area and I was on my way. Considering I was traveling at peek rush hour I was shocked that there  were no delays. Overall Chicago's transit system is light years ahead of NY as we are now getting the digitally time updates of when the busses will be arriving: anyways I found the CTA system to be efficient and I'm happy I utilized it. This was the cheapest option to get from the airport to my downtown destination.",cta

Compared to Boston, Philadelphia, Washington, Houston, New York... Chicago knows what it's doing!Rail service is frequent and almost rarely delayed due to traffic. Well, maybe there are slight delays here and there, but I wouldn't know because I leave early every day anyway, and I'm pretty sure traffic is built into the scheduling.CTA is pretty responsive on Twitter and it's actually cool to check out the feed. They share interesting stuff. Even better, though, is that people complain sometimes to the CTA and the CTA staff are experts at tactfully shutting down people who make mountains out of molehills.I refuse to permit the denizens of the train system to impact a rating on its reliability, but I must acknowledge the reality. Sometimes the trains really do smell like pee. Sometimes there are people who reek of urine sleeping on the train. Sometimes people who reek of urine ride the overnight trains so they can sleep on the train. That's... reality. And it's also a human services issue, not a public transportation issue. Maybe if there were sufficient social services so people facing homelessness or already are homeless had places to go where they were treated with dignity, the trains wouldn't smell like pee.Then again, I take the red line, and one lesson has been learned: the same bros who complain about the homeless passengers do a great job puking and pissing on the train, too.",cta

97,1,"Jun 8, 2018",The Ventra Card debacle!  The cta has its own problems but now they have a for profit company that we pay a premium to - in increased rates - that adds to the CTA's problems.Ventra sent us a faulty card.  The ventra operator on the phone (since it's a school card) could not issue us a new card.  Instead we have to reapply for a new card ourselves and pay another fee for the new card.  Then we can call in and they will credit the new card with the old defective card remaining balance.What a pain and super stupid and inefficient process.  This is what happens when you sell off government services people - it doesn't get any better only more expensive.  AND you now pay a premium because you've got shareholders who need a return.Ugh!

I was using CTA for a couple of years when I was in Chicago.Few of the facts about CTA--The monthly pass just costs $86 and single ride is $2.25 with a transfer just costing 25 cents and second transfer is free (Transfer should be done within 2 hours of start of journey)--They have a CTA tracker application where one can track the buses. It is really awesome and is accurate 95% of the time.One can also get the update to date information on schedule by sending a text message.--Awesome connectivity to trains connecting suburbs.They have link up pass which just costs $45 and one can use it on CTA and PACE buses to travel to union station to catch the Metra Trains. There is nothing like link up pass in NYC which makes one buy different passes (LIRR, Subway,PATH etc).-- The stations on almost all the CTA lines are super clean and very well maintained unlike the subway stations on MTA in NYC.Though I adore CTA but there have been times when it has annoyed me. The most annoying thing which I observed  was that multiple buses arrive at the same time. That just does not make any sense because the other two buses will go almost empty. Many a times there have been unannounced delays in CTA trains specially in the blue line while going towards Ohare.",cta

103,1,"Jul 13, 2008","This is like shooting fish in a barrel, but I'm going to do it anyway.First, two stories:1.  A few weeks ago, on a Sunday night, I went to the Randolph station to catch a northbound Brown Line.  I just missed a train, so I decided to time the next one.  The station timetable claims an arrival every ""7-10 minutes"" at that day/time, at which I laughed out loud.  I said, ""Ha!  Forget seven, I'll even give you the ten.  I bet twelve to fifteen.""  Not even close.  TWENTY-SEVEN MINUTES!  I could have rowed Washington across the Delaware in less time.2.  Today I was walking up Clark Street, just crossing Lawrence, when I saw THREE southbound #22 buses pulling up to the stop.  Three, right in a row!  Not within a minute, but literally each behind the other.  I know that ""bunching"" is no news to anybody, but I don't take buses (it's a long story, but I'm committed to it) so I had never seen it in action.I've lived here a long time but the recent funding ""crisis"" caused me distill my years of frustration with the CTA, in my own mind.  My main objection to the CTA is the mismanagement.  Poor operation that manifests itself in a million little ways across the system can only be the product of bad leadership, right at the top.  They spent months begging the legislature for money, sending emails to customers and posting notices asking us to write our congresspersons.  Meanwhile, half the stations in the system are undergoing renovation while riders are inconvenienced every day, plus a few years ago they built an entire new train line!  What the hell are they doing throwing money away like this?  Have you heard of responsible budgeting, CTA?  Fiscal planning?  COMMON SENSE?They need to focus their priorities on the basics--keeping the trains, buses, and stations clean and making the routes run on time.  Clean and on-time is all we want!  CLEAN AND ON-TIME!I could rant on, but nobody wants to read that.  CTA--get your act together.",cta

Sharp metal cleats.IN OTHER NEWS:The entire CTA bus fleet is now GPS-enabled and on the Bus Tracker system. For those of us without fancy web browsing iDunnos, there's a handy new text message feature. (This, while New York's MTA has finally abandoned its failed attempt to implement a similar service.)Sure, the buses tend to be erratic and clump, but I'm growing more convinced that that is largely caused by ignorant, inconsiderate riders who won't buck up and follow a few simple rules:- when the bus pulls up, fucking board it; why shuffle over like you've got a turd halfway out your ass?- have your damned money/card ready as you board; most likely there are people behind you and the bus will not leave until everyone is on- while you're waiting for the bus/behind a malingerer, get your damned money/card ready- move to the rear of the bus as instructed by the big red stickers and the recording of the nice man with the nice Midwestern accent; due to layoffs caused by the economic recession, the CTA will no longer offer complimentary ass-wiping at the entrance- exit at the rear; no one can get on when you exit at the ENTRANCE- don't get all haughty when I tell you you're a dumbass for exiting at the entranceIf we estimate that people who pull these dumbass moves delay a bus by 15 - 30 seconds at every stop, think about how much time that adds to every trip.AND ON THE TRAIN:Similar rules apply. It's even easier than crying into your bottle of BooHoo! I'm not lying. Cross my heart and hope to brand your piggies with my cleats. Truth!I feel that things seem to be going quite well right now. The station agents seem more pleasant, the trains seem to run regularly. The people who complain about piss and vomit like it's a daily occurrence must have severely bad karma. Or maybe they're habitual complainers. Hmm, let's ponder that possibility. The last time I saw vomit on the train was in 1996, and I ride the trains and buses a lot, all over the city, at all times. And even then, I was disgusted by the puke, not at the CTA. Duh!IN CLOSING:The CTA is far from perfect but it really does the job if you can button your pants and shut the hell up. In my dreams, the system would work like the ones in Tokyo, Singapore, Paris and a handful of other cities (but still maintain 24-hour service, of course).

108,4,"Jan 17, 2009","I've given this some thought and think there's been a misunderstanding.THE CTA IS A PUBLIC TRANSIT SYSTEM, NOT PERSONAL DAYCARE FOR A BUNCH OF OVER-ENTITLED CRYBABIES.Of course there are going to be delays and breakdowns in service if people don't learn to ride responsibly. Here are some simple tips. Feel free to share:- hustle when the train/bus pulls in, don't amble over like you're getting popcorn during commercial break- when you board the train, KEEP MOVING IN as far as possible; don't stop to take in the view- if you're by the door, step off to let others out; this eliminates the irrational fear of riders getting stuck in the car and missing a stop and, therefore, the unwillingness to move towards the centre of the car in the first place- if you're waiting to board, wait till others have exited; only salmon should work so hard against an oncoming deluge- your groceries, backpack, laptops and miscellaneous bullshit didn't pay a fare so they are not entitled to their own seat- SIT DOWN if there's an empty seat so others can move in; you're not a hero for standing that extra stop or two- resist the urge to chat with the bus driver and MOVE DOWN THE BUS- exit buses at the rear whenever possible so you don't impede rapid boarding at the ENTRANCE; there are stickers and announcements requesting you do this so there's no excuse for you not to do so, unless you're deaf and blind as well as stupid- speak up if you witness dumbassedness; crying into your Pinot Grigio after the fact helps absolutely no one- keep your boring cellphone/live conversations to yourselves, and turn your cheesy music down (well, none of these disrupts service but I just want to point out that you're neither interesting, special nor important)I used to get frustrated at the CTA for their seeming incompetence, but when I really thought hard about it, a large part of the problem fell squarely on the empty heads of many who use the system. You can throw all the money and planning you want into the CTA and they will still fail if people insist on working against them. There's no way the CTA can overcome millions of lazy, ignorant dumbasses coming at them each day. Simply none.Don't even try comparing the CTA to mass transit systems in other cities. Well, if you do, first use them and take note of how much more civic-minded their riders are. Even in New York, whose residents are much maligned for being 'assholes', you will note that people generally approach public transit as a PUBLIC SERVICE, meaning no one gets special treatment unless they actually need it. No one on the MTA will put up with any of the shit that happens on the CTA. If that makes them assholes, it also makes you a dumbass crybaby.No doubt, the system is far from perfect. I think we all know that. But if we truly want the CTA to improve and succeed, we have to do our part. Yes, whining to your friends is easier and probably more fun, but it doesn't get the job done.One more thing: KEEP YOUR DAMNED HOOVES OFF THE SEATS. That's just fucked up.",cta
109,4,"Apr 7, 2012","Disclaimer:  I was only in town for 5 days, in a sub-let in Wicker Park.  That said, I *love* the CTA!  We used the Blue Line to get from O'Hare to Wicker Park, and from Division to the Loop.  We used the Red Line to get to opening day at Wrigley, and took the Brown Line back to the Loop.  We took various buses to the Museum of Science and Industry and to the Field Museum.  We traveled early to mid-morning, and typically came home during rush hour.  With all that, the longest we ever waited for a ride was 8 minutes after having just missed the #6 bus from Science & Industry.  The rush hour crowds were no worse than anywhere else, and significantly better than in my native NYC.The only down side, IMHO, was insufficient explanation regarding the difference between CTA and Pace services - at O'Hare, anyway... so we wound up paying for services (Pace) we didn't need.  I think some simple signage by the vending machine would set that right.  Oh, and without Pace, it's only $23 for unlimited rides over 7 days ($28 with Pace).  Kudos to the CTA!",cta

If you don't want to mess around with the refunded $5 card fee when you purchase at a machine, you can go to the ventra website prior to your trip and they will mail your card to you without the $5 charge. I would go to the Ventra website anyway if you're unfamiliar with the system. There is plenty of helpful information and videos which will probably answer any questions you may have.We didn't spend a dime on a rental car, cab, or UBER. We never worried about things like taking a wrong turn or getting lost. We didn't have to drive around in circles to find parking nor did we have to follow anyone to their parking spot. We were never late. And we didn't pay one parking fee, especially the bend-you-over hotel overnight parking fee.From our Magnificent Mile hotel location to any of our destinations, we never had to make more than one transfer and we never had to walk more than two or three blocks. Google Maps was an invaluable tool that I used to get from point A to B that never let us down. We were able to find exact departure and arrival times, stop locations, and bus/train numbers using the app.Yes, it is public transportation so there are some unsanitary areas. You're sure to find some homeless and just general Shady McGradys hanging out.

The CTA is probably the cheapest way to get around town in Chicago, especially if you're a tourist which reminds me I need to go download some maps so I can plan my next trip out accordingly. It's definitely not as good as other public transports I've experienced but it's efficient along the lakefront areas and sufficient for where I want to go. At $23 or $28 for a full 7-day unlimited use, this is probably the best way to go which saves a great amount of bus fare for one trip.

I know people know people are frequently dogging the CTA, but seriously people, like John B, most of my complaints are with the riders. Use some common courtesy once in a while! Here are some tips: * Say excuse me, don't just push by people* If the bus is filling up, put your crap on your lap* Don't clog the front of the bus or stand under the back sensor so the door inevitably jams and the driver has to come fix it* If the bus or L is crowded and there's an empty seat you're standing in front of take it; I don't care if you get off at the next stop, it creates room. Or move so someone else can.* Get up for the pregnant, elderly and handicapped* Tourists and infrequent riders do a little up front research, we all hate when you stand in the doorway playing 20 questions with the driver while we all wait.My 2 favorite things about the CTA? Chicago Card and Bus Tracker. Seriously, like other Yelpers have said the #11 has become my new BFF since getting added to bus tracker, and thanks for doing it just before winter too!  Now please go and get the other routes I ride on bus tracker - double time!Bottom line: Despite some of its faults and sometimes smelly buses or trains the CTA is great. TIP: If you lose/break your Chicago Card, or if it blows out of your hand and gets run over by a train, you can order one online for pick-up or delivery OR you can go to the CTA office in the West Loop and get a new one on the spot.TIP: This trip planner works way better than the Google one http://tripsweb.rtachicago.com/",cta
122,3,"Nov 1, 2013","There are positives here. The train services both the major airports of Chicago, and runs reasonably fast to the heart of the city and services a wide variety of other areas. It's ridiculously cheap. It's one fare to go anywhere in the system, unless you get on at the airport which costs twice as much (but still not a whole lot). The one employee I interacted with at length had no clue about places to eat near the station where she worked (odd), but was at least friendly enough to help with a few things.The downsides are that the trains are dirty, crowded, and look like they're from the '60s. It's a confusing system and it seemed I wasn't the only one who needed help understanding the ticketing, the gates, and the stops. Their machines don't give change. Many stops are not handicap accessible (and also a challenge for anyone with luggage). It seems like a broken down old system in need of major overhaul.As compared to public transit in my hometown (DC), there were two key advantages. One: nothing broke down while I was there. Two, at least they're not gouging on fares.",cta
123,3,"Sep 17, 2008","For all of the talk about how much financial trouble the CTA is in, I expected their Customer Service Center on Lake Street to be in some dank basement .  And based on the level of service I'd heard about, I had the mental picture of it being in a dungeon with apparatus for torturing those poor souls who need customer service from one of Chicago's least popular abbreviation agencies.If function followed form, the customer service center should be a beautiful experience.  The second story of CTA Headquarters in the west loop is an airy, open space, and well climate controlled.  The glass and steel design makes it seem like it would be space aged and fast.  Kind of an anti-Secretary of State's office.In general customer service there was this potential pleasant experience.  The Customer Service desk knew exactly what to do to replace an expired Chicago Plus card I had for which the replacement had got lost in the mail.  The purchasing clerk who I saw first, on the other hand, seemed have no idea where my card was or what my desire was (that I wanted to pick up a new card and have the one lost in the mail cancelled).What was odd about splitting my transaction was that the customer service clerk seemed to have more information about my transit card than the purchasing clerk.  The guy working Customer Service gave me a number on a post-it-note and told me exactly what to say to Purchasing.  When I said these words, a glimmer of recognition crossed the face of purchasing and the transaction was done in two minutes.  Why CTA has customer service and purchasing done by two separate people I'm not sure (I though they administered a lot of redundant administration).  I'm glad they weren't together, however, or my experience with purchasing would have rated a pure one star (when I came back on Monday to find no replacement card).  Customer service seemed like more of an ombudsman than anything.  Just a recommendation: unless you know exactly what to ask, see customer service first and not second.All that being said, for cut-and-dry situations, purchasing has four windows running at lunch and the lines went incredibly quickly.If everyone was cross-trained in the service area at CTA headquarters, the overall experience would match the sleek design of the offices.",cta

Anyone who has ridden mass transit in another country will be disappointed.  That's why I was disappointed on arriving in Chicago and witnessing the dilapidated state CTA is in.  That was in 1996.  And I was comparing it to Japan and Korea, where you don't need a car in any major city because you can take mass transit anywhere.  And it's always clean and always on time.  You can practically set your watch even by bus service in those countries.  It's hard to put into words how malnourished mass transit is here, especially after the recent alleged ongoing ""improvements"".  CTA is suffering from decades of neglect.

We were easily and quickly able to find the train at the airport.  The ticket kiosks were also very simple to use.  I bought a 3-day unlimited pass for $20.  The train ride into town was about 40 minutes.  It's a little tough with luggage, but very doable.  The train obviously got more congested as we made our way downtown.  Train cars were decent.

However, as someone whom has traveled to more than 20 countries, the CTA (along with the majority of public railing in the country) is absolutely atrocious. As anecdotes, while visiting Australia, Europe, and much of Asia-I was thoroughly impressed with how their subways and elevated rail cars operated like clockwork...arriving on schedule to the exact minute. While the Metra is comparable to other developed nations, every single day I wonder, ""why, in the hell won't the CTA (and America) consult with other nations in order to learn the correct methods for operating public transportation?""

Many a cold January morning did I stand on the sidewalk waiting for my bus, only to see FOUR 22s or 36s all bunched together in a convoy, each bus unable to escape from the pack.  Which bus will stop for you and which will blow past you?  Which bus is jammed with people and which is nearly empty?  Which bus will win in the weekly North-South Leapfrog Contest and get you downtown the fastest?This isn't nearly the extent of the problems with the buses, and I won't even address the trains here.  But for all the CTA's quirks, its rude passengers and gruff drivers, and its downright maddening qualities, it is a comparatively well-run, efficient, cheap, reliable, and convenient method of transportation.Occasionally, one experiences per se awful or excellent service and Yelps about it, but by and large, reviews are written and stars are given to an establishment based on its relative performance to like establishments.  I compare the CTA to the St. Louis and DC Metros.  Based on the operation of those two outfits, without reviewing them here, I can confidently give the CTA four stars.",cta
138,2,"Apr 25, 2018","I love Chicago and was looking forward to playing tour guide to some friends from FL who decided to spend the week there. I wanted all to go smoothly and researched which train stops had elevators in order to avoid 2 60+ year olds and a millenial female from having to carry heavy luggage up or down stairs. The trip began to sour almost immediately because the elevator at the Roosevelt station was out of order. OK, things happen. We needed to switch to the red line and had to go outside in the cold around a building to another elevator dragging all the bags with us. That was when I became embarrassed for the City and for myself because I am always bragging about Chicago. The elevator smelled like a sewer and the liquid on the floor of it was something you do not want to step in or stand your suitcases in. Fortunately, someone was kind enough to open the gate to the train for us so that we did not have to pay again and we boarded the red line. Going to O'Hare for 7AM return flight yesterday, the elevator at Clark and Lake was just being locked. The man said it was ""not acting right.""  I had no time to waste and so I asked him to let me take one more ride (willing to take my chances), but when the elevator went down, the door would only open 7 inches and could not be forced open (would have been nice if he had told me that was the problem), so I wasted time going back up and finding the escalator. Thank goodness that was working because sometimes it is not. SO DEAREST CHICAGO:  Elevators in train stations are CRUCIAL. It is already a shame that they are not in every station, but $$$$ MUST be spent to make sure they NEVER break down. Elevator function needs to be checked and fixed on every one during the night so they are not malfunctioning at rush hour. This is not just for seniors with luggage, but parents with strollers and people in wheelchairs needing to get to work. These elevators look like they have done their time, they move at a snail's pace and need to be replaced. And providing a public restroom with BIG signs to them in the station may deter people from urinating in the elevators. That is a health hazard and an embarrassment to the City of Chicago.",cta

However, with parking, insurance, and towing in the winter, I knew I had to become friends with CTA this summer. And I did. I have been too/ lived in a few major cities and Chicago was made for CTA. I mean, I really only have to pay $90 a month to get around anywhere and anytime. I love that I can text to know when the next bus is coming. I love the heaters on the train's stops in the winter. I like that CTA expanded its Zip Car efforts. I like the Chicago Plus card. I also like how CTA has made sure it's connected to the Metro and South Shore line. My family and I appreciate this. You can learn the city by learning your way around the Red Line. Ok, so improvements for CTA would be having cleaner cars for the trains, have police/security ride the trains for peddle handlers (esp. now during the holidays), and heat at every train stop (what about Brown-Kedzie!) I think adding more bus shelters with the marquee would be helpful they have in Hyde Park. Other than that, it IS public transportation. Keep that in mind, we better be grateful Chicago has invested in a public trans system as large and outreached as CTA is, as other large cities are still trying to figure out how to get to our level. I've seen and experienced much worst. No worries about gas, insurance, parking, towing...the list goes on; I like it! CTA is a life saver and I will sure miss it when I leave Chi-town.

145,1,"Oct 8, 2014","It's been a long time coming, but I finally remembered to review the gruesome, inefficient, Chicago Transit Authority Corporation. The services provided by the CTA truly epitomize the essence of incompetence. From the rampant crime in almost every station, to the recurring smell of urine in almost every station, there isn't anything remotely enjoyable about riding the CTA except for the occasional El ride with an empty car and a nice view. Unfortunately, most of us city dwellers are forced to ride it, because who wants to pay for parking or a cab every single day?! I sure as hell do not. Ventra has been a nightmare; I am routinely charged extra by the machines, and despite writing complaints, I am never refunded. Further, the trains are consistently overcrowded with uneven run times, making the commutes last longer. Efficiency is not the CTA's strong suit. Also, who remembers the moron who fell asleep at the wheel and crashed a train into the O'Hare escalator!?There is really nothing good to say about the CTA. It's a shame so many of us are so reliant on it. It's like the airlines or cable companies - we hate them, but we are forced to use them! Damn monopolies...

The Red Line is definitely a lot grittier than the other lines. Unlike New York, the line wasn't completely congested with panhandlers, but you definitely had to be aware of your surroundings. It did get very crowded at times, but it was easy to navigate. Plus you can't beat the view from the Brown Line. I'd ride it again just for that view. So take it for what it is.

It's like an aging relative -- sometimes it has good days, sometimes it has bad days. Are the good days good enough to make up for the bad days? For me, yes.It's unfortunate that the CTA is a victim of our corrupt political system. No one in power is really vested in fixing the CTA. Its perpetual budget crisis is due in part to mismanagement from within, but primarily from the fact that politicians have more to gain from a transit system that is at least partially broken -- and which they can use to feed voters on both sides -- than one that works smoothly. Oh jeez, here I am on that soapbox again.There are things to hate about the CTA. The 22 Clark bus is a mystery. It runs on whatever schedule it likes, and has done so for at least 15 years. The construction crews, which always seem to consist of at least twice as many men necessary to do the job, are a constant annoyance. But the CTA allows me to live in Chicago without a car, and is one of the things that has kept me here so long.You know what I hate most about the CTA? People.

I was leaving my apartment at the same time, but the express bus that I normally caught to work simply stopped coming. I tracked it on the bus tracker, and sure enough - it just disappeared. The next express bus came 10 minutes later, but then I would end up being a few minutes late to work... and I HATE HATE HATE being late, even if no one else cares.One morning I decided to email the CTA and ask them why they got rid of this bus run, thus putting about 30 minutes between two express buses in the morning.Here's the key - I didn't email them and act super bitchy like I'm sure a million people do. I simply asked a question, gave them the information from the bus schedule on their site so they would know exactly which bus I was talking about, and I even took a screen shot of the bus tracker so they could see that there was a bus missing.The NEXT MORNING... as in, less than 24 hours after I sent my email, they had a supervisor at my usual bus stop. He asked a few of us waiting if we were waiting for that specific bus, and we all said yes. We all told him it hasn't been coming for a few weeks, and at first he was sarcastic with us... until he saw we were right. Oooh, burn, CTA man!A few hours later the CTA emailed me, letting me know that I was correct (don't you love hearing that?), there was a problem with that run and the supervisors were on it.It took a couple days, but now that run is back to it's regular schedule, and so am I. It comes like clockwork every day when it's supposed to, and this makes me happy.So folks, if you have a problem with the CTA, here's my advice - as frustrating as it can be, know that no system is perfect. Don't give them attitude, just contact them with as much factual information as you can. It seems like they actually do care and when they are given proper info, they will do their best to fix it.Now, let's just hope this review doesn't jinx my bus...",cta

I swear that the bus drivers actually try to knock  you over by pushing down on the gas as soon as you swipe your oh so classy ventra payment card, way before you have a chance to even look for a handrail, it must be some kind of game. The schedule is totally theoretical, not something you can rely upon, it's kind of like being in Colorado and using a map of Kentucky to find your way around. For people who are poor and/or are trying to be environmentally conscious, you sure feel like you are being punished if you subscribe to the hellish conditions of the cta. Every morning I get on the train, it smells as if it has been raining urine, I believe there is a hidden sprinkler system that sprays piss all over the seats and floors right after the ""end of the line"" announcement is given. To transfer at the Washington train platform, you have to pay, the others are free, why? Because the urine sprinkler system is disabled and you have a chance to browse the dozens of merchandise carts that sell iPhone cases. When I travel on the cta, I truly hate myself and every decision I have ever made, you will too, join the city of Chicago in hating yourself, where you come from and where you are going.

163,4,"Apr 30, 2009","Though I can for sure say that this isn't the absolute greatest transit in the world (Europe's got way more on us), I'm a huge, huge fan of the Chicago Transit Authority.  I have been prompted to update my review after visiting their newly updated website (www.transitchicago.com) and being pleasantly surprised.  I really love the format!  It's very user friendly and very informative.  I was on the website to try and find more information about bike racks at my local blue line station and everything I needed to know was there!!  There were maps of stations, routes and specific information about the kind of bike racks located at my blue line station.  That's exactly what I wanted to know!The blue line is still great (albeit under construction to do some much needed repair/replacement of tracks) and runs quickly during the rush periods.  I love the buses in this city, too.  We really have one of the best and most extensive bus systems in this country.  Have you ever been to New York?  They have like three buses and it's super annoying (sure, they have way more trains, but still).  Detroit has that one bus that sucks and who knows what is happening in L.A., but it ain't pretty.  We really take our transit system for granted and I don't really know why.  No other cities have the same kind of bus system as Chicago so suck it up and quit your complaining.  And just as a note, I'm as angry as you about fare hikes.  It seems like they continually raise fares and don't really do anything.  A lot of the money needs to go to the Brown Line overhaul because it costs way more than they ever estimated.  I wish this wasn't the case, but I'll deal.  I love our trains and buses because they get me from point A to point B quickly.  Have you ever used the bus tracker?  It's awesome!",cta
164,4,"Sep 12, 2008","CTA is convenient and necessary.  Aside from the occasional problems with late-ness, there's really nothing wrong with CTA.  Our trains go to a lot of convenient places and the buses even more so.  Chicago's bus system is much more extensive than the two other major cities in the U.S., so there really is a bus that goes everywhere.  The facilities are usually clean and the staff are OK to deal with.  Usually the staff in the train stations are jerks who are stunned to find out riders actually have questions or need help with something.  I've found that I just say hi to them if they're around and go on my way - that turns the experience into a pleasant one.  The bus drivers are usually much nicer, especially if you're nice to them.  They also remember you if you take the same bus everyday - it's really nice.  All in all, I've experienced the same crap as everyone else (bus doesn't come for 35 minutes, train is late because of construction, etc.) but I'd rather have the transit system that we do now than a less efficient, less-extensive one.",cta

Usually the train has stopped because either: Someone got mugged or yet another passenger has passed out- during this time the driver will have stopped the train, with the doors open to freezing weather, litter aflutter, every half-sober passenger clutching cheap cell phones cranked up and blaring heavy static trying to emulate music, aggressive panhandlers... And it smells like a port-a-potty.Also, once a passenger dropped their groceries and the car, including me, were covered in flour. I swore. A lot. (For the record, I look little, but I was raised in a big Italian family that works primarily in law enforcement and the military. I can curse colorfully enough to make most cable TV squeamish).

171,4,"Sep 2, 2011","I want to give CTA five stars, but I cannot. Some of the bus lines just don't do well enough.That having been said, CTA, for the most part, rocks my world. The reason is that I just returned to my lovely hometown after living in a mass transit desert, known as the L.A. area, for what seemed like forever. So compared to that, CTA is truly outstanding. I'll take it over sitting in that horrendous, life-paralyzing traffic in L.A. ANY DAY. Even in a blizzard. Yes, even when it is pouring down rain. You know why? Because I have options! I can get to many places in the city by train, bus or a combo. AND, if I opt for an unlimited monthly pass, it amounts to under 1K a year, unlike running a car, which is 8-10K or more. For that alone, CTA is the bomb diggity. Just try doing that in L.A. NOT! Even the poorest of poor people (and there are plenty) in L.A. are riding around in gross polluting cars, getting into accidents and putting other's lives in danger, because many do not even have a driver's license, let alone insurance. No thank you. Oh, and, in case you're wondering, that is in EVERY part of the city. People of low means are driving EVERYWHERE in L.A., because you pretty much have to, if you plan on leaving where you live for any reason, like, say -- work or anything else. Yes, there are some CTA routes that are worse than others. Yes, there are delays. But I've learned to pad my time so that I get to places early or at least on time. It doesn't always work, but, hey .... most of the time I do just fine!Yes, there are some crackpots who ride mass transit. I find these folks entertaining, as long as I am not in physical danger. Here's a tip: sit in the first car, so you're near the driver, if you're squeamish. It's no guarantee, but it's a good idea, especially if it's late. Oh, and be smart about riding late at night. Better to catch a cab than worry, in some of those cases. I believe that if you can live close in along an L train, you're golden. The bus/train combo, unless it is an express, kinda sucks. When I lived 2 blocks from the Red Line I thought I'd died and gone to mass transit heaven. It was just that sublime. I could be at anywhere I needed to be in under around 1/2 hour, since I lived downtown. SCORE! I never even had to check a schedule, because even on weekends, evenings and holidays, they came every few minutes - and I do mean few. Oh, is that a train I hear coming? So what! There'll be another one in around 6 minutes - so no need to run. It just doesn't get any better than that, as far as I am concerned.",cta
172,1,"Sep 2, 2011","I decided to write a review on CTA bus line #155 since I rely upon it heavily to get from the Loyola Red Line stop to and from home.First, this line is almost never on time. No matter what bus tracker says, either the bus is running late, with another one right behind it, or it shows up whenever. I don't expect that a bus is on time always, but this line is bordering on the ridiculous. So much so that I sent in a complaint to the CTA tonight. When this bus does finally show up - the bus stop is so full of people that you then get to ride a packed bus, while another one just sails by you, empty. In fact, I really dislike taking this bus so much that I am going to have to figure out another route for myself - along with moving closer into the city. The area this bus line serves is just too darn far. There's nothing around here - so any time I'm going to do anything, I'm looking at a minimum of 45 minutes to an hour to get to a part of the city that actually has something decent to do. Tonight, I started coming back from downtown at 8pm and did not arrive home until almost 10pm. Arrrrgggggh. This is because the thing was so late (again, with another one right behind it) - it took me nearly 2 hours to get home from downtown. That's just unacceptable.This is why I was looking for a place on the Red Line that was 4 blocks away from it or less. The apt service I used lied to me, and they rushed me through signing a lease without verifying that my needs were met. While this is my fault too, I still feel like I was blatantly lied to. I'd made it clear what I wanted, and they just didn't deliver. Live and learn.So, a word of warning: when you are shown apartments, don't sign anything until you verify that it really meets your needs in terms of transit. I wouldn't live anywhere that you have to rely upon this bus. Can you imagine waiting outside in the freezing cold 30 minutes or more? Not okay.",cta

I've had a few near-mishaps on the Blue Line and survived a fire on the Red Line, but what occured last week makes me disgusted.My brother takes the Blue Line (Forest Park branch) to UIC where's he's a part-time Sophomore.Last Wed. afternoon he was riding in his train car, alone, around 1 pm reading his books. Two men entered his car from another through the emergency doors. This was while the train was in motion between the Oak Park and Harlem stops.

The second came up, strangled him till he went unconsious and took only his wallet, which had no plastic and only $40 in cash.The Oak Park police found him unconsious at the Forest Park station, and he came to and had stitches done at Rush Hospital Oak Park.CTA isn't returning calls or responding to our emails. It was only an aggravated assualt and battery. Honestly, I know its a big city. There's always crime, and desperate times produce desperate acts.

Some of the stations were under construction/skanky, but it didn't seem like any beams were about to fall on my head.The buses were great for getting to those places that the trains were just not close enough to.  I was really impressed with how frequently the buses ran.  I HATE waiting for buses, but every time i tried to walk anywhere here, a bus came trudging along.

However, what good is a network of tracks when a large percentage of them are in disrepair (we're talking cracks in the metal everywhere, people, not just chipping paint) causing the trains to have to go 10mph for fear of DERAILING?  Chicago deserves MUCH better.  A great city, a world-class city as our lovely mayor points out repeatedly, should have a world-class transport system, right?  Hell, I'd settle for an ADEQUATE system.  Quick story: As a public transportation enthusiast, when I moved to Chicago 8 months ago, I was STOKED to ride the CTA to work... relaxing, efficient, eco-friendly, etc.  After the big SNAFU with the derailment downtown in early July (?) 2006 and the myriad ""slow zones"" that were added as a result, it started to take me about 10 extra minutes to get to work (previously a 15 min ride, now 25 mins).  When I realized it now takes me less than 1/2 the time to drive to work, even during rush hour, I started to commute by car.  The goal of public transportation should be to remove cars from the road, NOT to force otherwise happy customers to add them to the already bad traffic.  CTA gets two stars, only because the trains DO get people from point A to point B.  It fails to get any more stars because of the gross mismanagement of the otherwise very nice transport network imposed by the excuse-harboring, managerially incompetent, Daley-machine-appointed Frank Kreusi and the ragtag group of other inept appointees running the system into the ground.PS: from a visitor's perspective, I can see how there's much to like.

Coming from a city where you pretty much need to drive everywhere, the CTA was a huge boon during our car-less stay in Chicago.  I was able to go wherever I needed with relative ease and minor expense.  Travelling around the city like I did was really nice.  It also was a glaring reminder of the transit problems my own city has - trying to get around Atlanta like I did in Chicago would be impossible.  Pros- The train & bus system is large enough that you can actually get to where you want to go (please take note, Atlanta).  It seems like almost everyone uses mass transit which is pretty cool.    - It was pretty easy getting wherever I needed to go using a combination of subway and bus.  Cons- Efficiency was lacking a bit: trains just randomly stopping, delays, lights going out on the train, etc.  Atlanta trains are actually better in this regard which is pretty shocking (though ATL trains are much more limited in their usefulness).  - I wish there were more places to buy passes in the actual terminals.  Leaving the terminal to go to a grocery store to buy a transit pass seemed kind of stupid.  - Crazy people (jittery, mumbling dude yelling ""Wake me up when we play the fuckin' Yankees!"" repeatedly to no one).

195,2,"Jan 25, 2011","I take the train or the bus every day and some days are better than others. But the CTA needs to either give up or catch up with the other public transit systems in the world. I've been fortunate enough to travel and experience quite a few different systems and ours is like the ugly, stupid stepchild compared to others I've seen. The first thing that needs to change... Post train arrival times at ALL stations. Installing big flat screen tvs at some stops only to show advertisements and sports news was a giant tease and most people would agree, a huge waste of resources. Now post arrival times as well and I won't start off every morning in a foul ass mood.",cta
196,4,"Jul 5, 2007","Normally, I love the CTA. I will get on the el and just ride around people watching when I'm basically broke and I need to get out of the house. I ride the blue line down 290 pointing at laughing at people stuck in traffic jams. I've had people shoot me the bird, and in response I usually smile and wave like the driver and I are old chums. Oh, the fun, it just don't stop.But this crap they pulled Tuesday night after the fireworks, with the els being broken, that was ridiculous. First, nobody would tell us what the problem was. Second, the workers (at least at the Quincy stop) who knew perfectly well that the trains were broken were still letting people put their cards into the turnstiles so the CTA could get their $2.Third, I don't think it was an accident. Didn't they threaten to shut down every el line except the blue and red if they didn't get funding from the state? And weren't the blue and red lines the only ones running on one of the busiest public transportation nights of the year?I don't think that's a coincidence. I think it's crap, flat out.But generally, yeah, it's a great system. $4 round trip is a hell of deal when compared to $16-$30 for parking, plus gas used sitting in traffic. The CTA has serious problems about four or five times a year, where as traffic is bad pretty much every freaking day.So get on the el, give public transportation a whirl. Ride it more often than you do now, if you can. Save money, mix among the common folk, spend some time reading the paper or staring blankly out the window.    Do something for which you can respect yourself in the morning, for crying out loud.",cta

The echo and reverb.  The clank of wheels on pavements and tracks.  The disarray of not quite clean behemoths of metal drifting through a sea of gridlock... or wavering above it on the L.I went back to a place where I ran from over 10 years ago last weekend.  I went to discover some answers.  So much of what I found on that trip was myself, even though I was visiting someone.A love affair started in that busy quiet of babbling bums, parkas, cold hands, and moonlit dances as a pair of commuters (one nerdy gimpy punk and one colorful eskimo clad Californian) guided with ease to bus after bus to train.There was beauty in that quiet.  Of finally having the time to just sit down and relax.  To cuddle close and be together.  To read.  To write. To observe the city and people watch.  To enjoy the silence and become enveloped in the sounds around you.He has so much love for his city.  As stop after stop would go by, he would tell me tales of the fabled city, both forgotten and adored.  ""They changed this when you get to these stops.  On Grand and Chicago, it used to say ""This is Grand."" ""This is Chicago.""I listened attentively.  I devoured every morsel of history and knowledge this man had to offer about this city that I had never had the privilege of calling home once upon a decade ago.And the sun shined down on both of them.  And they smiled.The love affair was the city.  The love was with the transit.  And then I went back to Los Angeles and saw more and more that something was missing.  And while he's a swell cat that I adore, I'm not just referring to him.  It was the ability to effortlessly get anywhere within the city that I wanted to go without ever having to deal with a car or even a motorcycle.  Los Angeles is decades away from this.And I thought about my dad and how much he would complain about the commute through the city.  Through this city and out in LA too.  But now I truly believe that he might have just been saying those things to protect me.  There's a reason why there's that plastic divider between the drivers.  And the smell of urine isn't exactly something a father would probably want his daughter dealing with on her daily commute through the paper skyscrapers.

The panhandlers are more aggressive (one has been written up in the Tribune for his numerous arrests related to this) and there is a pretty high rate of snatch-and-run crimes.  In fact I rode it again yesterday and a hapless young lady lost her phone just this way; the CTA employees yelled at her not to run after but she didn't listen, this stopped the train for a bit.    There is a little of this on the El everywhere but it just seems more concentrated here.

And as far as transit systems go it's always worked quite well for my needs. I prefer the Red Line as that takes me to Wrigleyville and places where I have fun, the Orange Line and Blue Line are what always take me home or send me on my way elsewhere. I've only had one issue with a ticket machine in all the years I've used the CTA. I love being able to order Transit Cards online, and the bottom line is when I board a CTA train for the most part I know it's going to get me where I need to be. One thing I will say...standing on a Red Line platorm at 4 am in the winter during a snowstorm was one of the coldest experiences I've ever had. Burrrrr! But the train still was on time. 4 Stars.",cta
203,4,"Mar 29, 2012","This review is for rail service, Blue, Red, and Orange Lines. The CTA is my preferred way to get from Midway / O'Hare to the loop. Access from Midway to the Orange Line is a breeze, and once you find the station at O'Hare the ride to downtown is fast. When you look out the windows at the traffic parked on the Kennedy you'll be thinking your ticket is a sweet deal. The Red Line takes me to Cubs games and to many of the places I like to go in Chicago...and it's my favorite line to ride. For someone from out of town riding the CTA late at night can be...well...interesting. It's also great for people watching....ever seen flight attendants put on makeup as a train car is rocking back and forth at 50 mph at 4 am? I have, and they always look good when they get off onto the platform. In 15+ years of going to Chicago and riding the L I have always felt safe on the trains. When you get off the train and leave the platforms that can be little interesting depending on where you are but I've never had any issues on the trains especially coming or going to the airports.Tip: Passes / Unlimited Ride Cards are the ONLY way to go if you're going to make more than 1 ride on the CTA. $5.75 for one day, $14 for 3 Days. Tip: For Android Phones download the Chicago Transit Tracker App. I've tried the other apps CTA recommends but this is the one I keep coming back to.",cta

Go to DC, or the Metro in Paris, or SanFran, or Milan or anywhere else with an even comparable service....those are better but are also more expensive. That said, we have pretty damn good public transportation for what we pay. Shit, I personally love that i can go weeks without touching my car and not miss it.

My husband and I used the Blue Line to get out to the Allstate Arena to meet our friends for a Chicago Wolves game.  Our friends advised us to allow extra time, telling us to add about 30 minutes to the time we estimated to get out there.  That, and the ""L"" doesn't serve the Arena directly.  One has to get off at Rosemont to change to a bus.If you are staying Downtown (or near Downtown) however, you can't beat the CTA for getting around.  We stayed at the Ambassador East,  and while it was a bit of a walk to the Red Line, the buses on nearby Local Lake Shore Drive went directly to Michigan Avenue, the Loop, and the Museums.

All the lines are colored differently and so it makes it so easy to navigate and ask around for directions.  It actually reminded me of the monopoly board... it literally had all the colors, brown, pink, red, blue, green, ect. There's also something I love about taking public transit... Just the feeling of hopping onto a bus/subway, through all the hustle & bustle of life... and you literally see all different kinds of people walk on and out.

When underground, the hiss is deafening... moreso than any other public transportation system I've ridden on.There is ALWAYS a delay on the trains.  ALWAYS.  Seriously... no matter how often they work on the track, it always seems to be mucked up.  ALWAYS.  How is that possible?  For all the time they spend working on it you'd think it would actually, you know, be working once in a while.  But no.  And it's just gonna get worse whatwith the improvements (which are needed, so... meh).Do you need to use an elevator?  Tough.  Most stations don't have one... and those that do, well... you have a 50/50 chance of the elevator's actually working.  Sorry.  Of course, that's one of the ""improvements"" they're making... so kudos.  We'll see how that goes, now won't we?The buses are ALWAYS late.  ALWAYS.  I've waited for buses for half and hour without seeing one going in EITHER direction and finally decided to walk.  About 20 minutes into my walk I saw 4 (!!!) in a row pass in the other direction (never did see one going in my direction during the 45 minute walk).  And events like this aren't rare... not at all.The trains and buses are VERY dirty.  For the $2 each way they charge (more expensive than most other cities, even cities with higher property/upkeep costs, and about the same as New York, which has MUCH higher property/upkeep costs), you get to sit in trash.  And if you're from Boston or San Francisco and used to bringing your dog on the train/bus with you... forget about it.  That's the one rule they DO enforce (I E-mailed them about it - their excuse was that they were weary of the clean-up costs... wtf???  It's not like they clean anyway).All public transportation systems have problems... but Chicago's is REALLY bad.  Hopefully it will get better... I'm giving 2 stars just because apparently they're (finally) trying to address the problems and make improvements (though it's just gonna be eve worse for a few years while they do so).  Oh... and the trains run late (often until 2am or so), which is rad, and major props for that.  *note: I realise no public transportation system is clean... but gripe is that they overcharge for the luxury of not cleaning, then turn around and use the argument of ""extra cleaning"" as a scapegoat for not allowing dogs.",cta

In the past I'd seen stampedes, trains breaking down and causing massive delays in subways and long lines of angry people waiting for buses that never show up on time. 4th of July weekend was hectic and crowded but it looks like enough people had enough sense to think ahead of time and buy their transit cards ahead of time so there was hardly any clogs in the system that weekend. I appreciate the facelifts some of the stations have gone under, the lack of urine on the subway stairs-especially the Chicago and State red line stop and electronic updates.A great thing about the CTA is that it's still only $2.25 to hop on a train and get from one length of the city to the other. When you tell someone from the bay area it's $2.25 to get from Howard to downtown, it's a massive relief to not pay upwards of $20 for one train ride.

I envy Chicago because of the good, strong public transportation available to residents, suburbanites, and visitors alike.  Chicago, because it is a big city with much of the troubles and seedy element of any city, has some interesting people who ride it.  People who smell.  Are drunk.  Sometimes even those who will drink while riding on the 'L'.  But guess what, it's PUBLIC transportation!  And there are many well-behaved, bathed, civil and well-dressed (and good-looking) people who ride the trains and buses throughout the city.Transit in Chicago has always been rough, and the CTA, according to history, as seen MUCH WORSE days.  But they have upgraded stations, vehicles, rail cars, and track to keep a good level of service, and keep and attract residents and business, and oh so many visitors, giving them affordable (and fun) ways to move throughout the city, whether they flew into Midway of O'Hare, took Amtrak, or drove into town.""L"" Service is frequent throughout the day, and on weekends as well.  Evening service is not bad.  Red and Blue lines? 24 hour sevice!  Bus routes are also plentiful, some of them running late/overnight (I think) and fairly frequent.

Last week, I was stuck on the train at Grand because there was a one track operation at Clark and Lake, because of said construction.  we were at Grand for almost 30 minutes while we had to wait for O'hare bound trains to clear.  That's all well and good, and I, of all people, understand about delays, ect.  But after 30 minutes of sitting there, I REALLY had to ""powder my nose!""  I walked off of the train and headed to the first car where the train operator was, and asked him how much longer we would be sitting here.  He smiled and politely told me the situation, and that we would be waiting for at least 2 more O'hare trains to pass before we would be able to move.  I asked him if there was any way that I could use the restroom upstairs.  He then tried to find the supervisor to see if I could, but he had just disappeared down the tracks. He told me that I had plenty of time to go and come back and the train would be still sitting at the station.  He then told me to go up and tell the security guy that the conductor said I could use the bathroom at the station.  I thanked him and ran up top.The security guy wouldn't let me use the station bathroom, but he told me what restaurant I could go to and use theirs, and he promised to let me back in when I came back.  Skeptical, but desperate, I followed his advice and off I went.  When I came back, he DID remember me, and let me back down, and the train was STILL sitting there.  I hopped back on the train in my same seat, and not 2 minutes later we FINALLY on our way.Now I am sure the operator was getting bombarded with angry people wanting to know how much longer, long before I asked him myself.  The fact that he calmly, and politely answered my questions and request impressed me.  The fact that the security guy could have been a complete jerk and not let me back down to the train again, but didn't impressed me too.

I have no problem with raising fares if the increase is used to improve the infrastructure and overall service is improved, not the CEOs wallets getting fatter.And what's up with doing away with the Chicago Card plus bonus for putting $20 at a time on it?  What's the point now, I might as well pay cash.  It's not like I can go with another mass transit system in Chicago.

The buses are ok.  I had to take one today and was a little surprised that the reroutes for the chicago marathon weren't posted.  This was particularly an issue because the neighborhood where I was (along the 29 state line) seemed pretty dependent on the bus and a lot of little old people were forced to walk blocks and blocks and blocks.  Then when we got closer to my stop, I was listening, but didn't know the route.  In DC, at least, the voice announces the next stop.

230,3,"Aug 2, 2009","As a middle-class resident of West Town, CTA works great for me. I can buy passes at my Blue Line stop, at either of the closest grocery stores, or the Currency Exchange down the street. I have the internet and a credit card, so I can even order a Chicago Card delivered right to my door with no hassle at all. This summer, I took the bus or the train with my students every day. My students are from the real west side, and things weren't so easy for them. To get permits to use their reduced fare passes, they would have needed phone access, a guardian with the time and mobility to find, fill out and submit applications, two dollars, and an address for the permits to be sent to. At least two of those things would have proved insuperable obstacles to most of the children, and they would have spent the summer either indoors or unsupervised. Neither of those options are all that much fun. Chicago summers are amazing because of how many free, fun things happen every day - look at the Millennium Park schedule, the events happening at the library, the beaches, movies in the parks, all the different cultural festivals - but in order to take advantage of these opportunities, you need to use the CTA. We ended up getting passes for all the kids, but no permits. The real reason my students and I had such a wonderful summer was that CTA stations are staffed by human beings. No individual is going to tell a group of schoolkids that they can't go play on the beach with their teachers. I felt bad for putting CTA employees in that position, but I also felt angry that CTA itself made it so incredibly difficult for us to follow the letter of the law.",cta

Raising the fare is maybe the only way to pay the staff a fair wage, and i understand this...but perhaps if money hadn't been mismanaged and quick fixes used for so long we wouldn't be paying for it now. Raising fares, more advertisements, and a gift shop? then why is there a DECREASE in service?p.s. the cta's scam where you HAVE to buy a u-pass unless you are disabled is insane.

Yes, we know life can suck really fast for many people and you never know what could happen and it could happen to you!  For example, in Chicago we were riding the brown or red line, guy comes on and has major sores on his foot due to some infection.  He proceeds to tell the entire car, ""I'm only trying to raise 19$ for some medication for my foot.""  He didn't have insurance, but then again...neither do I.  p.p.s  This story has a happy ending, I hope.  There was a person riding in our car who told the guy that he worked at a hospital and to come to that hospital between certain hours and to ask for him and he'd get him a card so that he could get his medication or get some kind of health card.

Also, it was very easy to get to the Loop and there are several stops you can get off at once you get to the Loop.I highly doubt I'll be as lucky to ride the train like that again, but overall, good experience.I'm not a big fan on the EL - I'm a suburbanite and take the Metra into the city, but if I have to take the EL then I will.Also, I highly recommend buying a day pass sold at Walgreens if you are visiting.

That management crew was then ousted and shamed [by the media & citizens] for their overt and apparent attempt to siphon money from the corporation into their own pockets.  New management under the African-American female [whose name I fail to recall at this time] promised to never raise fares unjustly and without proper notice to the citizens.

Can't seem to find that here.During the past eight years I have been riding the L and haven't had too many problems. About two years ago I was trying to go North to South on the Red Line. The train was half an hour late, so we froze in the Chicago winter. When we finally got on the train it took us forever to get to our destination. They stopped the train for over half an hour because of construction. This happened to me another time trying to go from Midway to O'Hare. Not the best feeling in the world.Like I said, most of my problem is with the website. They make it easy to find your destination on the map; however, they make the process of getting there more complicated than it should be. I can't count how many times they've told me to take the Metra to Blue Line to a bus and walk when it would have cost less and taken less time to just take the Metra all the way downtown. Then, when you want to take a bus, they give you the intersection, but don't mention which side of the street or the direction that you need. For someone not from the area, it can get confusing.Back to the whole Minnesota nice. Too bad it isn't Midwest nice. It clearly didn't migrate south. Some of the CTA drivers are rude as hell. I was trying to get from Des Plaines to the nearest Target. I waited directly under the bus stop sign. Then the driver pulls up and snaps at me, ""You need to give me a signal or something. There are a lot of buses that stop here."" I said, ""OK..."" What the hell? I'm under the friggin' sign, isn't that enough? Then I pulled the chord to get off and asked which way to walk to the shopping center. She gives me some attitude about ""we ain't there yet.."" That wasn't my question. I had the same woman on the way back home. We were waiting for the Metra to pass, so I walked to the front to be able to see where my stop was.

Upon exiting at Clark/Lake, there are helpful signs indicating which way to head for one of the multiple transfer trains. CTA, you need to improve. Where CTA wins kudos: You run 24 hours a day. Way to help the homeless stay warm in the harsh winters!! Cheaper than DC metro. You can buy a monthly pass and it's a flat rate no matter how far you go. Easy to follow bus routes.",cta

It is dirty, often graffiti-ridden, late more than on-time and there are never enough buses on Cubs game days (if you've ever ridden a jam-packed bus with suburban, drunk Cubs fans, you know what I'm talking about).  I am grateful I do not have to rely on a car and for my daily 6:55 AM bus driver on the X80.Yes its money is limited and yes changes are being made.  But it seems too little too late.  For example, if New York, with all its boroughs and one-way streets, can maintain an efficient bus and train system, why can't Chicago?",cta

I'm not sure if this paratransit service is still offered through CTA, or if it was transferred to Pace.  In any case, this is another great service.  While I never used it, my father depended on it to get to work every morning.  The drivers were very nice and polite.The busses...  One of the worst things about the CTA... the crappy service.  CTA busses tend to be very over crowded, always run late (the schedule is a joke), and like to break down because they are old and poorly maintained.  On the other hand, the drivers are overall good people (ok, there are a very small number of assholes, but in 6 years of taking CTA, I've only encountered 2) and do their best.RTA route planner... This service, offered through the CTA web page attempts to give directions.  Its an ok service, but some of the suggested routes suck.

They really need to get it together and figure out a better way to get the buses running.That being said, they are usually clean and I haven't had too many grouchy bus drivers, and I take the blue line to and from O'Hare and that's no problem. It was annoying that when they are working on the slow spots that you have to get off, take a bus to the next station, and then get back on the train... but if in the end it means the train will go quicker, then it will be all worth it, I guess.",cta

It cant be that THAT many more people are riding on certain days...My Theory: I think they have some drivers call in sick and just run less trains some days, leaving us, the paying public, to jam onto them.Today it was a MORE than packed day, to the point i barely got on the 2nd Red line train that went by at the Addison stop. I decided to push and squeezed on to that one bc i knew, in one stop i would have to get off...and transfer to the brown, which ::crossed fingers:: wouldn't be as packed. Well the problem wasn't that that it was packed, its that it decided to NOT SHOW....THREE red line trains went by before a brown. Each packed Red dropping off MORE people to squeeze on to Brown train that is coming 1/3 less times.

Like the time it took me almost 1.5 hours to get home (only 5 miles-and only 15 minutes by car) and then I ended up having to walk the last half mile and it started to sleet on me on the walk home!!But MOST of the time you can get anywhere in the city within an hour. Whether its 2 miles or 12 miles it still usually takes an hour-I know, it mystifies me too but I've grown to accept it.Again, I repeat-MOST of the time. My husband and I only have one car, so for 5 years I've relied on the CTA to get me to work, doctors appointments, school, and much more.... Although I will acknowledge that it's gotten a little ridiculous with all the ""doomsday"" service cuts threats, the fare hikes, etc. I am still grateful the CTA exists and can get me around the city fairly reliably. I've had close friends who have seen violence on the train, I've witnessed masturbation, defecation and urination and obviously experienced solicitation from homeless people and been subject to funky spills (vomit, anyone?) as well as smells. But what 24-hour service that goes ALL over the LARGE and DIVERSE city wouldn't have some of these issues....I try to cut slack where slack is due!Edit (4/22): Yes, I was one of those stuck underground in the blue-line mess last week. Yes, it sucked. No, I'm not afraid of taking the blue line or subway now.

288,3,"Oct 19, 2009","Background: I used to work in city/transit planning in NYC. The CTA, in my opinion, seems like an eager organization (as far as transit operators go) and does a decent job with their limited resources. They are generally pretty friendly, and they clearly put effort into customer service initiatives like Bus Tracker, the crisp automated announcements, and the hoards of customer service reps when they have service changes. American city dwellers in general *love* to complain that America's metros don't run like their European counterparts, but nobody wants to put their money where their mouth is. Take Paris, a city that is roughly the same size (slightly smaller city, slightly larger metro area). The RATP gets $10 billion a year from the government to operate the rapid transit system, while the CTA gets less than 1/7th of that to work with. So if we'd like to increase CTA's operating budget by 750%, I'm sure we too could have pretty stations, shiny new trains, and new lines being built. (In fact, that would be a great thing!) Or, you could pay $8 for a one-way ticket on London's (semi) privatized Underground. That said, I find riding the quirky 'L' to be kind of awesome, kind of like a low-intensity roller coaster ride with great views. The 'L' needs serious expansion, and misses enormous swaths of the city. The CTA really ought to reconsider its line extensions on the Orange and Red and put those efforts into things like the Circle Line to create better interurban connections. Chicago is too spread out already--development should encourage density in the core, not push it even further out.Oh. The farecard vending machines are horrendous.",cta
289,1,"Apr 9, 2015",Passengers beware - it seems that CTA has allowed the blue line  from  O'Hara to turn into a homeless shelter.  This morning @ around 8 am there were  at least 8 homeless men sleeping under blankets in one car.  No effort was made to remove them - Unsafe!!,cta
290,2,"Jun 5, 2009","Though this is the only source of transporation that gets me around Chicago, it is an unreliable and expensive method transporation that is simply unpleasant. CTA trains called the ""L"" are expensive to ride. It costs $2 to ride the bus and $2.25 to ride the train. It is also unreliable in that you never really know when the bus or train is going to arrive. There is a set schedule for arrival times, but the trains never really seem to follow it. The trains are consistently experiencing delays. Many times I have been sitting on the train and the conductor comes on the intercom to once again apologize for the inconvenience and notify us that the train is experiencing technical difficulties. I understand if there are temporary difficulties, but difficulties almost everyday is unacceptable. I sit in the unmoving stopped train car for 10 minutes knowing that this will happen again tomorrow. The buses on the other hand are much more reliable time wise. Other than cost and reliability, the ""L"" is very dirty. The tunnel at Jackson connecting the Red and Blue line smells like urine. They are constantly using chlorine to wash the tunnel floors, but even chlorine cannot cover the unbearable stench. Whenever I have to make the trek across the tunnel I hold my breath walking as fast as I can. Also some of the north side train stops have very little standing room. It is quite scary waiting for the train at those stops, because it seems so easy to fall right into the tracks. Riding the ""L"" is an unpleasant experience and if I were a tourist riding the ""L"" I would have a bad image of Chicago. The CTA really needs to revamp the entire system. But at the end the ""L"" gets me places .... unreliably, making a huge dent in my wallet, and making me want to spray the entire underground system with Lysol and Febreze. Interesting Note - Enjoy the multitalents of the various acts scattered across the different train stations. The Jackson Red line and Blue line stops offers quality entertainment while waiting for the train that never seems to come.",cta

After being there a week, I love every single moment I spent riding the EL trains and the buses to get to other parts of the city. Love the passing by the tall skyscrapers in downtown, riding across the river, and checking out my surroundings of the whole city. It was efficient to ride the Blue and red line trains to Lincoln Park and Chinatown at night. Love that it ran under a 24 hour service on weekends. The bus were a adventure and like that it came on time and didn't have to wait too long for one at all. I like the fact that inserting the fare card inside the fare box was very convenient and I just fell in love with riding it everywhere. My favorite part was hearing the announcer telling passenger what was the next stop and told what station to get off to transfer to different parts of the city. I got myself a week pass and it was definitely a bargain rather then driving into the city and dealing with the insane traffic, overpriced parking rates, and running the risk of being bankrupt by the end of my vacation.

I once saw two men smoking on the train like we were back in the 1930's.The buses are crap. Yes you do feel a little safer on them because they have cameras but they are never on time or coordinated.

I am also very fortunate to live within 50 feet of a bus stop and a few blocks from the nearest L station (Addison Brown Line) which came in handy when I recently lost my car to a dead motor and needed to get around.The CTA isn't the greatest, but I'm glad it's here.",cta

When I informed the driver that I have a Metra train to catch at Fullerton, he told me that I should have left earlier.  I told him to go eff himself. Oh yes, sometimes I think the drivers think it's funny to speed away at the last second when you are running to catch the bus and then you have to wait another 20 minutes for the NEXT one!I hate that you have no bus service on Addison #152 after 10 pm on weeknights and 8:30 on weekends. Kind of defeats the purpose of having mass transit, especially since Addison goes through Wrigleyville where all the bars are and the drunks could use a safe ride home.

I'll also agree that something has to be done about the Blue - O'Hare line. This review is not about just the Blue line however and as a whole the system operates, even if just barely. At least it's a real system - not like the ""trollies"" out here in San Diego.(PS - How appropriate that the CTA is my 300th review. I couldn't even find something local to review.

They shut down major stations for weekends or full months at a time - the red line downtown northbound was closed many weekends, which you don't know until you get in the station.

Based on what it does offer it is way convenient (Why aren't the trains on bus tracker?) , affordable (even with the fare increase it still beats car payments, car insurance, oil changes, parking, gas, and sanity from driving in Chicago), reliable (many 247 buses) and the 'inspiration' for one of the greatest bands of all time (Chicago - originally named Chicago Transit Authority).CTA, I heart you - just add a circle line and I'll give you five stars!",cta

When the weather starts to suck or you're going against the grain during a commute, or at an off time, it can be tough.

Well I waited 30 freakin minutes for the most crowded packed bus ever just to pass me up.  Well, since I do love the CTA I decided just to stick it out and wait for another one...15 minutes later another one shows up, slightly less packed, but still packed.

Sure, a bunch of times some bus lines suck or the El can't run on time, but also a good number of other times, everything works out just fine.  I think that since we're dealing with a psuedo-government agency and one that is, has been, and will be underfunded, the fact that things run on time and you usually have relatively considerate employees (try having their job and see if YOU can even muster a smile), we have to give the CTA some props for being a decent and massive organization.",cta
327,3,"Apr 3, 2010","I was ready to write a bad review and rip CTA to shreds, but this time I cannot do so since they redeemed themselves in this particular situation.In hopes of getting more work done at the office, I left my place about half an hour early.  To hasten my arrival downtown, I planned to hop on either of the two bus lines that roll by my corner.  When a bus arrived, I got on and placed my transit card into the machine.  The card popped out through the back and the display indicated it as invalid.  The driver tried the card again with the same result.  He simply told me that my card was not good.  I knew this couldn't be the case since I monitor the expiration dates of my fares and this one was not slated to go bad until 4/18.  (Note: Although the machine prints the expiration date on the back of the card upon activation, this one, as my luck would have it, was printed over the use by date already on the card and made the exp. date almost unreadable.)  He didn't seem willing to let me stay on without paying in an alternative manner and I wasn't about to pull out my wallet (for the record I did have sufficient cash and money loaded on a Chicago card), so I just got off at the stop on the next block.  Needless to say, I was irritated and more than slightly embarrassed as the bus sped onto outer LSD without me.  A few moments later, a bus for my regular line pulled up.  I was so sure that my card would work properly.  Nope.  The card again read as invalid on this bus' reader.  This time the driver nicely allowed me to stay on without paying another way.  I was so thankful for his mercy on me.  While on this bus, I called the 800 number listed on the back of the crappy fare card.  Surprisingly my wait time to speak to a representative was decent.  No elevator music passed through my eardrums.  After hearing my spiel, the rep simply told me to come to CTA headquarters for a replacement.After work, I walked all the way to 567 Lake.  When I got there, I couldn't get over the spanking new and clean appearance of the building.  There's even an artsy, metal bull in the lobby.  This must be where the funds go - not to the trains, buses and miles of train tracks.  Luckily I got there at a good time since there were two people being assisted and one woman ahead of me.  Again, my wait time was not that long.  When I finally got to the window, the line was growing out the door.  Once I got to the front, I only told a brief version of my troubles, turned in my defective pass and filled out a simple form.  Moments later, the clerk gave me a brand new 30 day pass.  I was excited as this was unexpected.  I only had 16 or so days left on my crap one, so I thought they would give me a combo of weekly and day passes to make up for the owed 16 days.  In the end, I really couldn't have faulted the first driver for not allowing me to stay on without paying since he couldn't read the expiration date.  Thanks for making my trek to 567 Lake worth the walk!  Maybe now CTA can do something about the chicken bones under the train seats or people taking leaks (yes I witnessed that tonight) on the El stairs.",cta

I'd deal with all of that any day the week as long as it meant not having to rely on my car all the freaking time. In Florida, you drive EVERYWHERE, there is no option. If you have no car you suffer, plain and simple.Part of the reason I'm consider relocating to Chicago, (besides the fact that I love the city), is because I'm tired of having no option. Plus, I love riding trains, taking in the scenery, and people watching.Of course this may turn out to be a different story should I actually live there, but as a visitor, I enjoyed my experience with CTA.P.S.

It was quite a savings going public transportation and not dealing with driving and parking....big cities are crazy to drive in.The only negative experience I had was.................only transferring to the Red line going towards 95th which you really need to be careful.  A man was trying to get my attention...asking my how to get to the airport, and probably he was really wanting to rob me.  I'm from the big city, so you learn not to look or talk to people and watch your belongings.The 1 day; 3 day, 7 day passes are a great deal bc you don't need to concern yourself with time limits, or transfers.  it works 24 hours from the time you actually use it and the expiration time and date is on the back of the ticket.Most bus drivers and CTA workers at the stations were all helpful and nice.  There were some bus drivers who seem grumpy, but were willing to assist you.It was great that the CTA public transit system is frequent and covers so many areas.

335,2,"Aug 13, 2008","Can't say I see evidence of a brain behind this stuff. Trains never follow their schedules, things like the CTA trip planner are always off. And buses are just never on time, ever. The smallest, simplest courtesy they could provide is a tiny little electronic display at L stops and major bus stops that would tell you which stop the thing you're waiting for is at. I just hate the feeling of waiting and waiting (and it's happened before that trains have never came, ie canceled service).The whole bus system is archaic and shitily designed. There should be bus waiting zones, so you pay to enter the waiting zone, then when the bus comes you can just get right on (and we avoid the line of 10 people stopping one after the other to find 2 bucks in their wallet). There should also be about 25% as many stops as there are. Buses stop every block because people are too fuckin fat to walk more than a block (wonder where that cheetos smell comes from?), and yes, this often costs an extra traffic light or two every couple of stops, and probably 20 minutes on an hour-long bus trip.Another backwards thing about the CTA is the complete lack of integration with the Metra. Most other cities have easy and convenient transfer points.The second star was for the fact that there is decent 24 hr coverage and it is cheap (w/ the chicago card).",cta

I moved here straight from Dallas, Tx. In other words, I drove for life. What you cannot argue against (well I guess you could, to the point of infinity) is that the CTA still provides Chicago with one of the best public transportation systems in the US. No, it's not NY's rail system, and it never will be unless a billionaire decides to plunk down hundreds of millions of dollars down to build new lines. But that's not the point. It is a rare case that I cannot figure out a way to get to where I'm going via train or bus. I use either the 7-day pass or the 30-day pass, both of which completely negate the ""but it's [x] amount of dollars to use it!"". Yes, the money could be managed better - but if YOU think you can fix the System that *is* the City of Chicago, good luck. If you haven't been in the political machine here for more than ten years, you're not going to make a dent. Here's what I *don't* pay for by using the CTA:gascar insurancetime spent looking for parkingtickets I will note that I have tried owning/using a car twice, each time for more than a couple months, and saw my costs rise in terms of cash flow (out), time and energy wasted. I've lived on the west side, and now live on the north side. I've had to get to everywhere from Midway to OHare to literally hundreds of places in-between. The CTA, with all its faults, still exists, still functions, and still gets me to where I need to go for an average of $80 or less a month. Without it, I can't get to work, I would have a harder time meeting friends, and I would have seen less of the city. BTW - if you think the system was built as a joke, you really don't f**king know your Chicago history. You also haven't paid attention to what the car companies did in the West and South - they bought up the electric and non-electric rails systems and tore them up in order to sell buses they made to whatever city they wanted to ""compete"" for in the public transportation sector. It's in our history books, its documented in court proceedings and investigations, and it's why we don't have more cities with better public transportation systems. So no, Chicago's system wasn't set up as a joke, but as a means of getting people to where they wanted to be to where they were needed (from home to downtown). Wake up.",cta

To put some perspective on this, I come from a city that has no practical public transit system (Houston, TX).  So, when I travel to other cities with decent public transit options, I simply fall under a powerful spell.  While the spell is potent, it is not complete.  Most of the buses are relatively clean but I'd wash hands at the first chance.  Most of the elevated lines are noisy inside the train, standing outside underneath on the street, or on the platform.  The subway stations are dirty and noisy - I wouldn't eat off the floor and I'd pause before picking up anything that fell on the ground.  ""Do I really need that?"" would be my question.  All of it is pretty old and gritty except for the Brown and Green lines.  Everyone uses the system to get around.But, all a great bargain at $2.25 for a full-priced ride.  I cashed in further by buying a 3-day pass for $14 at the airport.  A great value to reacquaint myself with Chicago since my last visit was about 12 years ago.  They have 1-day, 7-day, and 30-day passes, too.On a whirlwind bromance with Chicago over a long weekend, I saw/did the following items during my 2.5 days with an assist from the CTA's mix of buses, subway, and elevated trains:* Took the Blue line from O'Hare into the city to the hotel.* Took the Brown line to the Paulina station for lunch at Pho's Hot and Spicy Thai.* Hitched a ride on the 152 Addison bus afterwards and jumped off in front of Wrigley Field while the Cubs home stand was going on.* Viewed the Art Institute, Millennium Park, and the Cloud Gate sculpture (aka the Bean).* Took the 12 Roosevelt bus to University of Illinois-Chicago to Jim's Original Hot Dog where I learned to eat off an outside ledge like the locals.* Picked up a free map with all of the bus lines at the Chicago Waterworks Visitor Center.  (You can also get one at the Chicago Cultural Center.)* Checked out the Buckminster Fuller and Alexander Calder exhibits at the Museum of Contemporary Art.* Rode the 151 Sheridan through Lincoln Park to the Halsted terminus.* Rode the Red line north to Loyola station then the 155 bus along Devon Avenue for an Indian lunch at Viceroy.* Met fellow awesome Yelper, Jenny H, at the Diversey Brown line station then we took the 76 Diversey bus to Hot Doug's http://www.yelp.com/biz/hot-dougs-chicago on Saturday.  We were first in line at 10 AM.* Took the Green line out to Oak Park to check out the Unity Temple, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright.  http://www.yelp.com/biz/unity-temple-unitarian-universalist-congregation-oak-park* Ended up by mistake at the Garfield station when I hopped on the wrong bus and the driver didn't notice I was still on his bus as he headed towards the garage on the south side.  Luckily, we spotted the error in time for him to pull off the freeway to make an impromptu stop outside this rail station for my repatriation back to the city.  (Lesson learned:  Do not be the last passenger on a route.  Or, be sure to make a lot of noise.  So much for blending in.)While my Chicago Yelp colleagues may have a love-hate relationship with the CTA, I'm a fan.  It got me around the city and allowed me to see a wonderful variety of neighborhoods (some pretty, some not) and people (some pretty, some not, some simply stunning).

I found out that I should go online and ""replace"" the card and opt to pick a new one up the next day.  *I* should do this.  Fine.  I went online.

355,4,"Dec 1, 2009","The CTA gets a bad rap, methinks. For those of you weighing the benefits of taking mass transit vs. driving, consider this.   -  You get where you want to go probably a little slower - unless you're on the train when it's snowing. Snow ain't no match for steel on steel. Traffic on the roads = standstill.  -  So you've gotten there 10 minutes later than your driving counterparts, but guess what? You hop off the train or bus and you're there. Hey man, have fun driving around looking for a parking space for your car for 20 minutes before having to pay for parking. I'm already on my second beer and I just gave away your seat.  -  Oh, you can't drink because you've gotta drive home? Ha! Night owl buses and trains rule. And late night, they're hilarious. But sometimes sketchy. Which is sometimes hilarious.   -  Yeah, sometimes the tracks get re-routed and you've gotta re-plan for stuff. Good thing you've got that invincible car that NEVER goes on the blink and needs to be repaired which NEVER costs you hundreds of extra dollars.Look, I've ridden public transit in many American cities, and Chicago has it good. Is it going to be as convenient as the NYC subways? Not quite. But in terms of ease of use and cleanliness, the CTA is pretty darn good. As far as trains (or buses) being dirty, I'm not sure what lines you're riding (I'm a regular on Brown-Red-Orange-Blue, in that order), but they're not bad. Gross things happen. You live in a city. It'll be okay, just watch what you sit in. I'm car-free for the first time in my adult life, and I love it.",cta
356,3,"Feb 11, 2017","The good: Thanks to the CTA, getting around Chicago without a car is not only possible, it is cheaper than using a car and paying for gas, parking, insurance and repairs. With connecting buses and trains all over the city, planning a trip is simple and quick. Actually taking that trip, however, is another story.The bad: While I have come across many kind, intelligent and helpful CTA drivers, there are also those bad apples who make a civilized person question the collective morality of humanity itself. Sadly, those bad apples are becoming more and more prevalent, while the decent human beings are being shoved out of the way. So that kindly bus driver who took the extra time to check and make sure that the person in the wheelchair was strapped in, comfortable and happy? Sadly, she is becoming a rarity among drivers, while the basic decency that we all should expect becomes such an uncommon thing that we feel the need to applaud such humanity when we come across it.  Just in the last week:A driver passed up  group of people, who then began running after the bus and shouting for him to stop. Not only did he fail to stop, he saw them standing there, saw them waving their arms, heard them shouting (we all did) and he just kept on driving without any expression on his face. Another driver was quite rude to, and short with, an older woman using a walker. He kept huffing and puffing as she tried to get on the bus, and then, in a frustrated and impatient snit, gruffly told her to hurry up. Then, he began driving away even before she was able to sit down, to the point where she began to wobble a bit as if she were going to fall. Luckily she was not injured, but the next time, a disabled person might not be so lucky. The above-mentioned bus driver is the same person who shouted at a man who tried to get off the bus in the back. The man pulled the ""stop request cord"" and the bus did stop - but only to pick up other passengers. The driver never opened the back door. So when he began driving again without letting the man off, the man had to shout to be let out. The driver then became angry and shouted at the man to hurry up, telling him that he should have paid attention, which is ironic, because the man did pay attention; it was the driver who did not. Back door issues seem to be happening more and more as drivers fail to acknowledge the ""stop requested"" notification when someone wants to get off. In another situation, a man pulled the cord to request a stop. The driver stopped, but only to let other people on. He then took off without letting the man off the bus. The man, who was attempting to get out the back door because the front of the bus was crowded with baggage and a wheelchair, shouted for the driver to let him out, which of course did not happen. He ended up having to run to the front of the bus and demand to be let off. The driver finally let him off, after saying nothing, admitting nothing, and staring with an almost puzzled expression at the man, as if the driver could not comprehend what the man was saying, doing or requesting. This lack of comprehension makes me wonder if the CTA hires just anyone who walks through their door, regardless of intelligence or cognitive ability. And then there was yet another situation where the driver failed to let someone out the back door. Again, the front was pretty full so for people sitting in the back, using the back door is the best option. A woman pulled the ""stop request"" cord to be let out at the next stop. The driver slowed down just a bit as if he was going to stop, but he was clearly only doing so to let people on the bus. When he realized they did not want to get on, he just kept going. The woman shouted for him to stop and he did not. So, the woman pulled the cord again for him to stop at the next bus stop. He stopped, let other people on, and did not let her out the back door. He then took off, and the woman shouted even louder at him to STOP. Everyone on the bus looked confused, and other people began questioning what his problem was, that this woman has now tried twice to get off the bus and twice this driver failed to let her off. Finally, because of the commotion, the driver stopped and let the woman off, as well as a few other frustrated passengers. The driver had absolutely no expression on his face for the entire time, though I thought I could make out a smug little grin. Maybe I just imagined it. Also, the change to cloth seats, from the plastic variety, was a pretty bad idea. First of all, it is obvious when plastic is wet, while it isn't always obvious when cloth is wet. I'm sure you get where I'm going with this. Also, plastic is easier to clean, simply wipe it down with some sort of cleaning solution, where as cloth requires an actual shampooing with equipment. The CTA is a necessity for many of us living in the city, and I for one am grateful for it. But improvements are in order.",cta

Where else can you ride around looking into people living rooms from the tracks.  The El takes you everywhere for $2, including the airport, and most lines run 24 hours.

363,3,"Jun 23, 2009",I'll break it down to you and give it my personal stars for every part of the service. 5 stars because it gets me to where I need to. 5 stars because they now have hybrid buses. That's all the 5 stars they get. everything else about it pretty much sucks. It seems like the drivers make up their own schedules. I use google maps or their bus schedules to show me what time the bus is supposed to leave the bus station or pick me up at a particular stop. I use the Jefferson Park terminal everyday to get home from work.I was testing the google maps transit schedule to see if my 56 Milwaukee bus would leave at like 9:40 pm. Sure enough it was late because the driver came from eating at McDonald's because he had his McDonald bag with him. Also if the driver leaves earlier then the schedule says we all have to suffer on the bus because the drivers will sometimes sit at a bus stop for 5 minutes because they are making up the time. Oh and the 80 Irving Park route sucks too because when they arrive at Irving Park and Central they sometimes have to wait for a new driver to take over the route and one day a few years back we had to wait over a half hour for the new driver. Other buses wouldn't pick us up. Most of the drivers are rude as hell.You can't complain to them because they will yell at you back. They have been working on the EL tracks for years. They said the work would of been all done last winter but it seems like they are starting all over again. i have one more story. I bought a 7 day bus pass and it worked for a couple of days and after a couple of days it wouldn't work. It would say invalid everytime I put it in the slot. All the drivers let me on anyways but there was one driver who wouldn't let me ride. I even showed him that it didn't expire yet but you couldn't tell because the ink that they use to print out the expiration date smeared up. He threatened to call the police on me if I didn't either pay or get off. So that is my review about the CTA.,cta

Fare is totally reasonable... at home (bay area), you pay by distance on the subway... it's a good four bucks to get from Berkeley to SF. A $2 flat fee is nothing, especially when you consider you can transfer b/t lines for free... get from one side of the city to the other? That's a deal. Plus unlimited monthly passes, good for the El and busses, are very reasonably priced if you take public transportation daily (which most of us without cars who aren't hermits do).I mean, c'mon, most lines run all night. Yeah, it sucks that they run somewhat slower than during the day.You know what sucks more? Bay Area trains stop running at 12:30. Get to the station in SF after a show at 12:35? Gotta fork up cash for a taxi. A lot of busses stop running at 9PM. The rest stop running at 12:30. There're three lines in the entire east bay that run at night, they come every 20-45 minutes. That sucks.Back in the olde country, you practically have to be a semi-retarded amputee carrying a newborn and two bags of groceries for someone to yield their seat.

368,1,"Aug 23, 2007","I'm trying to think what the CTA deserves one star for....ummm, I can't think of anything.  The following are just a few events that took place in the past two weeks. 1) Mon, Aug 13th p.m. rush- #146 bus breaks down between Addison and Irving.  I took this bus only because I wanted a seat and some air conditioning.  Usually I'd take the #147, but they seem to have a worse rate of break-down this summer anyway.    A #151 comes and instead of waiting for another #146, a few of us think, what the hell, it's better than standing here, waiting and waiting.  But oh nooooo...the #151 bus driver has another idea.  She argues with us that when a bus breaks down, you can't get on another bus route because of some stupid-a$$ rule.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but hasn't the CTA already gotten my fare, and in return, failed to take me to my destination?  Shouldn't I be compensated by being allowed on a bus that will get me there...eventually...even if it is on the slower-than-slow route that the #151 is.  Thankfully the #146 bus driver argued our case and we were allowed on, not after making the rest of the #151 riders annoyed for delaying their commute though. 2) Wed, Aug 15th a.m. rush- Get on an empty #144 bus at Sheridan and Berwyn.  The bus turns the corner onto Foster, collects about 10 more people and then after watching the bus driver and the supervisor talk and point at the back of the bus for about 10 minutes, the driver tells us to get off where we find the back of the bus leaking like the proverbially ""cow on a flat rock"".  Now tell me...HOW did this bus even get out of the bus yard in the first place?  It was clear that when the bus driver picked me up, that it was his first stop for the day.  The bus route number had to be set, buttons pushed, etc. So how, after turning the corner did he all of a sudden realize there was fluid leaking out of the back? ANd if he didn't realize...shouldn't he have, instead of getting us on the bus and then tossing us off to catch another one.  Because that's all we have to do in the morning is get on and off buses in an attempt to get to work. 3) Thurs Aug 16th p.m. rush- Chicago Card Plus fare card stops working out of the clear blue.  No cracks, no scratches, no reason.  I didn't tap dance on it, use it to scrape ice off a windshield, or try to put it in an ATM machine.  But it was safely tucked away in a little bus card holder, in a pocket of my tote bag... THAT must be it!!!  OR, maybe it's that pesky polar magnetic field reversal thingy going on?  That's it though, the card is kaput and I have to order a new one. I'll use my husband's for the time being....stay tuned for more on the fare card. 4) Sat - Aug 18th - Air & Water Show weekend - So I realize buses will be more crowded this weekend and a commute could take longer. I leave Foster & Sheridan at 10:00 a.m. with the hopes of arriving at DIversey and Clark at 11:30.  I wait for about 15 mins for the Foster bus, then decide to walk to Clark.  At Clark, the bus stop is crowded, not a good sign. I walk down a block and then another and after waiting at least a half an hour for the the bus, one comes that is so crammed packed you couldn't squeeze a piece of paper onto it. It's 11:15 at this point, so I give up and take a cab.  The point is, with a major function going on in the city and huge crowds anticipated making the trek toward the air & water show, shouldn't the service be amped up??  I mean after all, all the media keeps saying ""take public transportation, it's the best bet to get there?  Yeah, right!  Maybe the CTA didn't know there was an event going on.  4) MondAug 20th p.m. rush - #147 bus breaks down on Michigan avenue in front of the Hancock.  Yippee, we all had to pack onto an already crowded #147 5) WedAug 22 p.m. rush - I got on a #144 that not only didn't have any air conditioning, but most of the windows were screwed shut, presumably because they don't stay shut when you want them to.  Not like buses leak or anything in the rain...ahem...that's another story altogether.  Ever sit on a completely wet fabric seat first thing in the morning.  One can only hope that it WAS indeed from rain.  Anyway, the no air bus was on a 90+ degree, 100% humidity day.  Thought I was going to pass out. 6) Thurs Aug 23rd a.m. rush - Husband's Chicago Card Plus craps out, so now I have to pay with cash.  And the money on his card, even though it's under my account, can't be transferred to my card.  Of course the card was just topped up yesterday, so unless I want to lose that money, I've got to order ANOTHER card, because these cards never crap out when you have only a couple of dollars on them.  hmmmmm.  Oh, and don't forget the $5 fee to replace the card....so that's $10 in one week, for two cards that have to be replaced. I just get more and more irritated with the CTA, especially in the face of the proposed fare increases and route eliminations.",cta

My ID, that was pain (think getting around Chi town during NATO), the credit cards a real pain and the wad of cash, more than $200... what can you say?  I knew they were gone but as a last effort called CTA.   AND THEY HAD IT!!!!  I had to go out to Kedzie to , along way for a guy who lives downtown.  Everyone that I spoke to there was so nice, the security guy walked me to the office, while I waited 3 people POLITELY asked if I had been helped.

370,5,"Sep 25, 2010","Everyone has an opinion, and I respect that. Seems like quite a few people here don't like the CTA. I love it. As you can see, I come from Las Vegas. A public transit user's nightmare.Miss the bus in Chicago? A lot of the time your wait for the next one won't be any longer than 15 minutes. Miss the bus in Vegas? You're screwed. There's only about 8-12 bus lines which take less than 30 minutes between their runs (one of those is The Strip. 2 or 3 of them mostly serve the ghetto. Wow). The rest of them take at least 30 minutes (Some of them take 45 minutes or even a whole entire hour). I would go into other examples, but I don't want to bore anyone in the audience or get so pissed off thinking about my frustrations with the RTC that I throw my laptop into the wall as hard as I possibly can. The CTA is awesome in my opinion. The majority of buses run very frequently and none of the stops are too far away from each other or have useless locations. The eL is amazing, perfect way to explore the city since it's above ground and much easier than having to ride several different buses if you want to go somewhere on a different side of the city.The day passes may seem at little steep with no other basis but are totally worth it once you realize how good the service is. I regularly pay $5.00 for a day pass in Las Vegas (75 cents less than Chicago) and I honestly think that's the biggest rip off in the world with how infrequent, unreliable and generally bad it is. Not only that but they have several express buses which stop at various city landmarks, perfect for tourism. I definitely am biased seeing that I just compare everything to the godawful public transit they have where I live but I really cannot shower the CTA with enough praise.

After a few days, I checked and they were charging me per ride. I called and spoke to a rep and she said, 'You tricked the system'  But my account said '30 day pass' at 9:52am on 1/13 and I didn't take a ride till 10:27am that day.

It is 2/8 and I haven't heard a thing.  Terrible customer service.I doubt I will ever get the refund I'm entitled to.  I have followed-up twice through the Chicago Card Plus website and have referenced my case number each time. CTA, without doubt,  is an unmitigated mess. Also, in case you don't know. CTA raised the price of the monthly pass from $86.00 to $100.00 based on data that their computer system retrieved showing that the majority of the monthly pass users lived on the North Side along the Lake.

Anyone who has travelled exensively to other big cities around the nation/world quickly realizes that our transit system is pretty sad - with some exceptions on the newer lines, much of our city rail system is operating on an infrastructure that was designed over 100 years ago and hasn't changed a whole lot since then. Even more ""modern"" components such as fare card machines break down with frustrating regularity. Folks in the downtown & lakeshore areas are most fortunate, as they have many rail/bus options and more frequent service, but as you move farther from the lake & away from the major train lines, you are almost always better off driving, cycling, or just walking.",cta

381,3,"Feb 20, 2017","Chicago Transit AuthorityI've been riding the CTA since I could remember. My grandmother can't drive. For years during every weekend when I would stay with her and we would ride the bus and go on an adventure. As a child, riding the bus was fun and adventurous. But as I got older and began to ride the bus it became a reality. It's just a public transportation system. It's not perfect and it's not horrible.  Maybe my judgement was clouded from my childlike mind and the buses have always been the same. But today much of the CTA climate has changed for better and for worse. In order to be an effecient and avid rider of the CTA riders should be able to acclimate to tight spaces, close proximity to others, slow routes. Many of the more popular lines going downtown are crowded especially the trains. The CTA buses are much better than they used to be although some of the newer design choices are questionable. Many old buses with the ""too small seats"" and cramped aisle are still in use today. But most of the buses going around are modern with the automatic doors, proper heating and cooling, wide and comfortable seats, and equipped with a better Ventra card reader. These more modern buses are very comfortable and pleasant to ride on. So after a long day it would be relatively comfortable to ride on the train or bus going home. However, there is one very new model of the CTA buses where the seats are made out of a plastic like material without padding, compared to the older seats these are worst. I've gotten on the bus during a rainy and snow day and you'll find passengers sliding out of the seat struggling to just sit up. These seats are impossible for little children to sit in without getting injured. CTA buses and trains use a new modern card system called Ventra. You can automatically load your Ventra card with the app on your phone and it's very easy and modern compared to most public buses in other cities.  To use the card on the buses and trains you just tap it and go. The downside is the card can be faulty so CTA riders should have backup dollars because no one will have change. I've seen passengers get kicked off the bus in terrible weather because of there card being faulty on Ventra's part.  Overall the CTA is a great means of public transportation around Chicago. It is relatively efficient and saves a lot of money from driving and car services like Uber, especially when going to places like Downtown Chicago everyday.",cta

It's a great train for those who live in Pilsen and beyond to get quickly into the Loop instead of going on the Blue Line underground.

Well, they're getting better since management changed, but the CTA has yet to find that happy balance between early and late, as the media is always quick to report.Clean. If you consider ""smelling of bizarre industrial cleanser"" clean. Now if they could get rid of the disgusting felt seats, we'd be in business.Safe. Not so much. Anyone who has ever been subjected to a ""why my life sucks and you should give me money"" speech from someone who has the distinct rattle of pills about them will likely agree.Friendly. I've had a handful of friendly bus drivers, and I'm sure working for the CTA means oodles of stupid questions from directionally and life-challenged individuals. Most employees I've seen have a distinct  ""please let the torture end soon"" look about them. Probably because they've got passengers who attempt to exit a rapidly moving vehicle on a frighteningly regular basis.We must all pause to remember that not everyone has a transit system like we do in Chicago, and management seems to be legitimately trying to make it better.

391,1,"Nov 5, 2012","Today I watched with horror as my Chicago Card slid from my hands on the Francisco platform and onto the tracks. Seeing as it is a ground level station I figured I could, at the very least, make the station attendant aware of the situation and possibly retrieve my card at a later time. Instead, what I got was a lengthy lecture on how this happens all the time, how this employee is old and can't just jump down onto the tracks anymore, how I needed to swipe my card, place it into my wallet and then proceed through the turnstile and so on... basically I was berated and treated like an annoyance. As we walked to the opposite end of the platform (Francisco has a North and South entrance) I was lectured non-stop. When I showed the employee where the card was - a mere 5 feet inside the crossing entrance - I offered to stand on the platform at it's location as a visual queue to the employee. Instead I was yelled at and told to stand at the gate so I could let them back in. Guess what, the employee walked 15 feet past the card and loudly complained that he couldn't find the card. So much for trying to be proactive and helpful, right?Great customer service CTA. I work with client's all day and I don't lecture them about my personal likes and dislikes, nor do I give them a piece of my mind because, god forbid, I have to get out of my seat at my desk to assist them. It's part of my job! And, guess what CTA, your customers are individuals and don't appreciate being clumped together into a group set aside for general spite and malicious commentary. You work in an industry that sees hundreds of thousands of people a day, so things are going to happen and they're going to often times be similar in nature. But that doesn't give you the right to berate your customers.If the CTA had a policy in place where they don't retrieve cards from the tracks, but instead give the customer instructions on how to deactivate the card and request a new one - then I would have understood and followed suite. What I don't need is belittlement and hand slapping at the hands of your employees for an honest error.",cta

I have taken my friends, my 72 year old mother - I even make my friends take the el to my home from O'Hare, picking them up at the Irving Park stop.I have watched people puke and sleep and eat and beg for money and LIVE on the el. But my patience is wearing thin.  1.  Does it really have to take me 45-60 min to go 9 miles from the Brown Line Francisco stop to the loop?  Really?  Seriously?2.  I have a Chicago Plus Card. I supported you on this venture. But my company hands out CTA checks to supplement our transit costs.  The ONLY place in the city to my knowledge where we can go to put the check on our Plus Card is at your Lake Street office.  Honest to god? Not even Jewel or Dom's can be set up to accommodate this? We have to march our ass to Lake and Jefferson?  3.  Again - the Chgo Plus Card.  I can't check my balance at the kiosks in the stations? I have to do it online?4.  The personnel at the Lake St office have about as much personality as a Qtip. They are often rude, condescending and surly. I have noticed - this KILLS me - that for the last year they have now posted signs at each window ""Please wait to be called to the window."" Why? So they can continue talking on the phone and filing their nails? And WHY are there always closed windows when there are people in line - especially at lunch time?I have saved my most recent bitch for last - your new idea to remove seats from the Brown Line cars so as to accommodate more riders.  What is this - Japan? Are you soon going to have workers whose job it is to stand at each station and push everyone onto the train? Go to Youtube to see this high tech approach.  Or, wait - maybe you already did.Tonight was my first experience with this new endeavor.  I got on the Brown Line at Madison and Wabash at 5:20 pm and I had to stand for the next 50 minutes until I got to Francisco - 2 stops from the end of the line. Unless every Chicagoan loses 65 lbs, I do not believe that making most of us stand will help more people fit on the car. I looked around me - and most everyone looked tired and pissed as hell.

I want to get in...buy my tourist pass...and ""be out""!I would use the regular machine, but I don't want to buy a ""buy the ride"" card as the tourist card is more economical.Over the trip on the Orange line from Downtown to the loop, is easy, quick, economical and pretty much uneventful.  It's certainly better than renting a car and trying to find parking or using a parking garage especially if the majority of the things you plan to do are withing a few miles radius of the loop.  Transit and walking a definitely your best bet.If you're going to buy a transit card at Midway, please be advised you might have to wait in line to purchase.  There are ""regular"" machine, and machines that dispense, ""visitor"" passes.  Most machines take credit cards.

394,2,"Nov 1, 2010","I have such mixed feelings about the CTA. I take the 156 daily to and from work, and other buses as needed. I take the train less often, but I've commuted on it in the past, and still use it occasionally.Even though the prices keep going up, it's still less than a cab or parking, so I won't complain about that. Sometimes the buses or trains break down and make me late for work, but that's just life, so I won't complain about that. In the snow sometimes there are great delays and you're waiting in the freezing cold for a long time, but that's Chicago weather, so I won't complain about that. There are a few things that I will complain about, though as a general rule I hate complainers. There is just no consistency to the ""bus driver rules"". I've been on buses that are so packed people are literally stuffed up against the front door and have to move at stops to allow the door to open. Once the driver apologized and said she was required to stop at every stop no matter what, and it was up to the rider if they wanted to/could squeeze onto the bus. I've also been on buses where the driver adamantly obeys the ""behind the yellow line rule"" and says if the bus is full with everyone at the line, they don't stop at new stops unless someone wants to get off. Both sound plausible to me, but they are polar opposites, who is lying to me? I've had numerous instances where I pull the stop cord, hear the ding, and see ""Stop Requested"" flash on the screen by the driver, and they still don't stop at my stop. I've often been standing at a stop (I take the 156) when the 151 is picking up passengers. Then the 156 drives by and sees the bus there and passes it, quickly en route to the next stop, not caring about those of us waiting at THIS stop, like if the 151 isn't good enough for us, we're out of luck. This doesn't always happen, but often enough. I've also been standing at a bus stop more than once with no other bus around, and had the bus driver just cruise right by me. Sometimes they see me and stop up ahead, letting me run through traffic in the busy street to climb on. Sometimes they are so oblivious they just keep cruising. Am I crazy, or is noticing riders waiting at stops a big park of bus driving? I've been on a bus as it pulls away from a stop, and someone comes running up banging on the door. The bus is now 3 feet from the stop where the person stands, looking forlorn and late, and the drivers don't stop. I tried to find online if there is some bill of rights for CTA passengers like when you're in a cab, and it turns out we have no rights. And I find no information about the so-called rules that various drivers have told me about, all being different. I'll continue to take the bus...because I have no other options. But it's a shame some drivers seem to get great thrills from their power over us. Ruling this commuting world. Truly, what could we do that would affect them? Writing a review seems to be my only option. I have emailed the CTA before (a few times) and I've never heard back. I know I've said this in like...a million other reviews (or at least one), with unemployment so high, find people who will do the job AND be friendly. Or warn drivers they also need to be pleasant or their jobs are at risk. One tip: if you smile sweetly and greet your driver with a good morning, good afternoon, or good evening; it does seem to make their day. I bet half their grump is from a complete lack of appreciation.",cta

You definitely get a nice old city feel as you walk around the loop and see and walk under the old raised tracks.  As we headed out and back to Ohare we had to wait a bit longer than I'd like for a blue line heading in that direction, but I guess you can't ask for much on a Sunday morning.

I use the Blue Line regularly, and admittedly do need to get a Chicago Card, but the more elegant system that New York's MTA and San Francisco's MUNI for example have worked out is to allow fare purchase by credit.  This city is vying for an olympic bid, but they can't even make their public transportation convenient for the casual rider?  I've also been long disappointed by their spotty service record, having waited up to 45 minutes for a bus before I ended up calling a taxi.  They just rolled out some new system where you can track how far off the next bus is to you, but not all lines are added, and I've yet to see it in use.  I applaud their effort to keep up with technology, but in this instance it is only because they are implementing a system where newer buses outfitted with flat-panel TVs will be able to target  advertisements to specific neighborhoods based on their GPS location.

Chicago is extremely dangerous and corrupt. The city is going bankrupt it recently closed 55 schools in the intercity.

I was pleased to be able to keep my morning coffee with me as I went through the turnstile.  Word of advice to other tourists.  Express machines will only add a minimum of $5 to your fare card.

In theory, if they could somehow figure out how to surf the Net without removing their noses from the King's puckered aperture, they might be able to learn at least as much about how to run a major city transport system as Wikipedia has to offer, but there is no evidence that this has happened, not with Kruesi and not with Kruesi #2.

431,1,"May 20, 2015","I believe that whoever is charge of the CTA should take a long look at revamping the fare system.  First of all if you want to attract new passengers you must give them an incentive to ride.  One incentive is to carry over transfers & eliminate the 2 hour expiration.  Many times I only need to take one bus & trip, yet waste money on transfers I don't need.    $2.25 is pretty steep for people who are out of jobs & it quickly depletes their cash.  Perhaps CTA could make a provision for individuals who need transportation for job interviews.  Right now the IDES has this requirement that job seekers attend school.  School is not going to put cash in their pocket so their focus should really be on getting to & from their interview places that are outside of Chicago.Yes Governor Rauner you can have a hand at this too & stop the reductions & cuts you love to implement.

Plus, it's a Chicago icon.",cta

How is it that countries and continents ages older than this one (SO progressive & new) offer far better public transportation?Years of practice I suppose.I've spent years trying to be forgiving of the trains that never come, the nearly empty buses that blow by as if all the people lined up on the rainy/snowy/windy/stormy/freezing cold street are invisible, the continually unexplained fare hikes, the less than informed drivers, and the out of order card machines.

I'm thrilled that an even larger portion of my paycheck can go toward supporting freeloading senior citizens and retired CTA employees with bloated pensions. Best of all, thanks to the $6 I'll have to pay for a round-trip on the El, you'll be able to continue overpaying the 9,000 remaining union employees, even though most of them are outrageously bad at their jobs. And to top it all off, I'll get to stand out in the cold for even longer while I wait for buses and trains that will run even less frequently.That's awesome, CTA. It really is.

First, why can't the #22 have decent buses?  It runs from Polk to Howard, a HUGE run, yet we've got some of the oldest, crappiest buses out there.  Maybe they can give us some of those nice tourist buses, those express ones that are being cancelled.  While most of my bus drivers have been pleasant, I'd love for certain ones to get a refresher course in how not to give your passengers motion sickness by slamming the brake every   half-block.  Also, whoever said to cut out bus stops is totally right.  Why do we have stops at almost every street in River North/Lincoln Park/etc.?  It's ridiculous.

Bus drivers will drive right by you, lie to you about what stops they're making, and some of them are downright racist. Which I hate to say, but it's definitely true.B. The Train - The delays are ridiculous and I get tired of trying to figure out which stops aren't going NB for a day, etc. My worst train experience came from being stalked by a homeless man to 2 train cars, and no one helped me. I got off at the Belmont stop (red line) and walked past 2 different CTA employees. This homeless man was quite OBVIOUSLY following me (hiding behind things and staring at me, following me when I moved).

I partially blame myself on this one, but seriously CTA gift store, get your act together. I placed an order for a poster that was listed as in stock on 12/11/12. Plenty of time for the USPS to deliver it to me in the standard first class mail shipping time. Today, as I'm just beginning to wonder where my package is, and why it's still listed as ""in process"" in my account, I get an email saying:""I am writing with an update on your order as the print is not in stock at the moment in our warehouse and would not arrive until after Christmas. I wanted to give you the option to change to one of our Quick Ship items which would arrive before Christmas of to check if we were ok with post holiday delivery.""Typos aside, this email is still appalling. Because it came to me a full 8 days after I placed the order. I understand that things can go out of stock, but normally don't you figure that out a day or maybe even two after the order was placed?? I now have to scramble to find something else, and those quick ship gifts did not compare to the poster I originally selected. Again, I should have known better, but CTA, you should be embarrassed. While I appreciate do the offer of allowing me to switch my item, which probably shows you realize you screwed me over, I'm waiting on a response about how I can cancel the order.

461,3,"Apr 7, 2015","Hmm where do I start. I see many people complaining about how slow CTA is when they are in a hurry but reality is if you are on a timed schedule you need to leave early and take into consideration that there maybe something that may make you late. Like a late bus or problems with CTA systems etc. YOU have to be responsible enough to leave earlier than what you are leaving now to ensure you will be on time to where ever you are going duhhh. Anyways they only thing wrong with CTA is the employees I don't even know how half of them are keeping their jobs. I say hello to every employee I come across when boarding the bus some say hello back and others don't. Today I got on the 53A and said hello, the man driving the bus looked at me up and down gave me a dirty look and looked away. I just said ''okay."" Then the last stop is the 31st terminal and he stated customers can not get dropped off in the terminal which is complete bs because I take that bus every day and always go into the terminal. So I argued with him not because he was kicking me off but because he was lying and was completely rude! I come across people like this daily which is sad because this is a CUSTOMER SERVICE JOB, so if you don't like customers then this is clearly not a job for you and you should start looking for another one. Simple. Besides complaining about workers, if you are looking for a affordable and easy way to get around Chicago then CTA is good for you. :)",cta

I've been rained on by leaky escape hatches in the ceiling, spit-up on by babies who can't handle the bumpiness of Division St near Cabrini Green, spilled on, grinded on... and the list goes on.  However I do feel that the bus service has spruced up on my routes, I never have to wait long for the Blue line, and bus service has gotten quite better as well.  Customer Service can use a few more training courses, but we know that that Chicago attitude is going to come out when cornered either way.  I know mine does!  I find myself on the side of the bus drivers more often - calling in complaints on cabs who make my morning coffee spill, and who make me bounce a seat up when they cut us off and the bus tries to pop a wheelie!  In a nutshell, the CTA isn't that bad for me anymore.  I know I'll be right here again, updating on all my experiences!",cta
465,3,"Mar 13, 2007","Convenient and can take you anywhere in the city you want to go.  BUT the bus routes are quite illogical and it would make more sense to run in agrid pattern instead of having eight different Michigan Avenue routes that turn in different areas or weave in and out of streets going east and west.  Many CTA workers have no knowledge of how to get from one place to another if you ask, some times there tend to be many technical problems.  The last three times I rodethe train, the train stopped for no good reason for 20-45 minutes depending on the day.  And last time, it stopped for about 35 minutes with no reason and I had a plane to catch. I am convinced that CTA cannot keep a schedule if they stapled one to their ass three hundred times, and it often gets quite dirty, moldy, and stinky.  I couldn't tell you how many times I rode and saw ridiculous people spitting wads of sunflower seeds on the floor and already saw a cup of pudding spilled and smeared all over a seat before 8am.  Friggin pudding on a seat before 8?  What the hell is that about?  Oh and you gotta love those panhandlers with the shell game claiming to be from the CTA recreational department.

466,3,"Mar 25, 2006","The CTA has suffered from funding issues and image problems in the past, but they are working hard to fix their budget and route issues. Overall, I'm fairly pleased with the public transportation system: it thoroughly blankets the city, and you are rarely more than a couple blocks' walk from a bus or train line. During rush hour, the red line is a bit notorious for running slow. There are certainly some colorful weirdos on the train lines (there seems to be less weird people on the buses, but they exist in both places) - share your nutty CTA stories at www.ctatattler.com - but coming from a part of the country where there was no public transportation, I really like the ""L"". Most of the time I feel pretty safe using it, but, like any big city public transit system, you should use common sense and safety measures, especially later at night. The best value, due to the new raise in fares ($2 for cash fare) is the CTA card, which looks like a credit card, but you pre-load it online, and using it gives you the old fare cost of $1.75.

Nonetheless, there is a large room for improvement when it comes to the convenience and promptness of the transportation.  If you're waiting at a bus stop for the 146, 147, and 151 for instance, you may see five 151 buses, and three 147 buses before you ever get the 146.  It can be very aggravating.  Also, it would be nicer if they had more train lines.  In most cases, you have to take 2 buses to get to your destination in terrible Chicago traffic.  Fact is, the train stops are scarce and in order to make transfers you have to go downtown to the Loop, which can be very inconvenient.  Also, you can wait on a station at the Loop that serves 4 different lines and never know when your train will get there.On the bright side, the bus drivers are very friendly for city employees.  I've been on buses in many major cities in the US and Latin American countries and Chicago has the friendliest drivers by far.",cta

This is ridiculous, but true.  We exited the Shedd Fri., July 16 when it closed at 6 p.m. and made our way to the bus stop.  The sign says the #130 runs until ""late afternoon.""  Why? It makes no sense not to serve the crowds until 6:30.  We were not alone in being stranded there, and the out-of-towners were not impressed with Chicago's hospitality!  We had to take the #146 bus, the only option, which took us north on State Street, then walk east to the station.  Of course, we missed the train we'd planned to take.

The renovated brown line stations are very nice and the closures are only mildly inconvenient (I now take a bus or 2 instead). The worst time is during peak hours, but during the off hours I have no problems. The bus drivers are nice, generally on time (within 5 minutes most days) and most are helpful. They have to deal with unruly customers, bad drivers on the road, and getting yelled at by the people who check to see if they are running on time. (I realize 'bus bunching' is bad but so is someone stopping you, yelling at you because your schedule is off, then having your customers get off and transfer to another bus so you can sit there and get back on schedule).

Yes they're having to still work out bugs in the system, but there's no reason for people complaining about CTA changing to a new fare payment system. Chicago is not the only city most of the major cities with actively used public transportation systems are upgrading to more current payment methods. I like how you can use your debit or credit card to put money on your VENTRA card. What I have a problem with is the fact that people are confused still as to what to do when they're putting money on the card and creating long lines. I am glad they changed the system it shows that CTA is keeping current with technology. People however were informed of this change more than two years ago and were given ample time to prepare for this and to know that stations were to begin removing the transit card machines. Another issue CTA has is overpacking the buses and trains because they keep packing train cars and buses after it's reached maximum capacity and it's not safe to have them like this. They also need to have posted notices informing those who travel with strollers to fold these things up so it frees up space for other passengers to sit down or stand comfortably, CTA also needs to rid the subways of the homeless and mentally ill  who take up residence there harassing customers waiting on the train.

Compared to New York's public transportation, Chicago's is definitely cleaner, and the announcements/general catering to the laymen public is much more prevalent. The system is more or less intuitive, although as a consumer of the MTA I am used to the ""swipe card"" system, and Chicago's ""input card"" system took me a second to figure out. Chalk it up to user error rather than an inherent flaw in the system itself. We are creatures of habit, after all.

Now I'm back to working in Philly and just recently, for the first time in my life, I used a Septa bus to get from Point A to Point B. Now don't get me wrong, I went up 11th St. to Reading Terminal and then turned around and went down 12th St. to get back to my office on a bus.  You would have thought I ran a freaking marathon, I was so proud of myself.My co-worker helped me and told me where to purchase the bus tokens and exactly which side of the street to stand on to catch the buses (I tell you, I was NERVOUS! What if I got on the wrong bus?  What if a bus never came? LOL).

The light rail wasn't working when I tried and a bus was running instead, but not on time. A train station closed me out before the last train of the day. The system was old, and the stations dirty. I wished I hadn't spent the money on day passes and instead had just gotten and airport ticket and walked. As a visitor who went multiple places that were very much on the train lines, they just weren't that helpful to me.Additionally, the card they have was quite strange and seemed set up as a quasi debit card, which is not what I'm looking for.

51,4,"Mar 25, 2022","I travel between on the SEPTA regional rail between Germantown and Center City. It's convenient, easy and efficient. The station I travel from/to most is Wayne Junction. It was renovated not too long ago and is reasonably clean and in good repair, if not exactly aesthetically uplifting. The trains I take (there are several to choose from when boarding at Wayne Junction) tend to be a few minutes off, but in my nearly six months of five-day-a-week commuting I've only been late to work once. (My Key Card is refilled automatically and I haven't yet figured out how much a one-way peak ticket costs, so I won't comment on the fare, but it is handy to have the automatic-refill feature and not to have to have cash on-hand.)  Sometimes the conductors are friendly and upbeat, often they appear indifferent/uncommunicative (but, with everyone wearing headphones or earbuds and/or glued to their smartphones I suppose one's impulse to be talkative and friendly might be dampened somewhat), and on occasion I've come across a SEPTA worker who is faintly hostile; I actually adjusted my schedule slightly several months ago to avoid having to interact with one such person. What else... Well, on the old trains (and they seem to outnumber the newer ones, at least on the routes I take) there is no information available other than what the conductor elects to impart, and often they elect to be silent. On the newer-model trains the information is displayed on monitors (alongside advertising) as well as announced in a computerized voice, which means you  are spared the regional dialect/disinclination to articulate, emanating from speakers that distort, but sometimes the details on the monitors/computerized voice announcement are not correctly synched and will announce, for example, that you're approaching a station that was actually a couple stops back. What's more, the information on the app, on the signs at the stations and on the exterior of the train tends to be inconsistent, which can be quite confusing for someone who's trying to figure out an unfamiliar route. It will go something like this: on the app it will say ""Airport,"" on the sign at the station it will say ""Newark,"" and on the exterior of the train it will say ""Center City."" So apparently the only way to be sure is to go by the train number. Here's a parting thought: Maybe, now that the pandemic seems to be, well, not so acute at the moment, the conductors could encourage people to use all the seats. As it is now, two people will sit in one of those three-seat rows, but often the two-seat rows will have only one person in them, and that person will place their backpack or purse or luggage on the empty seat. If people no longer are required to ""social-distance"" it might be a good idea to remind passengers to be courteous.",septa

The drivers are so ignorant and miserable. They have no information about routes or their job in general. They are so rude for people who deal with the general public. None of the routes are never on time or never show up at all. You're lucky if you get an older drive and ride that same route everyday they'll wait for you but other than that your SOL. They raise the fair every 2 years anywhere from 2-5 dollars. They implemented a fare card which also wasn't clearly thought through. You have to pay $5 for the card or load it with money. If you don't have enough on the card and use it they'll let you over draft it then you can't use it until you pay the overdraft. If you lose the card or it's stolen you have to pay an additional $5 to get a new one. You can only get a card from major septa stops such as 69th st city hall or Frankfort, if they even have any windows open to purchase one. The machines they have at other local stops are always out of order or malfunction and take your money without giving you the fair you purchase and they don't even care. When the pandemic occurred I had $200 on my fare card. They didn't even give me the money back. Told me I had to mail in a claim wait for septa to review the claim and then wait for them to send me a check in the mail just to get my money back. They consistently go on strike leaving the city in shambles because that's the only form of public transportation, even lord doesn't know how long the strike will be and they still won't refund you your money that is on your fare card so if you purchase a transpass while their on strike you wasted $25.50 yes 25.50 for a weekly pass gone to waste and no one cares.

I arrived at the train station, and it was completely vacant. Is there anyone I can talk to about how these magical trains run? They don't exist in Nashville.

He yelled out ""SORRY BUD, if you don't have cash or key you can't hop on board!"" And kept the train moving.               Back to my original statement: ""I have come to accept I will live my life disappointed with inefficiencies that the world offers""               How would this system improve, a ""scholar"" or ""expert"" may ask?              1) have a train station Venmo, cash app, zelle, Bitcoin, gofundme, onlyfans, whatever source available to give money.

This man and this business failed.               2) if idea 1 is too rational, have signs EVERYWHERE saying ""CASH ONLY"".               2a) if you are going with idea two (a worse idea, but better than no idea) , have on speakers ""CASH OR KEY CARD ONLY"" every minute and have an ATM and key card machine at every train station. Even if it's a robbery ATM (every ATM that wants $3 or more is a robbery ATM) it's better than no ATM.                3) have a square card that you can swipe with, if many Uber drivers can obtain the $49 square card how in the world can you not?                4) technology is the future, either ""hop on board, Venmo, cash, credit card and onlyfans accepted!"" or die a slow painful death.

The airport train (despite being using it) doesn't leave as frequently as I would have liked. Honestly even if you are a solo traveler, I think Uber would end up saving you time and a headache. Because I spent my first day using public transport only, I missed out doing something I had planned on going for the day.",septa

They can't make it through one entire contract length without the threat or an actual strike, leaving everyone stranded while their operators kick and scream to get what they think they're worth.

It's what you'd expect when you think of Philly.The biggest negatives are for a city the size of Philadelphia, two subway lines is substandard. Somewhere along the line, someone dropped the ball here. Compatible cities have twice as many lines. Over reliance on buses only creates more traffic on the city's narrow and old streets. Not to mention more than half the time, buses are not just a few minutes late, but in  many cases so late that it causes missed connections and frustration. Many times, I've been able to walk faster than the buses!The street car lines are a patchwork of forgotten dreams. Regional rail, in particular, the airport line runs only every 30 minutes and is nearly always full. PHL is a major hub that needs more frequent service.Connecting tunnels and stops in center city are a mess with few signs. Some transfers are free. Others are not with no other reason than someone didn't bother to build the appropriate tunnel.We needn't compare SEPTA to far superior systems in Europe or Japan. We only need to look at places like Portland, Oregon with 3, soon to be 4 light rail lines, a robust street car and bus system. In many cases, unlike Philly, these are green connected to either natural gas or electric lines. All of this, and Portland is half the size of Philadelphia!Improvements are being made, but nothing significant that will bring the service into the 21st century.

At Jefferson station, the agent said she could only give us a $1.50 discount per ticket off the full fare round trip price.

I was helped by the staff at the University City station gate on South Street, main station entrance and those working in the booth.

98,1,"Aug 20, 2018","Beware SEPTA's ""improved"" fare system!  SEPTA is in the process of rolling out bits and pieces of its ""new, better"" farecard system called The Key. If you're a regular commuter it's fine - you no longer have to carry tokens and change. But if you're a visitor or occasional rider, FUGEDDABOUDIT!  It's as if the so-called planners who put the Key system together managed to find everything they could to make its use inconvenient and expensive for anyone who isn't riding 9-5 on Monday to Friday.- If you don't have a Key card, you have to pay an extra 50¢ when boarding a bus or trolley. On the train system, you have to pay anywhere from $1.25 to $1.75 extra. On top of that, without a Key card you don't get a break if your trip requires transferring to a second vehicle - you have to pay a full fare for each transfer. So why not just get a Key card, you ask? Hey, this is SEPTA! Key cards are only available at certain locations, and there's a $4.95 fee to buy the card. Yeah, you get the $4.95 back as a fare credit if you go online and register your card but how many tourists will be returning to Philly in time to make use of the credit?  - It's at least possible to buy single-ride tickets (at the higher, surcharged rate, of course) from vending machines at maybe half of the subway stations. At the others, you need to have exact change to board. Yes there are ticket-booth attendants but they're NOT ALLOWED TO MAKE CHANGE!  Unless you've got the right bills and coins you have to round up to whatever denomination(s) you have in your wallet.  On the commuter train lines about 2/3 of the stations actually have ticket offices staffed by live humans, but the offices are only open limited hours. If the office is closed or non-existent you have to pay in cash on the train - again subject to that $1.25-$1.75 surcharge. - If that's not enough, those shiny new contactless e-pads installed in many stations and on vehicles? They only work with the Key card - credit card or mobile app payments aren't accepted. As a transit advocate it hurts deeply to say this, but if you're a visitor Uber's starting to look pretty good. SEPTA just _might_ be OK if you're only going to use it once in your life. Otherwise, it's simply not worth trying to navigate the rat's nest of fare limits, surcharges and just plain ""gotcha"" rules that the Key has brought on.",septa

They are ALWAYS late, about 10 times they didn't come at all, when they were supposed to. Later it would turn out that a bus broke in its way or a driver would be new and didn't know where to go. But how are people supposed to know that?? Standing at a bus stop in the rain or snow, how are they supposed to know when even Septa's app doesn't work properly and nothing tells you why a bus is being late or  not coming at all . And how about people who don't have smartphones or have no idea how to use an app? People at customer service are not necessarily helpful every time. What surprises me the most is why not to make busses come every half an hour or at least every hour? Why does the life of those who don't drive has to depend on a bus schedule?

20,1,"Sep 4, 2023","Pretty bad it is no lower option. I am taking the train for years. The other day at North Station I wanted to buy a ticket for train one way. If you do not know North Station than you should know that this station is very involved with tracking people who do not pay- but not with the quality of the service, they provide to customers. Therefore no one can go in the waiting area without a ticket - good thing I believe - and no one can get out from the arriving trains area without scanning the ticket- not a good think. People wait in line in the morning to scan the tickets- scanners do not work well so we all are trap there waiting in long lines. No one care about our time and safety I might say. And all for catching few evaders at the expense of all the rest of us. Does not matter that trains are late, signals problems all the time even thou for years federal money were drawn for so call improvements. Trains are late all the time, and no one cares.But the other day something new happened. No employee was at the 30 or so gates to help customers and be able to buy a ticket. So I went to buy a ticket -one way- at the booth.  Each of the two booths open had a person they already were in a process to finish their transaction, but no one was waiting. So, I start waiting a few feet away from one both- the person at the booth seems that was almost done. Which she was. She left and when I got at the booth the employee refused to sell me ticket under the pretext that I did not wait in line. In the meantime, while I was waiting another person came and now, he was waiting too to buy ticket. I explain her that when I arrived no one was waiting so that person came after me. She did not ask the person if he found me there, but she continue to refuse to sell me a ticket. I did tell her I will lose the train which- thanks to MBTA is only one every hour- and she continue to refuse to sell the ticket and send me back inline which by now there were 3-4 people. Finally, she got my 20$ and give me a ticket. When I checked the ticket, she gave a ticket for a longer trip with the train then I told her I need: actually, the maximum she could charge for that train even if repeatedly I told her I want a ticket for zone 6.When I mention that the change and ticket are not correct and I am not traveling to the end of the line she told me to get them back to her. Which I did and hope she will give me the correct ticket. NO!. She gave me the 20$ back and sent me back in line again. Even If I told her my train will leave in less than 5 minutes, she refused to sell me a ticket. I finally left hoping that I will find an employee at the gate who will sell me a ticket and will not have to wait another 1h for next train. I did find someone which sold me a ticket and I was able to get in time to the train. From train, I did call customer service and complain about this vicious and unprofessional attitude . They told me they will investigate. I guess they still do since 2 weeks pass from even  and had not heard back from them. However, 2 days after event, I saw a supervisor and I asked him about this incident. He knew and he told me they are investigating. They will look at the camera footage. I hope they do. Apparently, this employee told them that I left the booth and come back - which it is not true - lying to justify her appalling behavior.",mbta
21,1,"Sep 19, 2022","After three years, the and an Orange Line month long shut down, I can tell you the train is the worst it has ever been. The trains have been updated, with most of them (if not all) being of the newer model. The problem, however is that the MBTA remains consistent in it's overwhelming mission to make public transportation the worst option for anyone to take.I got on the Roxbury Crossing train at 4:40 PM today and thought I could make it to Malden Center by 5:15 PM, and I could not have been more wrong. It was cutting close, I knew the risks, but I was hopeful the month long shutdown would bring some much needed improvements. After all, it's not like the orange line routinely shut down for sections at a time on weekends over the last decade... anyways - we reached North Station at 5:05 and I was still hopeful I could make my time. By 5:25 we still hadn't made it to Assembly. This is 2 stops after North Station, just to put it into perspective. We may legitimately be moving at 10 mph at most currently. Why waste the time writing a review? Well my friends, I'm actually still on the train right now. It's about 5:40 PM and we still have not arrived at Malden Center. I could have finished all the Lord of the Rings movies by now.Cheers, folks! To another decade of mediocrity from the MBTA.",mbta
22,1,"Apr 3, 2019","The MBTA's singular job is to disappoint you on a daily basis. They routinely excel at wasting your time and making you late. They are consistent, I will surely give them that. There has never been a service that shows as much of a disregard for their customers, and it is because they know that 95% of us depend on them and have no other viable option. We were told to get off the train at Wellington and to take a shuttle bus to oak grove. After waiting for ten minutes with no shuttle, we are told that the train is now coming and to get back on. 15 minutes later, the train to oak grove arrives. So we sit on the train and wait, and wait, and wait... and 30 minutes later we finally start to move.In summary, the MBTA is the greatest at being the worst. Knowing that their customers have no other choice, they exploit that fact to provide the worst possible service while still increasing their fares at a regular rate. If I could avoid taking the train ever again, I would be forever grateful. Unfortunately, I must face this nightmarish crapshoot of a service almost every single day.",mbta

26,1,"Jul 17, 2023",This is an extremely poorly run and fairly incompetent transportation system. They advertise all summer long to switch from car commute to train/subway/bus in order to allow construction on major tunnels in Boston and avoid traffic and yet have major delays on subway lines causing you to miss trains. I've only been commuting via MBTA for three weeks and have already missed two trains due to two separate subway delays (I got on the subway a good 40 minutes before my train left north station and still missed it) and have also had one train cancelled shortly before boarding and another train delayed shortly before boarding. I would rather rot in traffic than take this commuter service and will not be renewing my monthly pass. I shouldn't have to pay almost 400 a month to then pay for an Uber to get me to the north station to catch my train on time because the subway can't stick to a schedule. As I'm writing this my commuter train is sitting at the station 20 minutes late for departure and we've just been asked to deboard and board on another track. The MBTA oozes incompetence.,mbta

36,4,"Nov 11, 2019","Seeing all the negative reviews, the first thing I am thinking is, why?Sure, the trains are packed, but that is a good thing! That means people are using this system to the fullest, and I mean the fullest!The Boston T (which I predominantly rode everywhere while in Boston) is the oldest subway system in the United States (even older than the New York City subway). It has three subway lines, the Red Line, the Blue Line, and the Orange Line, and one extensive light rail line, the Green Line (which acts like a subway downtown). There is also a commuter rail and a rapid bus service (the Silver Line), but I will be focusing on the T in this review.The T is a first-generation subway, which for those that are unfamiliar, is a subway system that was built before the advancement of the automobile and the interstate highway system. This falls in line with three other subway networks in the United States; the aforementioned New York City Subway, the Chicago ""El"", and the SEPTA Subway. Each of these systems were built with extensive station stops to accommodate large groups inasmuch as there was not a way to do so before the 1940's and 1950's. That is why the train infrastructure is older, the trains more frequent, and stops are closer together. But it also explains why it is better than something say like, Atlanta's MARTA, or Washington, DC's Metro. Those two systems are second-generation subways, or systems built to supplement the automobile, rather than act like one. But back to the T.I really liked the fact that they offer several passes to make it easy to travel without spending a lot of money. The maps are easy to understand, and connections are easy and fluid. If I had to nitpick on one thing I did not like, it was that the turnstiles are often broken, and that presented problems while trying to get into some of the stations. At least there were employees willing to assist at most of the stations where possible.If you come to Boston, definitely do not plan on taking a car everywhere. Traffic stinks, parking is worse. Use the T.",mbta
37,4,"Oct 20, 2021","There is a real chasm in the reviews here for MBTA - Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority.  If you look at the source(s) of this, decent reviews seem to be written by out-of-towners and marginal reviews seem to come from the locals.MBTA means you don't need to have a car in Boston.  That seems to hold true for the locals as well as those visiting.  MBTA is often referred to as the ""T,"" especially if referring to its rail routes.  The routing is fairly logical and there are four rail lines:  three of them are heavy rail, meaning they use subway type cars, and one is a trolley type line.  Understanding the lay of the land with respect to the three subway lines is doable while the more trolley-like Green Line can be perplexing.  It fans out from downtown to go to 4 different terminuses, so you will have to pay attention to the train's signage.  (One of the terminuses is Chestnut Hill, which means Boston College.)  The Green Line is obviously also the oldest line in the system.  Once you're done with college - at least undergraduate studies - college kids can be annoying ... and Boston has a lot of colleges!  The good thing is that they are mostly in different places and rail seems to reach many of them - B.U., Boston College, Suffolk, UMass Boston down south, and Harvard and MIT in Cambridge, among others.  Harvard (Square), on the Red Line, is an interesting station where there are always performers and, well, characters.Visually, the system map is somewhat easy to grasp, while that of Washington DC is not so easy to grasp and that of New York City is a hopeless case. Unlike with many other urban transit systems, the rail cars are painted in the color of the line.  That means you'll have blue, red, and orange subway cars and green light rail cars.   Another interesting thing is that, on the subway cars, the seating faces inward, with seats only along the windows, while on the Green Line, the seats are lined up in rows, like one typically sees.All the lines come into downtown Boston.  At several stations, such as Downtown Crossing, Government Center, and State, various lines come through them and seem to be stacked on different levels.  It's as compact as Boston itself and feels very different from, say, MARTA or BART, where suburban stations have big parking lots.MBTA runs the trains, buses, and some ferries.  Commuter trains to further out suburbs use a much different pricing structure and are more expensive.  I've ridden on a few of the buses.  I wouldn't say that the bus drivers were rude, like some people are claiming.  A better word might be crusty.  Crusty doesn't bother me, but rude does.  Of the ferries, the ones a tourist is more likely to use are the ones from downtown to Charlestown, which is how you might return after walking the Freedom Trail instead of doubling back on it, as well as the one from downtown to Boston Logan Airport (BOS).  Also, MBTA runs free normal sized shuttle buses around waterside BOS Airport so you can connect to the water shuttle or to the subway.  BOS actually has an MBTA station called - you guessed it - Airport, on the Blue Line, which is next to the airport instead of in it.  This is commendable because, at Washington-Dulles Airport, rail will be arriving there soon, after about 40 years, and, in NYC, there is no subway to La Guardia Airport and the inexpensive ""milk train"" A train that went all around Brooklyn to Howard Beach in Queens, from which you could take a free shuttle to JFK, is gone and you now use pricey AirTrain to get to JFK via public transit.  So, Boston has the airport smartly connected to the the city center and many key places.For this being Boston, MBTA's fare structure is acceptable.  A single ticket on rail is $ 2.40.  There are also things called Charlie cards (which probably sounds great when said with a New England accent).  The daily card isn't a bargain, but it's easier to go that route than buy individual tickets.  The weekly card, on the other hand, is nicely priced.  It appears that the day or multi-day Charlie cards are not usable on the ferries.  I was told that they were, and then found out otherwise.  Nevertheless, you will want to ride on at least one ferry because the skyline and harbor views are captivating.The MBTA system is a workhorse and it does a lot.  It isn't ridiculously priced and it's convenient, so that's why people pack into it.  But at some times during the day, it has empty seats and it's almost relaxing to ride the subway.  MBTA stands for four words, and I think that, independent of isolated skirmishes, some eccentricities, and an oddity like a pandemic, MBTA is worthy of four stars.",mbta

Being a northern city, Boston ought to prepare for inclement weather like any other major city, yet it does not. Every winter you can count on multiple trains being out of service every day, causing delays ""up to 15 minutes"" which actually means at minimum 1 hour and probably longer.Today their most modern line, the Blue line, had a signal failure which caused significant delays. They had 1 person on the platform providing no information, did not arrange for shuttle busses to deal with the thousands of commuters they inconvenienced, and knowing their service was down neglected to inform people of this until after they had swiped their card and paid for the ride.Any other business that was run as poorly as the MBTA would have been run out of town on a rail decades ago, but here we are.A major city should have:Multiple T lines which reach most major neighborhoods outside the center of the city.Transit systems which run on time within +-5 minutes of scheduleTransit system that can handle the expected 80-100 inches of snow each year Boston receivesTransit systems which are professionally managed so commuters are kept up to date about delays and screw ups.Boston's MBTA can claim none of these. Its a failed agency and should be auctioned off to a more professional organization, and any who have had a say in its management over the last 2 decanes should be immediately fired and prevented from ever being employed in the public transportation sector in the future.Sincerely,A T'ed off Bostonian",mbta

The white asked me questions and the latino asked this black man. I did not know what the black man answers the questions. The white man simply asked me what was going on and he even said I should not go to the court because it would hard to explain because he said I should fight back even though I did for God's sake.

89,3,"Aug 14, 2015","MBTA reminded me of Toronto (TTC) in some ways. The frequencies, in theory, are good for a city of its size, but its execution is quite poor. From a tourist point of view, it does its job in terms of providing information for a tourist to navigate the system, however there were definitely flaws I found in the network.The most noticeable issue was the signaling system. I rode the Red Line into Boston during rush hour, but we were literally inching between Harvard and Park Street to the point it took 20 minutes just for that section. There was also quite a noticeable gap ahead of us (I waited 4 mins for my train at Harvard), so I wasn't sure what the holdup was. The Orange Line, on the other hand, suffered from quite a bit of bunching, with 14 min waits during the height of rush hour, then trains coming in 1-2 min successions.Then there was the Green Line...an excellent idea for a LRT (it's even displayed on the T map for gods sake), but it's way over capacity. Getting on the Green Line at Park Street was like trying to squeeze in a Yamamote train in Shinjuku.I only tried the Washington Street portion of the Silver Line, and similarly there was quite a lot of bunching, with 15-20 min gaps then 3 buses coming at once. I will say though, it's a great idea for the Silver Line to be displayed on the T map, even though it's barely a passable BRT system.Some of the stations were set up quite well, such as the Park Street Red Line platform (Spanish solution), Harvard (wide platforms), and North Station (Orange and Green Lines on the same platform). The ticket machines are quite easy to understand, but don't forget to purchase a free CharlieCard if you want to save money!Overall the MBTA reminds me of the TTC back home.

91,1,"Oct 19, 2016","I felt very humiliated by a MTBA worker at the Boylston Station today. I was carrying heavy groceries in both hands, tapped my MONTHLY PASS at the entrance, heard the beep but the door did not open. I tapped again but got the ""card already used"" message because MBTA prevents people from sharing the same card. I remembered I was told to or read somewhere that just walk behind someone if this happened(yes, I know I could be totally wrong here). So I followed the next person and got in. This MTBA worker emerged from the a booth looking furious. He immediately start yelling at me for sneaking in without paying. I told him I tapped my card but the door didn't open. He kept saying something in line with ""did you just walk in behind someone?"" I told him again that I tapped the card but door didn't open, and it didn't even matter because I had a monthly pass anyway. However, he continued to act really pissed off and made me walk out of the entrance (I was carrying a lot of groceries on both hands), and threatened to write me a ticket if I was lying. So I had to walk out, but for some unknown reason he pulled out his cellphone and started to make a phone call meanwhile I was standing outside of the gate looking at him. I kept tapping my pass at the door multiple times desperately trying to show him that I had a monthly pass. He looked at me but was still on his phone call (maybe he was calling the police to arrest me). Eventually, he got off the call and opened the gate but still blamed me for not waving at him first. In my defense, first, usually there is no one sitting in the booth at this hour of day. And second, his booth was dim. It was impossible to tell if someone was in there. It seems that he was quick to spot me ""sneaking in"" but too slow to know that I was tapped my card couple of times and the door never opened.Even if it was all my fault for walking in behind someone and even if this was all just a misunderstanding, he didn't have to act so dramatically like a bully and ignored me while I wait outside of the entrance to get in.I felt extremely humiliated and emotional as if I was falsely caught stealing. All the other passengers at Boylston looked me probably thinking I was being caught trying skipping a $2.50 fare. In an ideal world, he should be apologizing to me because MBTA's gates malfunctioned and caused inconvenience for me. Next time when the MBTA door doesn't open, I know I have only these options. 1. Wave at the booth and try to get a MBTA worker's attention even if he was focusing on his cell phone screen, praying he actually raises his head. 2. If there is no one sitting in the booth at the moment or the MBTA worker was too devoted to his/her cellphone, then consider your fare wasted. Go buy another ticket. 3. In my case, since I have a monthly pass, I will have to wait for another 20 mins (10mins? I don't know exactly how long it takes) so my pass can be tapped again. Pray that the gate opens for you this time. Update: although I appreciate the upvotes, I don't find this incident funny( well, maybe a little bit). I'm still mad thinking about it now. Every time I walked into Boylston and saw that booth, this incident came back to me. It's like having PTSD!

After riding on metro systems from major cities around the world, I was quite shocked in regard of the metro system they got in Boston being a major city in the most developed country of the world.I was skeptical after riding on the blue, orange, and red line, but the horror came after trying the green line.  I felt like I just time traveled back to the early 1900s.  Perhaps they kept it that way for historical reason to demonstrate one of the oldest cities in the US.The most frustration part was faulty fare gates, it popped up a message saying see staff for help, but there was not a single staff personnel in the entire station.  Then we saw a few students just walk right past a gate under maintenance without tickets, and another couple used a 1-for-2 method.

I took the Red line from South Station to Park Street and then I took the trolley to Kenmore. Kenmore station is roughly a 10 minute walk to Fenway. The MBTA is one of the cleanest systems that I've ever used. Most of the stations and train cars were spotless. There were a few homeless people (I don't judge other people), but they weren't aggressive like the panhandlers in the NYC subway. The trains have a tendency to bunch up. The wait times can range from 2 to 12 minutes. The trains move pretty fast. It took only 20 minutes to travel from downtown Boston to Fenway. The cars on the Red line were comfortable. The trolley, however, uses an older car model that is somewhat decrepit. Still, it got me from point A to point B.Almost every part of Boston is served by the MBTA. It goes to Fenway, Logan Airport, and two of the best universities in the world. There's even a commuter rail line that travels from South Station to Gillette Stadium. If your car tires are ""deflated"" then you can take the train to the Patriots game instead. The fare is reasonable- a one way ride is $2.75 and an all day pass is $12. The only caveat is that the MBTA shuts down between ~1 AM and 5 AM, so if you're clubbing on a Saturday night or if a Yankees vs Red Sox game goes to the 15th inning then you have to take that into consideration.",mbta
99,1,"Apr 13, 2016","Ahh the T! My old, dirty, tired, broken down, transportation buddy! Here are some of the lovely issues with the T:1. Service issues plague the subways- the Blue Line I have never had an issue with, and very few with the Red. Orange line is a nightmare and always breaking, so is the Green Line, but that's because it runs on old trolley lines.2. The commuter rail. I ride this daily. Among the issues are switching problems, Amtrak delays, breakdowns, and cold weather. Those super duper new locomotives hate the cold apparently. Kind of like my Ford. I ride out of North Station on the Haverhill line, which is one of the lines most on time- however, I grew up in West Concord on the Fitchburg line and that line sucks. It's constantly 15 minutes or more late. Go figure.3. Cleanliness... are the trains ever cleaned? I mean more than once a year or once every 10? They're filthy. The blue line is clean cause no one freaking rides it. Orange is super sketch and grimy (and overcrowded), Red is sorta ok, but smells a bit, Green is dirty and overcrowded. The Commuter Rail? Filthy, old, and always dirty. Do they ever wash the exterior of the cars? They look vile, and with a 40+ year old locomotive pulling the train- it's laughable at best.4. Staff. Don't get me started on the pay scale- most are unfriendly and unhelpful. Commuter rail conductors are touch and go, some are better than others- the few engineers I've spoken to are pretty cool. But the customer service department? Don't make me laugh so hard!There are more, but that's the T and people who ride it daily know the issues plaguing the transit system in this city.

100,1,"Jan 31, 2011","I'm all for public transportation, and the Boston T set-up isn't that bad. I commuted to school using the Orange line for two semesters and it's usually very reliable and convenient. When the T is reliable, I don't have many complaints. I do wish there were some sort of connections between the separate Green lines (besides buses), and that it ran later than 12:30am, but that's besides the point. I'm here to talk about the commuter rail.I don't have to use the commuter rail every day (thank God), so it could be more reliable than I've experienced. Maybe I just have bad luck? Or bad karma? I dunno. I like to think of myself as a nice, compassionate person (though I do have a bit of a short temper). But still, I'm not quite sure what I've done to deserve such horrible luck with the commuter rail.Even in the fairest of weather conditions, the arrival time has always been at least 5-10 minutes later than it's scheduled to be, no matter which line I'm traveling on. Not a huge travesty, but still annoying when I have plans that require further transportation. They should really update the schedules so they're more accurate. All that aside, it's my most recent excursion that has driven me to ""create a business"" for the MBTA as a whole.I just returned home from what should have been a simple 1 hour and 10 minute trip from Providence to Boston, but I assure you 'twas not so simple. The 5:10 train made it into South Station at 9:04. And I kid you not. Check the records (if that's even possible?).Apparently something went wrong with the engine, so they spent ~75 minutes troubleshooting at South Attleboro to no avail. They then sent the next train to switch tracks and back up to our broken-down train so they could hitch the two together and tow us to Boston. Why this took another ~55 minutes to complete is beyond me. And why they made us wait outside in 12 degree weather while all this went down is even more baffling.The overall lack of updates, compassion, and hustle from the conductors is what REALLY ticked me off. When I asked for a refund, the guy smirked and told me to go to www.mbta.com ""like everyone else."" I wanted to punch him. I hope us poor passengers of train 822 will be receiving a hefty sum for our troubles, but I doubt it. I also hope that it won't be a credit for MBTA commuter rail tickets.

Cal. where there was no such thing as decent public transportation until recently; maybe it's because I like trains and trams and other vehicles that move a lot of people; maybe it's because I could park and ride the subway for less money and a hell of a lot less stress than driving; but I am now a huge fan of the MBTA.The two days we toured Boston we used the subway to get into the city.  We found parking for $5 per day at the end of the Blue Line.  The trip into downtown Boston takes about 30 minutes.  The cars are clean and it is pretty easy to figure out where you are and when you need to get off.The only confusion we really had was at the Government Center hub trying to figure out the Green Line.  Once we finally figured out which train we needed, it was a piece of cake to get to the Science Museum.The MBTA also appealed to my bargain side.  My wife and I purchased 7 day passes for $18 each.  While we did not need the full 7 days, and we paid $5 a day for parking, we still saved because parking in the city is outrageously expensive.  Also, I saved myself a ton of stress because driving in Boston really is pretty intense.This is a very good public transportation system.  I was happy to see that it appears to have very good ridership.  There was only one really freaky wierdo that I saw during our two days using the MBTA so it seems they keep it policed pretty well.Highly recommended public transportation if you need to get around Boston.",mbta

This agent was completely useless other than the fact he insisted upon escalating the situation every chance he got. I HIGHLY recommend retraining. Every time I went to speak he would cut me off to the point that I had to state for him to stop cutting me off when I am speaking. He refused to let me speak to a manager, first stating there were none (extremely surprising to me with numerous years of  working in and managing a call center team), then stated they were busy, then stated they were there but still refused to let me speak with them. He seems unaware of basic processes and proper customer support handling. He informed me that it is not his problem nor the MBTA's issue that I was charged $281 for a monthly pass, and did not receive that pass. Also not their problem to work with my bank who i conferenced in to provide an authorization code to cancel said pending transaction. Stated that they do not have any control over said mTicket app and no one else does. He replied to the bank representative that the only way to get in contact with someone that does in fact have that power was by mail. I find it absolutely mind blowing and quite frankly a lie that you have no power over your app as you are the merchant. The representative's name was Naris. Thanks to him and by extension you I missed a day of work in office. Not to mention he stated to me in a very condescending tone ""I appreciate your determination but there's is absolutely nothing we can do"".

I was able to go as far as Samuel Adams Brewery and far down Back Bay and felt comfortable taking the MBTA. The only time it let me down was when I was further down the Back Bay and waiting for a bus, I was not able to find a bus and ended up having to take a taxi. It is convenient, but does not operate past 12:30am in most stations so that's not convenient if you want to go out to a bar to hang out until late. I would still recommend it as a method of transportation if you are visiting Boston as it is far more convenient than driving or taxi.",mbta
109,1,"Aug 8, 2015","YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING.....For a major metropolitan city, Boston's T subway is more nostalgia that efficiency.Haven ridden San Francisco's BART, Paris's RAR, Washington D.C.'s Metro - the T SUBWAY is a JOKE.The ticket machines are hard to understand and negotiate. The home screen shows purchase values of $5, $10 and other. A round trip pass costs $5.30, but in order to pay $5.30, you must select ""other"" and enter the purchase value.Plus you cannot buy more than one pass per transaction. For a family of four, that means four separate transactions and credit card swipes.The cars are old and in disrepair.The system is not intuitive.Once underground, the signage is not clear as to the direction one must go or the next stop.In this day and age of technology and automation, the T Subway is lacking in both.The subways stations are run down and dilapidated.The few that we visited smelled of vomit, urine and homeless people.Walking through town, we walked under some of the elevated tracks. Many have substantial rust and corrosion. It is amazing that they are still standing.Got to love the ""make work"" for union operators... many rear subway cars, that are connected to a lead car - have an operator sitting at the controls. They cannot even see where they are going. They MUST be union workers....I even watched a MBTA worker allowing people to enter via the exit turnstiles.Only redeeming value - the low price reflects it's technology and efficiency.Visited July 2015",mbta

I wish Chicago would get on the stick add digital signs inside all of the L cars - not just the few new ones - announcing the upcoming stop and train direction. I've seen way too many tourists freak out when their stop comes up or ask you every block if they're there yet.The T got me pretty close to every place I needed to go so I can't really complain, but I will; however, my two complaints are very minor. First, it would be nice if there was a 3-day Charlie ticket - lots of people take weekend trips and it would be nice to have an option besides 1 or 7 day passes. Second, it may be temporary, but the Fenway Park stop is downright confusing. I knew it was too good to be true when I walked up to the platform without passing any fare gates. Apparently I was supposed to know I should hold my ticket up as I boarded or get on by the conductor. The conductor called out anyone she suspected of not paying (including me). The whole method seems very suspect, I didn't pay out of confusion, but the girls next to me who flashed their cards were still called out for not paying. We all ended up having to go to the front of the train to swipe our cards. I pity the fool that hates on the T; it's not perfect, but I've yet to meet a transit system that is.",mbta

THE PITS!!!I'm on the Wickford Junction/Providence line which basically means we never arrive on time, the train is packed to the point of asphyxiation for most passengers and the conductors only collect until they decide they are tired. Your best bet is to get on in Sharon because usually from that point on, your ticket won't be clicked or collected (free ride!). Every, single day is a new adventure on the MBTA because you never quite know what the delay reason is. A switch problem? Mechanical issues? The tracks are too hot? They are short a conductor (heck, one time we didn't have an engineer!)? It's anyone's guess, but you're guaranteed to not get where you are going on-time. It would be great to say that this past bad winter was the only reason, but the trains run just as inefficiently when it's spring, 70 degrees and clear, blue skies. The train is dirty, the bathrooms are disgusting and many of the seats are torn, caving in or falling apart in general. Try not to touch anything, and definitely don't put your bags on the floor (no matter what they tell you). If you're lucky, you'll get to ride this train line and have an interaction with the infamous Gidget Gaines, aka the train conductor from hell. If she isn't slamming the train door in your face as you are just about to board (""People wait for trains, trains don't wait for people""), then she's either sneering at you as she collects tickets or staring you down with her ominous (and unforgettable) brow. Watch your step, people, she WILL mow you down. And in her famous words, ""Have your monies"" ready when she comes through because, you know, apparently MBTA accepts all forms of currency? Heaven forbid you're not ready, you won't make that mistake with her again. On the flip side, you aren't a true commuter until you've had a run-in with the rude and legendary Gidget. Unless you're her friend - then you get a free ride (or even use of her pass!). The prices just keep going up and the service keeps going down, down, down. Soon it will make more sense to just pay the few extra bucks to take the Amtrak into Boston. To sum it up:1) There is no such thing as on-time on the MBTA. There is DEFINTELY no such thing as an ""express"" train. Don't bother rushing to make that special train that makes less stops - it's a sham.2) It's crowded. Really crowded. You will get coughed on, stepped on, sneezed on, elbowed and will be made to suck it up as the conductors cram people onto the train so that you literally. cannot. move. Talk about fire hazards.3) While a handful of the conductors are nice and friendly, there are a fair share of rude and unfriendly types who will make this unpleasant experience even worse.4) The cost to ride this abomination of public transportation is ludicrous.

The subway cars, like the city are tiny and compact.  They remind me of San Francisco rail cars that zip along the city, except underground.  When its rush hour, I can imagine each individual car being tight with people, which was the case and I was using it mainly at night.The system lines themselves are differentiated by colors, no numbers or alphanumeric combinations of any sort.  This in itself made the maps very clear and easy to understand.  Another plus to the individual stations is that they were all mostly well lit and had fans blasting during the hot summer time which is something NYC could most definitely use.  Like the MTA in NYC however, I have seen piles of vomit, piss, and trash in some areas which are putrid in odor and disappointing overall.

I found this system to be much better than the NYC subway and very similar to the San Francisco Bay Area BART system. Its been way to long since I took any other local train system to recall with any certainty how it would compare to that as well.Overall the cars were decently cleaned, I wish they had had more seating though. The seats almost entirely lined the edges leaving standing room in the middle. I think it would have been a bit nicer had there been rows of seats like a bus or regular train. It was set up so that people can bring their bikes with them, except for during ""rush hour."" Pro Tip: This option is much cheaper for folks trying to go into Boston from the burbs and or from the airport if they are staying in Boston proper and don't want to rent a car.Overall the MBTA system is set up nicely and extends all over the major metropolitan area. It was definitely nice to have most of it subterranean in the city itself. The outdoor stations with open air platforms during the winter storms may really suck though. Hopefully I wouldn't have to wait for a train on one of those platforms in the midst of a blizzard. Pro Tip #2: Love that the munchkins can ride for free... Mine definitely enjoyed the ride and I loved that it was free for her.I also liked that the system was set up to easily swap trains and for a very cheap price overall. Using the Charlie card with a preset rate regardless of distance is a bit different but worked fine for me. This certainly made it easier than trying to calculate total costs and putting that much on a card. Generally I did enjoy taking multiple trips on this system and was pleased with its efficiency and frequency. I suggest that you give it a go to, regardless of if you are a local or a tourist.",mbta

Part of me really likes them, part of me realizes how unconvenient that they can be, and part of me thinks that the price (subsideized and otherwise) are not worth it. I think that the parking situation for some of the stops on this route were beyond atrocious... Seriously the Malden station had a pay lot with at most 100 spaces whereas the Wellington Station had what could have been 750 or 1000! The station locations are somewhat sensical, however, if they had really wanted to increase ridership and lessen traffic, wouldnt they have bigger lots and built them to cruise alongside of the freeways?Pro Tip: You purchase a round trip with each use at $2.50 ea direction. This is by far cheaper than parking in Boston itself.Overall though its a pretty good system. It is about a million times cleaner than the NY Subway, its not half as unsightly as the Chicago El, runs with the efficiency of SF Bay Areas BART and it is much more userfriendly than the London Underground. So it is a plus in my opinion. Pro Tip #2: Children under 12 are able to ride for free! Very nice perk!Many of the elevators and escalators seemed to be under repair. I also noticed that they would randomly send cars to a siding or reroute them on the orange green and blue lines for no reason and out of nowhere. I have never understood that kinda thing, but what are ya gonna do other than take and move on?Overall it wasnt a bad thing and helped on my trip there.

The price for a monthly pass is reasonable ($70), which includes both bus and subway service. Every single thing in Boston is less than a half mile from a MBTA station.  Sometimes the distances between stops are ridiculously small; for example on the B line, there are stops on every intersection. I am from Florida; where the trains come every two hours and they are about ten miles apart.  People who cannot afford cars really suffer because they waste so much of their day on transportation, or they end up housebound.

In that case, pay cash fare ($2.50) and then buy a pass at another stop, or 7-11. $11 Daily Pass/$18 Weekly/$70 Monthly. --Watch how other people use their ticket first. If you put the ticket in, and you don't go in when the gate opens, your ticket won't work for another 20 minutes!!  Also, if you entered at the wrong entrance (inbound vs. outbound), don't go back outside to the other entrance, or you will get the timeout. Try to see if there's an internal staircase to switch direction.--If not, it might be better to walk then to wait for the timeout to end. Remember Boston is really small. The walking distances between the stops on the Green Line are about 5 minutes, and on the Red and Orange, about 10 minutes. Even stops on two different lines can be very close. Ex. Copley (Green) and Back Bay (Orange) look far on the map, but they are two blocks apart.-You can go between Green Line E Prudential and Orange Line Back Bay stops internally by walking through the mall. --Use apps like Moovit to get real-time info about your train or bus.--The MBTA monthly commuter passes (from Boston to other cities) INCLUDE local service, so do not buy both commuter passes and local passes.--Many employers in Boston offer free MBTA passes to their workers. So if you want to reward me for my awesome review, please consider selling me one =) Also, you can message me with any questions.",mbta

157,3,"Mar 20, 2014","I'm a part time writer. I get some of my best material from the MBTA. When I get bored with my characters, stymied with my plot lines and feel that my descriptions are stale and cliched, I can just hop onto the MBTA with my Charlie Card. (Keep in mind that I usually am headed somewhere, but the thought of random rides has occurred to me.) From the man spewing darkly fascinating Kennedy assassination theories out loud to all who care (Caroline and Teddy were responsible) to the blissfully lost tourists with their delightful enthusiasm, I have gathered all kinds of ideas for characterization. I've seen every imaginable form of body waste, every kind of poverty plea and every body type that exists. (Along with some body parts that should not be seen in public.) I've seen rude drivers, sweet drivers, near misses on the B Line, large rats, fare jumpers (very common), way too many drunks, a snake, a bird and six baby mice in a pink plastic cage. I've seen fist fights. With blood. When I am in a hurry, it's late. When I am not in a hurry, it's on time. The Green Line's brake situation must have contributed to the mild hearing loss in my right ear, which my Primary Care Provider informed me of in a raised voice last year. That's the line I use most of the time. The screeching sounds coming from the Green Line can be heard for close to 1/3 of a mile away. This is true. The prices go up, the stations shut down, the escalators get stuck, the stations are dirty, but I really have a strong affection for the MBTA. I'm glad they are staying open later for the college students, I'm glad they are fixing the Government Center Station, and I am very glad they are extending the Green Line. Thanks for all of the good times, MBTA.",mbta

159,3,"Jan 29, 2009","Daniel Grabauskas, General Manager of the MBTA...let's go for a homo to homo stroll. But I'll do the talking - you're a gay republican and shouldn't speak.I think it's really cool that you're in charge of the oldest subway system in the country. And I really like some of things you've implemented like the convenient Charlie Card and those announcements of when trains are approaching. *Runs and pushes old ladies to make the train*But there are definitely some things you need to work on. For example, I realize we're running on a one track system so disabled trains will definitely cause delays. But howcome there are also delays when trains aren't broken down? Come stand with me outside on a January morning in Boston and experience what your passengers do. It's rush hour yet the trains may take forever to come. And when they do, there's no room to get on. No worries, we can stand and wait for 3 more trains to come before I freeze to death...no prob right? And what's the deal with those advertisements from overpaid athletes telling me to take the T? You should study marketing because when I'm standing on the platform, I'm obviously already a customer...and we all know that these Pats and Bruins players don't take the T themselves.And last but certainly not least, I have a big problem with the fact the T shuts down at 1AM. Don't you think it would be wise and SAFE to have public transit available until at least 2:30AM on Friday and Saturday? Or would you rather people drive home drunk or hop in a cab that is equivalent to driving with someone intoxicated? Just sayin'Thanks for the chat. I hope you were listening.P.S. - As for the buses...do they really need to have stops on almost every corner? What are peoplez legz broke!? OBESITY EPIDEMIC IN AMURRIKA!",mbta
160,1,"Apr 2, 2008","One million NEGATIVE stars. Seriously unacceptable. Dear MBTA, I often shrug off my mishaps with the T because for the most part it's tolerable.. but what happened yesterday is completely unacceptable. I have a employee credit card for travel. If the person reading this doesn't know what that is.. it's a credit card supplied by my employer that deducts money from my paycheck monthly so that I can use it when purchasing a pass for my Charlie Card. Point is, I get it taken out of my paycheck before taxes which saves money. Yesterday, I tried to use my employee credit card, only to get two screens that said ""Transaction Canceled"". The Boston Globe salesman had to tell me the machine was broken. ""It's been broken all morning."" So, not only did it not work for me, people before me and after me were going to have issues. He pointed to an open gate and said that everyone was just going through there and to try buying a pass at another station. This has been happening for months, so I just shrugged it off. Does the T realize how much it's throwing away on the first of the month when people are strolling through those gates? After work, I went to the Boylston station to buy a pass and was once again denied. I got two screens that said ""Transaction Canceled"".. then another screen after the MBTA person came over and said that the machines were working fine. Obviously, they weren't. Or so I thought. I got on the phone with credit card company and the T employee called his ""superiors"". The CC people told me that my statement shows that I charged the card at 8:39AM that morning and so it was up to the MBTA to rectify the situation. The MBTA worker told me that his superiors told him that it was up to the credit card company to rectify the situation. No one wanted to take responsibility for the money that had somehow vanished. Because I didn't have money, I used my change to try and buy a one way ticket. Unfortunately, your machines only takes 20 coins at a time. You should definitely post that somewhere more bold. Luckily, I found a dollar and was able to make it to my appointment in Kendall Square. All out of money,  I walked home to North Cambridge/Arlington from Kendall Square last night. I'm glad my coat had a hood. Life could be worse. I could be homeless or jobless. But I am pretty poor. And I was wondering who would like to take responsibility for my $60. I cannot afford to buy another pass. You guys charged me and didn't deliver the pass. Isn't that illegal? And if it isn't illegal, isn't that wrong? This will probably get tossed into a bin of 1,000. But I figured I'd write, because I just had to say something. This.. is really unacceptable. ----------I tried to file that under refunds, because I realized how many daytime minutes I wasted talking to the credit card company last night.  What can I say? I'm in between paychecks and poor. The MBTA has yet to respond.UPDATE: 4/4/08 Credit card company returned the money to my account. Still no word from the MBTA through phone or e-mail. I'm kind of glad I didn't have to go to an office to argue. I don't know if I could really fight to have a pass to this underground place where I'm groped, stepped on, pushed, forced to wait, and hit in the stomach with a backpack. I mean shouldn't I get paid?",mbta
161,2,"Oct 13, 2006","I could probably write a book  filled with all my rantings and ravings about the T.  I don't want to seem ungrateful, I'm glad we at least have some semblance of a public transportation system, but, at the same time, I get more and more frustrated every time I step onto a bus. A lot of my complaints arise from two bus lines- the 1 and the Silver Line.   I don't have actual stats, but I wouldn't be surprised to learn that those two lines are the most used in the system.  There are a lot of freakin' people on those damn buses.  And, unfortunately for me, most of them are complete fucking idiots.  Some simple rules everyone should follow to make commuting on the T a better experience: 1. Move your ass to the window seat.  Do NOT make people ask to sit down.  When you sit on the aisle, legs spread out like you own the world, you are effectively taking up two seats.  People that do that should be fined and/or banned from the T.  The only time it is acceptable is when there is some really gross wet spot and/or food leftovers in the window seat.  This is especially unacceptable during rush hour when the bus is packed and your fat fucking ass can't be bothered to move.  You are not entitled to two seats, sorry. 2. Strollers.  They are a safety hazard.   It's not my fault you have a three year old to tote around or that you feel the need to cart it around in a gigantic SUV sized stroller.  They shouldn't be allowed on the bus.  And, I should not be expected to CLIMB OVER THE SEATS because you've blocked the entire aisle and your attempt to ""help"" is by pulling the stroller closer to you, leaving an aisle of, oh, four inches.  Not even Kate Bosworth's skinny ass can get through that. 3. Bus drivers, if your bus is full, don't try to pack more people on.  In addition to wanting to get on a bus, many of your passengers want to get OFF the bus when their stop has finally come.  Climbing over people and being pushed around is never an acceptable predicament on the bus.  (I've actually been late to work because I'll wait for the next bus when I see idiot drivers like this--- and yes, the next bus is completely empty).  And, on top of being crushed in like a sardine, we all end up being late.   4. Hey T- how nice of you to inform me to ""expect delays due to heavy traffic in the downtown area""- but by now you should realize that there is ""heavy traffic in the downtown area"" EVERYDAY between 4:30 and 6:00 p.m. and plan accordingly.  When there are 75 people waiting at the silver line stop at Temple then you've officially fucked up. 5. Teenage girls: why can't you sit with your friends?  Why do you have to take up the entire back 12 seats of the bus when there are six of you?  Other people would like to sit in those seats, but we can't because you'll scream and giggle in our ears.   6. Greenline conductors- open all the doors.  Seriously- making people climb all the way from the back, then letting the stream of people on the bus is a twenty minute process.  Do you really care about the T's profit margin?  No, I didn't think so.  There is absolutely no reason for this safety hazard.  It's dangerous!  One entrance and exit on a train?  It's fucking ludicrous!  And, if I ever hear another fucking conductor get on the PA system and yell ""Move towards the back, there's room in the back""  I might actually go postal.  They can't see if there's room in the back.  There isn't room in the back, you idiot.  We all do a pretty good  job of moving to the back even though we know that your one-door-opening ass is going to make it a pain to get out again. 7.  In general- shut the fuck up- don't yell, scream, talk loudly, or bring a screaming child on the bus.  Noise pollution is highly underrated in this city- a little peace and quiet goes a long way.  It's no wonder people try to drown it out with their own iPod noise (which doesn't bother me, hey, if you want to go deaf at 40 that's your prerogative) 8.  The T needs to ban food.  Seriously.  It's disgusting.  I don't want to smell it, see it, or hear someone eat it.  DC bans it- and their subways are surprisingly clean.  This is especially annoying on the overcrowded Silver Line where your trip isn't going to last that long- you can wait till you arrive at your destination instead of risking getting ketchup on the poor schmuck sitting next to you. Things that don't bother me about the T: I don't need it to run all night or until two in the morning, but I'm old and cranky; the orange and red lines are pretty decent; compared to the rest of the world, the T is still cheap- NY, DC, Paris, London, even Denver- all more expensive;  Okay- end rant.",mbta

THE BOSTON MBTA is an outdated and unsafe MONSTROSITY driven by a corrupt state that has it sunk so deep in debt that can't even pay the banks interest.  The Red Line breaks down hourly - and its overcrowded and outdated cars leave commuters freezing on un-sheltered platforms in the winter.  There are never any police to be found underground on the train or platform.. the Transit Police are all out sitting in a cruiser on the street - far away from the violence underground.The tunnels between Alewife and Harvard are collapsing during the rainy season and the whole system is in need of a major change due to the fact that modern cars cannot be placed on the old tracks which are too small.  The state and federal government does nothing about it.Try riding the so called ""Silver Line"" through the Ted Williams tunnel and tell me if you don't have back pain from the experience.

Today's commute is another poor example of the subpar service Keolis/MBTA provides on the Worcester/Framingham line. We were trapped on a train that came to a complete stop at Wellesley Hills, due to mechanical trouble. One conductor provided the option to jump on a train heading back to Worcester. Why would I want to go back to a stop I just left?Twenty minutes later we were told that only 55 people had the option to get on a bus that was coming to shuttle passengers to Back Bay and South Station. What about the other passengers that did not make the cattle call to get on the shuttle bus?  Someone could argue that we were kidnapped by Keolis/MBTA today, as we were being held against our will on a train with no lights or central air. Today is another example of what always begs the question: What warrants the next fare increase? Guess what, it was announced that we can expect another one very soon.

I've come to accept that just because I have to be at work in the morning at a certain time doesn't mean we're on the same schedule, I've adjusted for it. There's also those stupid turnstiles which half the time don't work or register my card incorrectly. And when they do work properly there's always 1 or 2 slackers that runs up behind me to forgo paying their fare. Actually there was one time when your turn style at Park Street was broken and I went right on through, since I had a monthly pass anyways. I was stopped by an undercover cop for that. At least I think she was a cop . She was dressed in plain clothes but flashed me her gun and not her badge. I assume she was a cop since she didn't rob me after asking to see my Charlie Card.

Christopher M. mentioned nothing good about it and Kris A only had a good point of it actually existing. Tough crowd! Maybe you have to live in Boston to know whether or not it is something that is good for the town, but being a tourist in Boston, I would not have survived without it. It was easy to use and covered all the spots I needed it to from the airport, downtown, South Boston, Harvard, and all the way to Quincy.It wasn't the cleanest ever but in comparison to other subways I have been on, it was above average.

In a city the size of Boston with a large metro area......they need to find a way to run past midnight on the weekends.  Many people that go into Boston to the bars, drive in because they know they'll be stranded if they stay past the 11 o'clock train at North Station or the midnight subway train.  In an effort to curb drunk driving and present better service the MBTA union should find an acceptable middle ground for 24-hour service.  Without a full-time public transportation system, Boston will always be a step behind other major cities in the world that are more available to visitors and residents of the area.",mbta
186,1,"Sep 2, 2012","Every single B line train I've tried to take this past week has been a 20 minute wait, and considering people were already at the stop, I can only add the assumed time they were waiting to the tally.On top of that, every single train went express after I got on it. One time the guy at Harvard Ave. in the truck even tried to get me to pay again to get on the next train after the previous one went express.Hahahahaha. No, sorry, it's not just that we live here. It's not. NYC and Japanese train lines deal with much more volume: train-wise and people-traffic wise. The MBTA is simply poorly run and scheduled.",mbta
187,1,"Aug 22, 2012","I can not possibly FATHOM how someone could give the MBTA 5 stars.....they must be referring to another MBTA somewhere...This is not the MBTA I know of dating back to the good ole token days....1) a few nights ago the 11:26 pm B train (3606A) going outbound from pleasant street doesn't stop for me while I'm at the rear car area of the platform. The driver looks directly at me as he drives by. I take this train nightly from work so I know it's another 25 minutes until the next train and it's raining slightly. Being that I work in a gym: I run past the train and get on at Packard's Corner.The driver says to me I wasn't on the platform, so just get on the train and stop complaining. I asked how he knew I wasn't on the platform if he knew where I ran from? He then refused to give me his driver I.D. number. This is absolutely ridiculous, and this crap happens almost daily.2)This morning the train is 20 minutes late, and when we get to Packard's Corner it apparently is going express: but the driver DOES NOT make an announcement. The other passengers are left to ""telephone line"" it to the back of the train. The driver then starts getting pissy and I confront him asking how he thought this was the riders' fault and not one of the MBTA? Then he closes the door on my face.3)I have COUNTLESS memories of: doors closing on my face while I'm on the platform, trains going express w/o announcements, trains/ busses being severely late. I remember for instance the last snowstorm we had. I was on the 57 coming around the Union Square corner in Allston. The bus has maybe 5 people on it, in a very heavy snowstorm. The bus did not stop from St. Elizabeth's Until Harvard Ave @ Brighton. I saw ~20 people in total standing outside including elderly, people with strollers, students with backpacks. This is not an isolated case.I've voiced several complaints and have never received much at all aside from ""there are delays.""5 stars? Who paid that reviewer? Ask any one in Boston about a review for the MBTA. I would gladly bump it up to 2 stars if the MBTA hadn't simultaneously cut services while hiking the fare.MBTA= Mostly Bad Transportation Assistance*p.s. this was posted on another MBTA page...I do not understand why there are so many MBTA pages...*",mbta
188,2,"May 28, 2007","I bitch a lot about the New York subway, but after spending some time in Boston I realize we actually have it pretty easy in the Big Apple. First, the price of the Boston subway is outrageous. It recently jumped from $1.25, which was reasonable, to $2, which is a total ripoff. For your information, a subway ride in NYC is also $2, but there are over 20 subway lines and you get two rides for free when you buy 10. In Boston where there are about 5 lines $2 seems hardly justified.Second, the subway doesn't run at night... this may seem like a small point, but it pretty much means you have to pay for a cab ride if you want to stay out after 12am... ridiculous and incredibly annoying.Third, it really isn't very reliable. I have been stuck between stations for 30 minutes before, and I am not exaggerating. ""We are momentarily being held by traffic ahead of us""... this works for a few minutes, but after half an hour without any serious explanation or even an estimate of how long we're being delayed I start getting the urge to smash people's heads with a baseball bat, and I am the most laid-back and cool-headed guy you'll ever meet. Seriously, it would be faster to walk! What saves it is the relative cleanliness of the stations, although the trains at the end of the day are so littered you have to watch your step... Is it really too difficult to pick up your trash when you go?",mbta
189,3,"Jun 23, 2006","Complain all you want, the T is better public transportation than is available to most people in the United States.  It needs improvement -- maintenance is long deferred, communication suffers from a clear lack of guiding leadership philosophy on the subject (namely that it's important), and the system suffers from design flaws owing to the unavoidable realities of its history.  But let's not go around whining too much.  Go try living in the suburbs without a car sometime and tell me how bad dealing with the T is by comparison. The T's biggest problems stem from how the state funds it.  Right now the T carries the highest debt load of any transit agency in the country, a result of fiscal restructuring imposed upon it in 2000 by the legislature.  It cannot expand any more, it cannot run later hours, it cannot avoid fare increases, and it ultimately cannot continue to operate if this condition doesn't change. So it's in your hands.  If you think the T sucks, well, it's because you're not going to your legislator to tell him/her to end the debt burden and allow the T breathing room.  You have to remember, a lousy T means politicians always have a cause to champion for you -- they're never going to change anything unless you pressure them to.  I know, I know, first they want you to vote, and now you have to actually do something.  Being an adult in a democracy's a bitch, ain't it?    Bottom line = The T is pretty good, should be much better, and is going to get much worse soon unless you do something about it.",mbta
190,2,"Nov 23, 2012","Dear MBTA, Like many other reviewers have already stated, the MBTA is clean, affordable, has the ever so famous Charlie Card, and runs to many major stops within the city and its suburbs...good job. You've been awarded two stars.But what makes this transportation system stuck in the stone age is the huge annoyance of the trains shutting down at midnight, especially on weekends before bars close. I haven't read up on why this is still in effect (as I'm sure it has been hotly debated), but it seems absolutely nonsensical to everyone who lives outside of Boston. Bars close at 2; subways close at midnight. It isn't rocket science. Not having the commuter rail at night means more drunk driving. Most of us do not feel like paying the creepy chain-smoking cabbies $100 to drive us home, especially when there's a commuter rail stop within our town. And we wonder why there are so many accidents on i93...So do us all a favor MBTA and my beloved city, and end the frustrating arguments between my friends and I about who will be the DD, if it's worth it to drive into Boston, if we should go to that crappy townie bar or not, and if men have the ability to develop breast milk.

191,1,"Feb 6, 2019","I wish I could give ZERO stars. The MBTA is a disgrace to the state of Massachusetts. I have been logging complaints about ONE bus driver since September 2018, who blatantly disrespects us CUSTOMERS, by showing up late to the bus stop (after the posted departure time on every posted schedule possible) and then parks the bus to take a 10-15 minute bathroom break. My son who relies on this said bus, is Tardy to school EVERY single day, but whoooooooooo cares, right? You want these children to be positive, active, SUCCESSFUL members of the community, yet you show them that people can waste their time and function on their own accord, without any regard to others? If my son skips school because his bus has him waiting in the cold, he's a bad kid, right? Never mind that he shows up EARLY to be responsible and HE is the child. The MBTA operates because WE pay for it! That bus driver has a job, because of US... but he gets to not do his job properly and still receive a paycheck? But mine should be compromised because you have poor disciplinary policies and I am showing up to work late? My son gets punished for showing up to school late, but a grown man gets to walk around like he is invincible? Oh, but the solution is WE should find another route? Why should we be inconvenienced instead of your company DOING IT'S JOB! I will forever not recommend ANY single human being to takethe MBTA, or offer support.

Then, when we contacted MBTA Revenue office again, They gave no apology for any inconvenience. By any human error and machine error, it took over a month and 5 charlie cards and 4 mail postage and  my time. It is so not worth all the inconvenience.AS FOR SERVICES, they never mob the floors on the trains, or sanitize the handles and seats. I often see them as union workers as they never work with passion at any station.The shabby tracks are another matter. I think wrong people are running the business and this is a typical sign of poor controls. New overseeing government is necessary to change these.

If you live in Boston, you shouldn't take the T like a tourist.As to scheduling on the buses, there are apps for your iPhone or Droid called ""NextBus"" which is a geo-location app notifying you about the arrival of the next transport with up to the minute data.  Also, the Silver Line has been pretty reliable, and I sometimes take the Number 9 bus to Southie and no problems.I should add as a caveat that I am not a daily user.  Probably 15x a month.  I could see how frustrations would grow.  But remember, do not compare the T to private transport.  It is public, and as such, you do have to be with the public.  There's nothing the T can do about  Boston's public...unfortunately.",mbta

199,4,"Jan 7, 2016","First of all, people need to realize that the MBTA was the First Subway in America! Thats right folks. Therefore a lot of the infrastructure today is still based off of the old trolley lines (green line). Each line really deserves its own rating as they all have their quirks and downsides.Green Line: ""The first and the worst."" The part from Park Street to Boylston was the first subway in the entire country!  The trains come very often but its always crowded and very slow. In fact it is now the most crowded Light Rail system in the entire world! The stations are confusing and the trains stop like every 50 feet to wait for a signal to change.I love taking visitors on it is and watching their confusion as it makes awful screeching noises as it winds around very tight turns underground! :)Red Line: ""The Powerhouse of the MBTA"". This line is the mitochondria of the MBTA. Its fairly clean and efficient and comes pretty often. Yes, there are occasional signal problems but its more reliable than the other lines. This is because it is one of the ""newer"" lines built by the mbta (still pretty old though) and was designed as a subway system to begin with, not a trolley system.Orange Line: ""The great depression--a ride-along journey"". This line is pretty sketch. In fact the most sketchy of all the lines. Trains are very very old and do not come very often (every 15 minutes). Trains are crowded, stations smell terrible. I am a guy and would also not want to travel on this line at night alone. Also there's the fact that there were like 3 fires on it one year that makes me hesitant to take it :)Blue Line: ""Who even takes this?"" Its empty, clean and efficient. The tunnel on the harbor to the airport was dug by hand back in the 1900's or something. Its impressive.  Also the airport station is not at the airport--you must take a bus to the airport.",mbta

He still talks about the horrible experience and asks if it has improved at all and if  we still use tokens (no and yes).You could eat off the floor of a Boston trolley compared to what we have here. Still, I give the MBTA three stars because I remember what it was like to leave work and cram into a hot D line trolley filled with smelly Sox fans who totally could have gotten off at Kenmore but don't feel like walking the extra couple blocks because they're too fat and lazy and oh my god their kids are so annoying, ect.

We figured that the best value would be to buy the 7 day pass even though we were only going to use the train for 2 days. You can buy the train passes at all the subway stops. Let me tell you.... it was the best decision ever! Boston is small and everything is close. When I say close, I mean, within 2-3 stops from each other. If you've taken the Chicago CTA or the transit system in NY, Boston's train system is a walk in the park! Signs were posted and we didn't get lost at all. If we come back to Boston in the future, we will be taking the train everywhere. The only downside is that they stop running at 12:30am. Other than that, I think it's the best way to get around Boston on a budget. It's quick and cheap. Can't beat it.",mbta

Several others have told me this happened to them as well.",mbta
204,4,"Nov 13, 2009","During my stay in Boston, I split my time walking, taking the T and cabbing it. I walked whenever I could which caused me to be tired and try the T. And when that wasn't running, I cabbed it. Of the three options, I liked the T best.It was cheap.It was fast.It was entertaining. Walking to a stop always felt like an adventure. Would the machine today be finicky? Take debit but not credit card? Take credit card but not debit? How about cash? Oh, not this machine. It was a death match between me and the machines. Sometimes they were wily but I was more clever. No debit card? Fine. Let's try the credit card. Oh ho! You don't want to take that either? I got cash! I've outsmarted you, you awful machine!Other than that, the system was pretty self-explanatory. The rides are $2 a ride. If you got on the wrong one (i.e. inbound instead of outbound), you could always ask someone where the next next stop was so you can switch over. I took mostly the red line which I found smooth. The green was slower and curved a lot. I felt imminent sickness coming about. But once I took the orange all the way out to go visit the Sam Adams Brewery. Lastly, we took the silver line to the airport. Apparently this was a bus instead of the subway. Okiedoke.All rides were uneventful except during rush hour. The conductor was yelling at people the whole time not to lean on the doors and not to hold them. I would think people wouldn't want to fall out or lose limbs. Hm.I think next time I'd buy a week long pass though. I managed to spend about $22 for the T for just a few short days. Then again, it is cheaper than cabbing it.",mbta

This is how riots are started!Their Charlie Card auto renewal is a mess.  I signed up for it and after three months of having the money withdrawn from my account, but being told ""Not enough value"" whenever I tried to swipe my card, I gave up on that idea.  My tip to you is just renew with the machines at the stations.Also...when I first moved to Boston, I actually believed the T driver when he said that a train was directly behind this one.  Yeah, after waiting 20 minutes for the next train I never fell for that one again!  Ugh there's so much more that I can say, but I'll end with telling the MBTA that it is possible to run 24-hour train/bus service.  Stopping by 1am?!  Get real.

Even when you go on that site it says NO SERVICE UPDATES AT THIS TIME.  I beg to differ this is a website to show the schedule and clearly there is a schedule change!

210,2,"Sep 4, 2007","I loathe public transportation but I can't live without it.  I have witnessed the growing pains of The T for years from the age of 5, crawling under the turnstile since my fare was free, to this past weekend where I had the pleasure of riding for an hour from the orange line to Harvard square for the grossly-inflated fare of $1.70.  I don't think much has changed nor has service improved but prices have certainly risen.  I yearn for those years in the not-too-distant past that it was $0.85 per ride.I think that all the lines with the exception of the above-ground green line trains are fairly dependable (you miss one then you know it's abut a 15 minute wait).  Last train is a little after midnight so it's not an option if you plan on a late night.The system is fairly straightforward for it's easy to navigate as a visitor or a new transplant.  I would avoid hopping on the T as much as possible - for many locales, it's faster to walk than take the T. My biggest criticism besides the standard uncleanliness and undependability (where you're stuck on a stalled car for what feels like an eternity) that you would expect from any public transportation system no matter how great it is, is that the hours and frequency of the trains is subpar.  Unfortunately, it's a chicken or the egg situation.  The volume of ridership won't increase without such improvements and without increased ridership,  the MBTA lacks the funds to increase train capacity and frequency.  Whenever I return to Boston, I find myself pondering whether I should drive in or take the T.  Then I think back to those times I was stuck on Comm Ave on winter nights, icicles forming on my eyelashes waiting for an inbound train that wouldn't show up for 25 minutes.  Or those times I was stuck in unventilated Park Street station unable to get on a train because they were all full....each and every one, one after the next.  Or those times in high school after finishing up extra-curricular activities and waiting for the bus in the evening, only for the bus to drive right past me and my friends as if we weren't all congregated under the bus stop sign and waving our hands feverishly for it to stop.  9 times out of 10 I just drive because it just isn't worth the risk of getting screwed by the MBTA.",mbta

Heading downtown I can catch a B, C or D line FAST and during commute hours, I usually don't have to wait more than 2 minutes to hop on a subway car. There is a caveat to the increased number of trains running durring rush hour, though, and that is that the cars stop often inbetween stations - I guess their tunnels get ""rush hour traffic"" too, so more trains but long ride times from destination to destination. There needs to be a way to stay on a subway car and go from the Back Bay area across to Cambridge without switching to a bus. It takes me an HOUR to get from Kenmore to Alewife during rush hour, and I can easily ride my bike 5 miles almost as the crow flies in less time. Going all the way downtown to the Park Street stop to get on the Red Line outbound to Cambridge is really obnoxious. It's like travelling in the shape of a horseshoe to get from Back Bay to west Cambridge. Probably a crossing subway at the Mass Ave bridge could work. It's cheaper than having a car but at times it's simply less of a hassle to ride a bike somewhere instead of taking the subway.. Some of the stations are clean and gorgeous.

Last inbound bus seen @ approximately 5:30pm. 70A arrived @ 6:09pm. Waited exactly 16 minutes. Did not call MBTA. CentralSquare schedule for 47 bus lists departure @ 6:40pm, contradicting MBTA.com which lists the time as 6:35pm.

TWO 70A buses arrived simultaneously. 11/29/07 11:51AM 42OBSERVED 70A stopping about 100+ feet before bus stop. Riders exited. Bus continued down Arsenal Street, failing to stop for rider waiting at designated bus stop. Rider unsuccessfully attempted to gain driver's attention by flailing arms wildly & shouting while chasing bus. Rider was forced to return to bus stop to wait for next bus. 11/29/07 5:50PM clear, dark, 40 70 bus arrived before scheduled time stated on mbta.com - 5:58pm 11/29/07 6:08pm 40OBSERVED 70 bus traveling in opposite direction -2nd since my arrival at bus stop just before 6pm. Still no sign of next due inbound bus. 11/29/07 6:14pm 39 70A arrived. Driver was friendly and welcoming. CONCLUSION: The 70 bus arrived a full 8 minutes early, while the 70A was late by that exact amount. This bloated the wait time between buses to 300% its usual length - stretched the wait from 8 minutes to 24 minutes! 12/18/07 6:20 - 6:54 pm  28 Waited @ Harvard Station for the 77. When I arrived, about 25 people were already waiting. As our wait time increased, the waiting crowd grew. Called MBTA & was given an excuse of ""holiday traffic congestion"". This is ABSURD considering the 77 runs straight up & down Mass Ave, & I already had seen the surface roads in much more highly-congested areas such as Memorial Drive & Harvard Square, where no abnormal traffic was observed. MBTA representative hung up on me. When 77 finally arrived (after at LEAST 35 minutes), two were sent at once to accommodate more than 100 waiting passengers. Still, both buses were standing-room-only. 12/19/07  9:48am 31 Arlington Center, inbound, Mass Ave@Jason St. Stood directly atop snowbank (as no path was cleared in waist-high snowpiles to allow access from sidewalk to road). Was CLEARLY visible standing closer than one foot to the bus stop sign, however, 79 bus failed to stop to allow me to board. Hence, I continued FREEZING for the next 16 minutes while waiting for another bus to arrive. 12/19/07 6:25-6:52pm 33 Have now been waiting for the 77 bus for 27 minutes @ Harvard Station. Schedule lists the 77 route as leaving Harvard Station every 10 minutes or less at this time of day.",mbta

One can go to various museums (the Institute of Contemporary Art is way off the beaten path), take it across the Charles River to Cambridge, see the sights of Super 88, the Boston University Campus, Beacon Hill, the Mother Church of Christian Science.Public transportation tends to be superior on the East Coast than on the West Coast (or the Southwest) The conductors are friendly, one gets helpful announcements, there are maps, the train cars are clean.

233,2,"Nov 16, 2017","The heat is always blasting, whether it's freezing outside or 80 degrees in the summer. On the Providence Line outbound, conductors don't announce the stops. Some conductors are rude while others value their jobs and are worth every cent they're paid. Sadly, good conductors are few and far between. There's a blonde lady who's a real sweetheart and she's usually taking tickets on the 5:50pm train. Sure the prices are astronomical, but she has a great personality so forking over my hard earned money is slightly less painful when she's in the cart. The wifi is advertised but it barely ever works. Train was an hour late last month because it was raining the night before. If Boston parking wasn't so expensive, I'd probably just drive to work every day. The Canton Junction station is not protected very well from the elements, so it's always important to wait as long as possible to walk from the parking lot to the station's track maze 11/12 of the year. Some of the train carts are new-ish but others are in their 30s like me, the seats are ripped and very saggy. I'm not fat but I feel claustrophobic in these seats. Between parking and train fare it's about $4 cheaper per day using the train as opposed to driving into the city. I've noticed the outbound trains are late more frequently than the inbound ones -- but they're all too late in general. Whether it's 10 minutes or 60, it's not good. People's jobs are dependent on them showing up on time, or at least the scheduled hour of when companies open. The MBTA is the #1 reason I'll never get rid of my vehicle. Why do the prices keep rising?! Neither service nor quality have risen in decades- and they're always cutting stops or widening the time between trains.",mbta

235,2,"Mar 26, 2009","Ugh. After four years in Boston, including a summer and a semester of taking the Green Line 6 miles downtown and back each day (putting me at nearly two hours of T-riding a day), I can conclude that the T is something I will miss the least.  Having grown up in Washington with the speedy and clean Metro, nothing can really compare.  Still, the T doesn't even come close.  Boston College has the unfortunate position of not only being at end of the Green Line, but situated at the end of the B branch of the Green Line, the bane of the MBTA existence.  Anyone who lives along the B Line route knows exactly what I'm talking about, but for those of you who don't, suffice it to say that the B line literally stops every 25 feet, and is subject to the same traffic lights etc. as other cars, culminating in an hour and fifteen minute commute if you're like me and have to take it the entire way.   The first thing freshman at BC learn is to take advantage of the fact that the C & D lines are a short shuttle ride away on the BC Bus and will get you there so much faster.  Of course, this doesn't even take into account the fact that the T could do one of any number of things once you are already on it:- Break down.- Break down again.- Restart, break down a third time, and require an emergency rescue from another T as you watch the minutes tick by and frantically type an email to your boss about how it looks like you might be late to work, again.- Decide en route to become ""express"" to a certain location, and skip all other stops along that route.  Don't worry though, there is a train immediately behind you making all ""local"" stops.  (What is this, the commuter rail?).  ** Side note: this is actually awesome if you are A) already on the T and B) not among the group of people whose stop was skipped.- This, again, is specific to the Green Line, but don't forget the bottleneck effect at Kenmore where are the lines merge into the underground system.So why two stars and not one?  It looks like the T has been trying to make a comeback in recent years, with new stations in some places and the CharlieCard system.  Though the T has a long way to go to reach the efficiency of DC's Metro, I give it props for trying. And after all, what else is there?",mbta

I think how I dont have to mention anyone who experienced the green line how bad it is. Yes, it is the oldest subway in the US, but it seems that MBTA thinks that we all are visiting a museum, not traveling somewhere. I walk faster than the green line on the major part of its routes. MBTA is a picture of apathetic Bostonians who would not complain to their local government even if they make them pay 100 % more for the ticket and offer less number of trains.  The blue line sometimes is decent and the red line as well. By the most part, I noticed how they have less number of trains on duty than they had before, while charging more for travel and not offering a service that would go at least until 2 am when most of the bars and clubs are opened and many people finish their work shifts.",mbta

No, it's not a perfect system, but the fares are reasonable (though rising!) and with enough planning you can get anywhere you want in the greater boston metro area.

239,4,"Apr 22, 2010","I love subways. I love nice big color-coded subway line maps that spiderweb across a city. I like the automated turnstiles...the roaring rush of a train pulling into a station. For as much as I adore subways, you'd think that I'd live in a city that actually has one. But I do not. Thus, I very much appreciate the ""subway experience"" when I travel elsewhere, and the ""T"" of Boston's MBTA is at the top of the list. The cars are pretty clean, the trains run frequently, and you can easily get pretty much anywhere in the city. It would be nice if they ran all night to accommodate late night revelry, but I suspect MBTA is intentionally avoiding the shenanigans that erupt when bars close their doors. A nice bonus is that many of the T stations have Dunkin Donuts located inside, which seems like a perfect combination for morning commuters.I spent much more time on subways than on buses while in Boston these past few days, and my couple of bus experiences weren't quite as superb as those of the T. The drivers seemed a little abrupt and one was visibly exasperated when I asked whether I ought to run my pass through the fare machine. I took the 71/73 out to Cambridge and back and I can definitely say that the bus wasn't running every 12 minutes on the return trip as expected. No problem for me as I wasn't in a rush, and I can't say whether the delay is indicative of the bus system in general.",mbta

She was 20 minutes behind schedule with another #9 behind her. Starts name calling, yelling, insults me for being slow and is generally aggressive for no reason. When I call her out for being rude,""that's so rude"", she becomes angry and kicks me off the bus. Won't even let me get her driver ID, had to grab bus number instead. Very unprofessional behaviour.

244,3,"Aug 16, 2010","8:00 am Friday after a quick passby of the original CHEERS at Beacon Hill which I walked from the Hertz at Park Plaza, I was pretty much ready for some local flavour public transportation.  The closest subway station was Arlington from a local and she referred to the transit as the ""T"".  BTW, most of my comparison is with Toronto Transit Commission(TTC) of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.When I went down I noticed a service booth with a staff ready to assist when needed, however I also noticed throughout the day that they are not always there so do not depend on them as a reliable source if you're NEW to MBTA.  There are 3-4 Ticketing Machines that are very easy to use and accept most payments.  I had no problem getting my 1-Day Pass($9.00) CharlieTicket but the only negative was that I got $11.00 in one dollar coins which I was warned about from the friendly staff at this Arlington station.  I looked for a green arrow lighted up as I slipped my pass in the slot and it came out on top and the display gave me the go-ahead.  I stepped in front of the plastic transparent barrier and 1 SECOND after, it magically opened up.Be aware that Inbound train means heading towards the CITY while Outbound means to the suburbs.  I waited for the train in a somewhat worn down subway setting which still is better than TTC, however like TTC every station has a different appearance.  Even the trains were different from one line to another, some being modern while another being classical.Much like TTC there are announcements as to the next STOP however when its done in this method it can be missed by the patrons.  On the Orange Line I waited there forever waiting for the next train and sweated up a storm as a few of us struggled for prime position in front of 1 of 2 large fans.",mbta

You need a step ladder to climb onto them, same with some of the Green Line trains.  One car on the Green Line is usually an old one which are much harder to climb into and out of for the mobility impaired.  You never know if it's going to be the first or last car so you stand in the middle of the platfrom somewhere.  There's a scramble for the new car's door when it arrives.  Drivers are sometimes really surly too and revel in slamming doors in the face of passengers rushing to enter the doors.  They scream through the loud speaker alerting passengers to their intent to close the doors right on them as they are trying to enter.  I was once dragged a few feet by an Orange Line train that slammed its doors on my cane and proceeded to drive away despite horrified screams from onlookers.  I was finally jostled free but the driver didn't stop until she had near cleared the station.  Had I still been stuck I would be Yelping to you through a medium.  A rep for the T took my name and info, no one ever called.  Total apathy and loathing for passengers by some factions at the T.  A rabid bum stood on the Park Street platform screaming obscenities at another passenger that had gotten on the Red Line train to Cambridge.  The train sat there idling with the doors open for quite some time, allowing this guy to exorcise his rage filled tirade uninterrupted and threaten the frightened passenger inside while the driver watched from a safe distance.  At the very least they should have closed the door instead of leaving the passenger on board open to be attacked at any time without interference from police or personnel.  People ask me why I wear a coat in summertime.  It's because of the AC that runs on some of the trains and buses on the T.  The air blow gustily and strong down your head and shoulders, especially on the new buses.  The temperature control is minimal from what I understand from the drivers.  It will be 56 degrees out in October and the AC is still on in the bus.  When the T works it's wonderful.  It's better than looking for parking in the city.  If the weather is lousy out leave the car at home.  The T is the best way to go.  Don't be fooled though.  The drunks on the T are that way for a reason.  ;)",mbta

Anyone who is moving to Boston: do not live on the B Line. You will suffer. Why there needs to be a stop every 50 feet is beyond my comprehension. For example the BU East stop and the BU Central stop are not even a full block away from each other. The Pleasant Street and Babcock Street stops are also ridiculously close to one another. And to say nothing of the T during Sox games. Stay away! Just walk, I guarantee it's faster. I agree with the other person who mentioned there needs to be a way to get from Back Bay to Harvard without going inbound to DTC. Also, it would be nice if there was an actual subway connecting Back Bay and the South End. In order to get from Copley to the South End you basically either have to walk or take go in to Boylston and then take that evil Silver Line bus. At least there's a free transfer.

262,3,"Aug 26, 2011","To be fair I want to state I am born and raised in Atlanta, GA so I rarely use public transportation.I have used the MBTA several times over the last 2 years when I come up to visit.  I have noticed that the timing of the trains vary greatly.  I am not sure how anyone up there gets anywhere on time!I really hate how crowded the trains get between 4 - 6 pm. It is obviously they need to run more trains at these times.I vowed yesterday to never ever ever ever take the MBTA to the airport again.  It took me 1 hour and 45 minutes to get from Alewife to the airport because of the timing of the red line and silver line.I know that a lot of my complaints are probably based off being a person who mainly does daily traveling by car because of where I live.  The trains are mostly trash free.  The seats could use a shampoo or too, but I know they won't get it.  The variety of smells (from the subways, trains, and people) can be sad and scary.",mbta
263,1,"Aug 21, 2015","The MBTA is a joke. Not worth paying for delayed service, suspended service, double taps, yada...even in the summer. Can you imagine how it's gonna (not) handle itself when WINTER IS COMING!Couple weeks ago, the commuter rail took 2 hours to reach to downtown Boston from Canton Station, which normally (*sometimes) would take 1/2 hr.And there's no refund for shit service - because they don't do that anymore.",mbta
264,5,"Apr 19, 2007","I hardly ever take the T. I generally walk or bike around the city and I drive to work. But, the MBTA really came through for me today, thus the 5 star rating!  I got a flat tire late last night and had to get to work today in Watertown. So, after a quick 15 minute walk to Franklin & Federal and a quick 15 minute express bus ride on the 504 (where I was the one and only passenger on the bus so he was able to skip the Newton Corner loop) and a 3 minute walk from there, I was at work in 33 minutes! That isn't much longer than it takes me to drive on most days. And the best part was the driver! He was the nicest bus driver I have ever had, hands down. Friendly, happy, helpful...all of that. And when I thanked him for my pleasant bus ride and he told me ""I made his day"".Sure, it did cost $3.50 for a one-way bus ride which would be kind of steep, if you had to do it everyday. But, I did find a free paper on the bus to keep me entertained, which was a bonus.Yeah, I know the T has it's crappy moments with delays and annoying passengers and grumpy drivers etc. But today, the T was perfect. Hopefully my ride home will be just as enjoyable. Who knows, maybe my driver and I were both in good moods today because the rain has stopped and the sun is finally out!",mbta
267,4,"Jun 29, 2007","I find this system easy to use.  I went from the Airport, which was a little challenging with the buses to the subway then hopped on the subway to downtown then off the Alewife Station and found my friend's car in the large but run down parking structure.  The flooring of the parking structure was full of cracks, hard to avoid driving on them.",mbta

That just doesn't make sense.",mbta
270,3,"Jan 24, 2006","I've usually found the T to be reliable. It will get you where you need to go and is damn cheap. Just these three things put it way ahead of the SF MUNI and London Tube (though I prefer the Paris Metro).A few things could be improved however:- it would be nice to be able to go from Back Bay to Cambridge without going via downtown. A line running along Mass Ave would be perfect- the token system is archaic and cumbersome. The airport stop has a nice new ticket system - when is this going to be rolled out?- when something does break down, the backup system is not very good. Last weekend, when the blue line broke, there were replacement busses from Maverick on, but it was total chaos, with no-one knowing where to go or which bus to board. It would also be nice if they let you know that there was a problem right at the entrance to the station, rather than letting you board a train before telling you. That way, people could catch a cab instead if they were in a hurry.",mbta
271,1,"Feb 2, 2015","After the fires, delays and cancellations in the last week; the rating drops.  Not just because of the service,  but the horrible attitudes of the staff and public relations.",mbta
272,2,"Jan 12, 2015","I give them 1.5 because its not yet at the level of a third world country.    Subway service is expensive and unreliable.   The best way one friend put it was  ""The t can get you around Boston in 15 minutes or an hour but you never now which.""  The people working the system clearly are burnt out and hate humanity.   The few times you ask for help with a Charlie card they tell you to just 'hop in behind someone else' rather than get off their seat.Bus service has been surprising in that there is some semblance of a schedule.   However it is a horrible experience with disgusting buses and people insisting on taking up whole sections of the bus.  The cost of keeping a vague schedule is that mbta drivers blow through red lights regardless of who might be in the crosswalk.And the commuter rail.  Late almost daily, but they dont count it if its not more than 10 minutes..then they subtract 5 minutes from the actual delay.   It's significantly late at least once a week.   The dirty cars are packed during the high hours to the point of having people stand.  To add insult to injury,  the employees of this arm of service have some of the worst attitudes.   The culture varies by line but the one I take regularly (Fitchburg express) is bad.   Conductors that are the worst about violating quiet car rules, won't ask some kid to move his bag so an older woman can sit down, they even move slow opening the doors at a station stop.  Only time they show a little life is when someone complains about an issue or collection of tickets.  When someone complains they are quick to either shed blame or just tell the customer they are wrong.   When it's time to collect tix they hustle through so they can hang out together at the end of the train together away from riders.   The fun part of all this is that this line had a great conductor...so much so he was almost a character out of some black and white movie...professional,  nice, high energy,  knew customers names.... but the union forced him out of his position. Oh and bit costs thousands of dollars a year for many to ride the commuter rail There are mbta employees out there that are nice and hardworking people...but from our perspective,  they're outnumbered. Oh and any mbta construction or renovation project costs riders and taxpayers insane amounts of money and 10 times the time any one could reasonably expect.",mbta
273,1,"Jan 25, 2008","This organization is truly a joke.  It is full of hacks who got their jobs because they know someone who works for the state.  When I talk about hacks, I mean the management of the MBTA.  There are a handful of surly drivers, but for the most part, there are a lot of good drivers and conductors.  The T gets only one star because it is incredibly unreliable.  I thank God that I no longer need to depend on the T to get me to work.  Some days it would take 20 minutes to get to work, while on others it could be an hour and a half.  Another problem with the T is that they cannot complete any projects on time or on budget.  Just look at Kenmore station.  It was supposed to be done years ago and it still is far from finished.  What does the T do since they spend so much money on wasteful projects?  The raise fares of course, which drives away commuters.I strongly support public transit, but not when the agency doesn't put commuters first.  Nothing used to piss me off more than when the T's spokespeople would ridicule commuters in the old Starts and Stops column in the Globe.  One more thing, restore the Arborway!",mbta
274,3,"Nov 1, 2010","Okay.  So, I used the T again this October.  It wasn't as awesome as on my first trip, but I suppose it wasn't hideous, either.We stayed out of town (in Braintree) due to the fact that we couldn't get a deal on a hotel in Boston proper.  We found a motel across from a T station and were thrilled.  We only found out when we showed up in Boston that, whoops, the Red Line was being worked on that weekend.  Crap.  So we had to use a shuttle bus for part of the trip.So why didn't I rate the T lower?  Frankly, the employees.  Maybe it's because I'm from the NYC area, but I found every single employee of the T to be friendly and helpful.  Despite the track work, everything seemed to run quite smoothly.  The trip took longer, but there was no confusion.So, not bad, overall.",mbta
275,4,"Jul 10, 2010","Up front: I'm only reviewing the subway, and as a tourist.First, a...question, I guess: I'm not sure how crazy passengers equal a problem with the system itself. I mean, it's *public* transportation, and some members of the public are plain f--king nuts (PFN).Now.  I happened to luuuuurrve my 4 day T experience.  Nearly all the stops are wheelchair-accessible - one can even board without having to find a conductor to find a portable ramp (or pray and do a wheelie).  That alone would've sold me.  But wait!  There's more!  The lovely, color-coded, easy-reader maps are awesome, of course.  The trains themselves seemed clean and seemed to run fairly often.  We didn't encounter any crabby employees (to the contrary - everyone was quite helpful).I understand that delays/breakdowns/drunks can make anyone PFN, but I wonder if they show up any more often than on any other subway line in any other major northeast city (the snow factor).  I'm looking forward to using the T again.",mbta
276,1,"Jan 7, 2010","The MBTA buses need a serious face lift....so gross!!!!I take the bus now only because I'd prefer not to freeze as I walk to work each day. Maybe I should toughen up, but ewwwww!The subway/trains are much more tolerable in my experience but not as accessible to get cross town and to the South End. Oh well, guess I'll just be sucking it up for the winter then back to walking as soon as the weather gets better :-)",mbta
277,1,"Feb 18, 2015","The MBTA was bad before the weather turned ugly but it's even worse now! Long commute, three hours for a trip that should take 50 minutes. Trains and trolleys not running. Tracks not being cleared of snow. Bus stops with huge piles of snow that the MBTA doesn't clear. Our wonderful Governor (NOT) sits around talking about what's not his job in a state of emergency but if he had to get out of that SUV of his and take the T, it would be fixed immediately!  Horrible delays and now they say 30 days to fix it! Thirty days and when it's ""back to running"" the service will probably be as horrible as it was before!",mbta
278,2,"Sep 7, 2014","BLEGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH. The MBTA is the bane of my existence. I'm literally counting down the days until I no longer have to rely on this god-awful service. In fairness, It's mostly the Green Line and the buses (OHHHHHHHHH, the buses) that cause the majority of the headaches. The Orange, Red, and Blue lines are usually OK. USUALLY. But not always. But the Green Line and the stupid buses are the WORST. UGH UGH UGH. I cannot express my contempt for having to rely on both of those terrible parts of the MBTA every single day. The amount of times my commute has been extended by 20, 30, 40, 50, and yes even 60 WHOLE MINUTES, simply because a scheduled bus never showed, or was dreadfully late, or there were ""power problems on the orange line"" or it took 25 minutes to wait for a Lechmere train to finally come to North Station. It goes on and on. Unless your commute is just Red Line only, or Orange Line only, you are likely going to experience some sort of problems. And how is there no crosstown subway??? The only way to get from cambridge/allston areas to the JP/southern areas is to take the 66 (pfffffffft) or the 1 bus (pffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffft) There really ought to be another subway line that addresses these problems. I've seen a few really nice theoretical subway maps that DO address them. I'd beg for their implementation, but since nothing would get done until long after I've stopped using the MBTA, I don't really care. Also, can we talk about how drug deals and usage go down every day at the BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER 1 bus stop? Seriously??? That needs to be addressed. So does pretty much everything else about the 1 bus, but I digress. And the fact that I sent 2-3 emails asking why scheduled 88 buses just never showed and I was stuck waiting 40 minutes in the frigid cold Boston winter waiting for another one to finally arrive? Never answered. Again, I'm am counting down the days until I no longer need to rely on this awfulness.",mbta
281,1,"Jan 11, 2018","If I could give zero stars I would. I'm a nurse in Boston and take the commuter rail on days when I can't drive in and literally almost EVERY time I take the train it is delayed or cancelled, yet they raise prices every year and promise better service. If you can avoid it, don't ever take the train. Not worth it. You'll end up calling into work late almost every day. Not only that, but the MBTA does a terrible job of notifying you that there is a delay while you are at the station. You have to just keep refreshing the app to wait for an explanation of why the train is so late. I often find myself taking a train that is several hours earlier than I need to be taking just because I know there will be a delay. Worst service ever.",mbta

I am writing a review today because I have never gotten such horrible service before. This was on the green line, when for some reason the green line was disabled, so everyone had to wait outside in the rain for the shuttle busses. I waited for the first one... packed. Second one...not packed, but got kicked out because the bus driver changed his mind last minute about sticking to the rules about the ""entire body has to be behind the line"" thing. Third time... 5 minutes passed and no shuttle, so instead I walked 3 stations to change to the red line...",mbta
285,4,"May 21, 2015","I can see how this system would drive commuters crazy but if you're just a visiting tourist this is an experience you mustn't miss! For instance, we all got on one trolley-train labeled ""Heath Street"", then they turfed us off to go over to another trolley-train labeled ""Riverside"" and announced verbally (loud voice!) that the Riverside was now a Heath Street line. This was missed by one passenger who was visibly annoyed once the trolley-train got above ground and she found she wasn't on the Riverside line.  However, if you aren't in a hurry, big ole clanking trolley cars screech their way slowly out of the hub station (Park Street) via tunnels dug over a century ago and then make it out to above ground stops on the roads. But they will take you (sortof) to wherever you want to go, or near enough, with a Charlie card that you can use on bus or trolley etc. It's allegedly wheelchair accessible -- and I did see hand-crank lifts to get wheelchairs into the trolley cars -- but little signage or other written assistance and if there were elevators, they are tucked away so this is going on my ""Not wheelchair accessible"" list.",mbta

294,3,"Apr 29, 2008","It's broke. Both meanings of the word.  It has no money. It doesn't function properly. And the two are related.Totally agreed that it's BS it doesn't function past bar-time. But the MBTA has come out and said it COSTS them more to run the T that late than profit they bring in. Like the T needs to be more in debt than it already is? (How many billions are they in debt already?)It's falling behind, and it breaks my heart to see this system failing so badly when I know it could do better. It's a vicious cycle -- it can't afford decent upkeep, people get mad, they stop using the T, there's less revenue. I don't know how the MBTA is going to turn itself around, but something needs to happen. As other posters mentioned, people complain about public transit in every city -- almost no one loves their public transit. It's a city's punching bag.  I'm pretty forgiving when it comes to the MBTA but, that said, most of the gripes about poor service and deteriorating facilities are totally valid.  The worst thing is that this really is the real face of Boston. Whenever I visit a city I make it a point to check out their public transit -- the state of that transit, to me, speaks volumes about the health of that city and its populace. Public transport -- the T -- is for ""real"" people, not for tourists. So how does it reflect on us as a city that this is how we treat the residents?  I don't feel comfortable with the impression that the T gives our visitors about how we think of ourselves.",mbta

296,3,"Sep 22, 2011","First off, I come from an area with a pretty much D-rated public transportation system. So I, Julie D. am not savvy to the ways of the train system. So, when hopping the train at Copley Station, I wasn't smart enough to pick the one going the right direction. While I am looking at how to cross the tracks to get to the ""other"" side, someone is kind enough to point out to me that I have to go back to the street, cross it, go around the corner and pick that station. Stupid tourist! And, crap, I have already paid my $$. So, I use a nearby phone to call up the help line. They tell me to simply hold up my ticket up big and proud and slip though the gates with another passenger. Well, don't you know a very loud alarm goes off and people stop and stare. But that's okay, because I am holding my ticket up. Gawd, help me. Next issue, the train comes. It is packed with a ton of people. People behind me are pushing to get on, so I go with them. We are like sardines. Did I mention we are going to the Sox's game? Yes, that explains the gazillion peeps on the train. So, someone at the front of our car manages to get stuck in the front door, so it won't close. Then, a message appears on the board saying ""this train is out of service"". Yay. Then there is the announcement on the speaker system, ""this train is out of service"". Double yay. So, people start to shout ""hey, open the door, we need to get off"". Well, the door doesn't open and even if it did, I'm not getting off. This goes on for quite some time. People are getting mean and shouting ""open that door"". Crazy town. I don't think I would want to be in a life or death situation with some of these people. So, finally the door at the very back of the train opens and people start pushing their way out. And about 30 seconds later and door closes. And we are on our way. Gawd. So, the trip was pretty much uneventful after that. And so was our trip back.  The trains and stations seemed pretty clean, however I never got a look at the seats.  I love public transportation.  I wish I had some!",mbta

Oh yeah, they are hanging out near Dunkies or conspicuously absent.  -99.9% of the employees are complete assholes with bad attitudes.  Get off your freaking cell phone!

(see above)-Service ends at 12:45...  'nuff said-I haven't heard it yet but I'll add it to my list - that the MBTA has the audacity to think that most people would want to listen to T-radio.  If your ridiculous vehicle for driving out musicians and making revenue on advertisements was making the service better, longer and safer I would be all for it. I doubt that is the cause.

299,1,"Mar 24, 2010","""Help! I'm stuck in the Downtown Crossing station,"" was how I started my phone call to the MBTA Police a few weeks ago.Not. Even. Kidding.It was a Friday night, a little after 1AM, and a co-worker and I exited the train and passed through one of those old fashioned turn-styles -- you know the kind, the revolving door with black, germ infested bars jutting out like evil teeth...An MBTA drone locked it behind us, which we thought nothing of, and got on the escalator to head towards freedom, fresh air, and, most importantly, last call and a bathroom.  I had to pee like nobody's business.I mean, I really had to pee.I cannot stress this enough.We got to the top of the escalator, walked straight, turned the corner and lo and behold, the grating was down over the exit/entrance to the station.Trapped.We ran down the upward bound escalator, got to the bottom, and started yelling for the MBTA employee who locked the revolving door.  No response.  No luck.  Gone.  That mofo made a suspiciously quick exit.Two phone calls and 35 minutes later, an MBTA car pulls up and two henchmen get out.  Both were disgruntled, androgynous looking things who were completely cold and unapologetic.  I swear one of them had a giant, circular key chain and used a skeleton key on the padlock for the grating.I jokingly tried to convince them to drive us home.  ""No.""  When that didn't work I tried to convince them to hail us a taxi.  ""No.""  Well, boo.I still had to pee.If I didn't have a sense of humor, I'd be pretty angry.  That said, I can't believe how long it took them to respond to our call.  We sat in the cold station for 35 minutes.  People kept walking by staring at us, which really just made me stick my arm through the grate and reach out at them.Anyway, this was a pretty traumatic experience.

312,1,"Oct 18, 2006","I arrived at Kenmore at 10:48 pm last night. No one was there waiting, so I assumed I just missed the bus and would have to wait 15-20 minutes. I didn't have the bus schedule on me, but know that the 57 always runs every 15-20 minutes at that time. 30 minutes later about 40 people were waiting and grumbling with me. The bus finally pulled up at 11:19pm. I grabbed a schedule as I boarded the bus and the bus driver humorously commented: ""Picking up some fictional reading, huh?"" The schedule stated there was a 10:45 bus, an 11:00 bus and an 11:20 bus. The 11:00 bus never ran! This is not the first time that a bus never showed up, and I can't fathom how you can just not run a scheduled bus altogether. It's not that it was a few minutes late - IT NEVER CAME. With the recent announcement of the fare hikes, I find it reprehensible that an entire bus route is just skipped, but I have to pay more. Also, I find it amusing that even the bus drivers know the printed schedules are a joke and they are rarely accurate. I have more skipped bus stories and service complaint stories to count.  But I do appreciate that the service is available - even if it isn't consistent.  Generally, it's decent, but I expect the buses to actually show up.EDIT:  Here is a complaint I wrote in to the MBTA this morning, after another skipped bus service.  I am downgrading my rating to 1 star now.  ""My boyfriend and I went to a concert at Harper's Ferry last night.  I got tired and took the car home early.  Tom said he would stay until the concert ended and take the bus home.  We know the 57 schedule and know there are trains until at least 12:30.  The concert got out at about 12:15 am this morning.  Tom waited at the bus stop, but became cold, so started walking home toward Brighton Center.  We live along the 57 route, so he walked along, pausing at each bus stop, hoping to catch the bus the rest of the ride home.  When he finally got home after 1 am, he had not seen one bus pass him, neither inbound nor outbound.  If there are supposedly buses being run at 12:30 in each direction, and according to your schedule it only takes approximately 18 minutes to get from Kenmore to Watertown Yard, how did he not see one single bus on his walk from Brighton Ave through Washington Ave?  This service is despicable.  People count on your service to get them home and instead, they are forced to walk over a mile and a half in the middle of the night. The price increases are an outrage, considering you don't even run bus service after 12:15, even though you say you do.  If driving didn't cost so much, and parking were more readily available, I would boycott the MBTA altogether, given the horrendous service I've experienced.  It's been especially heinous these past few months that I've been living in Brighton.  This is the second time I've complained in two weeks about a missed trip on the 57. I don't often take the 57 because I commute in on the 503.  However, my last experience on the 57 was a skipped bus from Kenmore and now, my boyfriend had to walk home because another bus didn't run.  How can we plan to use the service if two out of the last two times we've tried to take it, it hasn't even run on it's scheduled times???  You're batting 1000 here, but not in a good way.""",mbta
313,1,"Nov 25, 2014",The MBTA is the. worst. The idea that anyone would give this operation anything over one star blows my rushed and frenzied mind. I used to show up to work and social functions on time. I prided myself on my punctuality. Now I leave my house for a place that takes me 25 minutes to bike to and arrive in about an hour. On a good day. Green line trains show up in inconsistent waves and packed with flying elbows and disgruntled commuters. Orange line smells like urine and is only marginally better in its organization. And the Red Line seems to choose which doors to leave open based on which side has less people needing to board a train. Boston is a decent city but the MBTA feels like a failed middle schooler's attempt at transiting commuters to and from their daily destinations.,mbta
314,3,"Apr 4, 2012","An A-OK public transportation system.The good: It is well organized and reliable. Stops are conveniently located. Between trains and buses, it is possible to get almost anywhere in the city. The Silver Line was a great addition. Fares are reasonable.My wish list: I wish the Green Line didn't stop every two blocks. I wish there were some sort of Red Line-Green Line connector out west so I didn't have to travel 90 minutes or more to get to Newton from Davis (a drive that takes 15-20).""The next train arrives in XX minutes"" signs like they have in DC would be nice. More detailed information on delays would also be nice. ""Attention customers, the Red Line is currently experiencing delays"" can mean anything from ""There was a disabled train earlier but things are back to normal now,"" to ""Things are going to be a bloody mess for the next several hours so don't bother waiting.""In a lot of the cars--it seems like more than half--the intercom either doesn't work or is turned down so low that it's inaudible. This might seem like a non-essential feature, but whenever there is a problem (often) it becomes really, really important. When there is a delay, It doesn't help that the driver is making announcements every two minutes if nobody can hear it.My best example: I was taking the train home from Harvard Square to Davis, as I do nearly every day, and standing on the outbound platform as usual. I was confused when a train pulled in going the opposite direction. it was announced that an outbound train would be coming shortly.When the next train came, it was going in the right direction, so I got on. And waited. And waited. And waited. At least 10 minutes, maybe 15, as the train filled up. No announcements were made (that I could hear). Then, the announcer came over the intercom: ""The next stop for this train will be Central."" WRONG DIRECTION! The train was turning around and going inbound! I hastily exited the train before the doors could close and asked a T worker on the platform if there would be an outbound train coming soon. She rolled her eyes, gestured to the lower platform, and said, ""That train already left. We MADE the announcement."" So, they had inbound trains leaving from the outbound platform, outbound trains leaving from the inbound platform, and a worker standing right on the platform who couldn't be bothered to walk up and down the train making the announcement at the open doors of a waiting train, since the PA system was apparently broken (or not--they managed to announce which station was next!). At that point I just gave up and took the bus instead.The charade they go through every spring--threatening to jack up fares and cut service drastically (e.g., threatening to eliminate all bus lines), holding the legislature hostage until they get their budget funded, which they ultimately always do--is annoying.The commuter rail is pretty good if you are in fact commuting into Boston from the burbs. However, it would be nice if the service were more frequent at off-peak times. It would be nice to be able to take the train to my friends' place in Wakefield on a weekend, but there are trains only every 2 hours or so. If you go to Providence for some Saturday-night fun and want to come back to Boston at the end of the night, you've got to be on the train by 10 p.m. The first train on Sunday isn't until 11:20!!And of course, I wish the T ran 24 hours. I essentially can't take the train to the airport if my flight leaves before 8 or 9 a.m., because the first train is 5:30ish. And if you get in close to midnight, good luck if your flight is delayed at all. You're looking at a $40 cab ride.But all in all, my life is far better with the T than it would be without it.",mbta

Try having to own a car, or else wait 45 minutes, average, for busses that very often don't run on time.  And whose operators are generally anything but friendly.  Try living in a ""city"" that is so spread out that there is very little general community--only pocket neighborhoods--and might as well call itself a big town.  A public transport system as integrated as this one is a huge element in making Greater Boston a pedestrian city, and in my view they're not doing badly at all.Oh, and (strangely) except for at Copley station, three times in a row, the agents have all been cool as fuck, quite helpful, and friendly.god bless the MTBA (neither piety nor irony intended).Some of you don't know how good you have it.

But of all the places I've been (L.A., D.C., NYC, Atlanta, Chicago, Dublin, Boston, etc.), Boston has the fastest and most regular system I've seen. Maybe that isn't saying a lot. Maybe all of our systems need overhaul. But I never have to wait long for a train when I'm here, and there's always a station near the places I want to go (even in the near 'burbs), it isn't overly expensive, and it's relatively clean (except for that one station, but we won't talk about that).

A few weeks ago there was a small snow storm, so the T was shut down between Central and Downtown and we had to take a bus to the next stop but the driver didn't tell us when we were at each stop.  When someone asked why the T was shut down the response from the MBTA worker was ""it is snowing and the elevator is broken"".  I don't know if that makes sense to anyone else.Another time the commuter rail was over 2 hours late and no one showed up to tell the hundreds of morning commuters to find another way to work.  Even an announcement would have made me feel slightly better but we were all left stranded and wondering...ALSO, wayyyyyy too many stop on the buses.

I did just read -- in the metro newpaper that they hand out for free (+1 star for real human hands that you can say good morning to consistently) in front of subways stations --  that partially because of our mass transit system, Boston is the second best city to live in just in case we have some crazy oil supply shortage.

Well, I suppose I forgot that#1 This is Americaand#2 Boston just don't give a f*ckEven the Czech Republic has a more efficient system. I want to cry every time I ride the T and that's at least once a day. What is up with the pointless test trains every hour? What needs to be tested so often? What is up with half-full trains that don't stop for no reason whatsoever? What is up with the dirty floors? Do they ever get cleaned? Can they clean them while they test them? Why are the stations so ugly? Why do trains not come for 15 minutes, then 3 at once even going outbound (before street level) Please, someone, overhaul this system. I'm also pretty unhappy with the general geographical area the T travels. First of all, why is there no easy way to get across the river? Why are there stops every 30 feet by BU? Kids can walk. All I can say is, if you think the T is great then you should never travel. Once you go to Europe and see the amazing technology in places like Berlin and Paris (where I lived for a short time - I will kiss the metro the next time I go) you will never be able to withstand the Boston T.

The monthly pass that includes unlimited train and bus service is 59 dollars. That's about 1 round-trip a day; on face value, it doesn't seem like a deal. If you make multiple trips a day, or if you make a stop on your way home, however, it will definitely save you money. I live right on the green line so I hardly ever take a bus.

But in all honesty, if you visit other places, you'll quickly come to realize that the T is generally clean, and cheap in comparison to other systems (I'm looking at you NYC). The heavy rail subways (blue, red and orange) move pretty fast, with reasonable frequency. The light rail line (green) is pretty slow, but realistically, the b and c lines could be better served by dedicated bus lanes than by rail. Are there things that they could do better? Yes, of course. But let's give them a little credit for what they do right. Boston is fourth in the country for the percentage of people who use transit, and fares are really low compared to other systems.",mbta

The lady I was with, she and I wanted to check out Plymouth Plantation so we caught the Red Line to South Station, caught the commuter rail to Plymouth, took a bus a ways and then walked a few blocks and there we were.  We went everywhere this way and loved it.  You can kind of do that in the SF Bay Area but it is tricky at times.  We loved the versatility and functionality of it and were envious of what a cool system it was.",mbta

339,3,"Jan 28, 2008","Talk about a mixed bag. The thought of even trying to write coherent paragraphs about the T makes me want to adopt the rocking fetal position in a corner of the room. Instead, I'll stick with the good, the bad, and the ugly.The good: -The red line has rarely, if ever, let me down. No transportation system is ever going to be perfect, but in my opinion, the red line is the best in Boston as far as staying on schedule, accomodating crowds, and taking you from point A to point B in a reasonable amount of time.-All of the green lines are far from perfect, but I can usually live with the C line. It seems to run more frequently than its green counterparts, and it doesn't take too too long. It also stops at places that I actually need/want to go. Yeah, the D is quick and there aren't many stops, but how often do I really need to go into suburban Newton?The bad: The green B line. Ugh, where to begin. Okay, it's a nice convenience to have a T stop literally steps from my front door, and obviously that beats the alternative of not having one nearby. But living and commuting at Harvard Ave. has to be one of the single most frustrating experiences alive. Back when I used to work in Government Center, it was always a total crapshoot trying to judge when I would arrive at work, particularly if the weather was bad, because apparently Harvard Ave. is the do-or-die cut off point for express trains. I can't tell you how many times I've seen a train stop just up the street, but then blow by the tons of people waiting in the rain, snow, or freezing cold, leaving them with looks on their faces like they're ready to kick Lassie. (There is a flip side to this of course- if you're on the train that gets expressed, seeing the look on those suckers' faces is one of life's small pleasures.) My biggest gripe with the B is its lack of consistency. You just never know what you're going to get with it. The ugly:Goddamn you 66 bus. First, if I wanted to deal with traffic, I would get a car, so that part is my own fault. But how is it that the MBTA STILL has not figured out how to space these things out even somewhat evenly? If I had a nickel for every time I've seen two 66 buses putt-putting up Harvard Ave doggy style, I would be a rich man. It drives me absolutely batshit, to the point where I regularly risk the loss of one or more extremities by walking to work in the freezing cold, rather than wait to see if I will be blessed with the presence of a 66 within a reasonable time frame.",mbta

343,3,"Feb 11, 2008","Figuring out how many stars is difficult--I mean, should I rate the MBTA in the context of transportation networks in the U.S.?  In the developed world?  In the known universe?  I couldn't decide, so I averaged the three ratings:Context of the U.S.: 4 stars.  The major plusses are:- Racially and socioeconomically integrated!  After living in Boston for a while, I had forgotten than in America, white people drive, and people of color people take the bus.  Recent trips to Philly and DC made me appreciate that in Boston, people with the means to own a car do not see taking public transportation as slumming, and melaninically-challenged people do not have an aversion to being locked into a passenger cabin with blacks or latinos.- Inexpensive! Granted, for just 30 cents more, you can travel anywhere on the much more extensive NYC subway, but compared to any other city in the U.S., it's hard to get somewhere far and get there efficiently for only $1.70.- Decent connection to the airport! Both the blue line and the silver line bus, which, for a bus, is pretty sweet, more or less go to the airport, and with enough frequency and consistency that you're not going to miss a flight because you got unlucky with the T.  To get to the airport in San Francisco you have to take the infrequent BART, and in DC you can't get there (there = Dulles) yet, and in Philly it's really expensive and the rest of the transportation system sucks so unless you live near where the airport train goes, it's difficult.   Major minuses:- Silly, silly layout.  Yes, the T has to deal with the cow-path-based geography of Boston, and yes, it was built incrementally rather than conceived of rationally as an integrated system, but just because it's not the current T's fault that its layout is lousy doesn't mean it doesn't get docked for it.  I mean, the orange and green lines downtown are a friggin' block away from each other?  Why not space them out so you can cover more of the downtown?  Also, stops on the green line (mainly the B and C) are unnecessarily close together.- No express trains.  This is especially a problem on the green line, where, due to stops at intersections, trains frequently get bunched up at busy times.  Occasionally, the crowded, slow train in the front will declare itself an express train and skip a couple stops, which makes eminent sense, but there really should be a more regular system of expressness.- Buses are infrequent and don't stick to the schedule.  Taking the bus is workable if one of the following is true: (1) you have tons of time on your hands and a book of crosswords; (2) the bus picks you up on schedule and drops you off on schedule.  This requires planning on your part, but even in the cell-phone age, most of us can still do it; or (3) the bus is frequent enough so it doesn't matter if there's no schedule or it doesn't follow it.  Unless (1) applies, MBTA buses with a few exceptions are not workable.  Sometimes they're early, sometimes they're late, sometimes they're so late that it's as if they were early.- Stops at 12:30.  In most of the U.S., people drive drunk all the time.  This happens less in Boston thanks to the T, but if it ran later on Friday and Saturday (like the usually-stopping-at-12:30-but-staying-open-till-3:00-on-weekends DC metro does), we'd all be better off.  Fund the later weekend hours with a 1-dollar surcharge on drinks dispensed after midnight--people will be happy to pay a few more bucks when staying out late if they then save big on cab fare.Context of the developed world: 2 stars   Major pluses:Eh, not many.  It's not a complete loss, so it gets more than just one star.  But come on, three train lines, one of which nobody uses (blue line), a couple streetcars (green lines), worthless buses--just this for what's supposed to be a second-tier world-class city?  Major minuses:As you can see, some of the minuses have been included in the pluses section, so here's a list w/o explanation:- Usually quicker to ride your bike.  If the weather weren't so awful in the winter and Americans didn't have an aversion to biking to work, no one would bother with the T.- Bumpy, jerky, rickety old rails and trains.  The U.S. may be the richest country in the world, but you'd have no idea and you'd lobby your government to be more generous with its foreign aid if all you saw of America were the MBTA.- The MBTA has the chutzpah to pretend that the Silver Line is the equal of the actual rail lines.  The comfort and efficiency of a bus, at the price of a subway!- Seriously, mold colonies in Europe and Japan have better transit systems. Context of the known universe: 3 stars.

(Right now, the island of Oahu is in the process of building an above-ground transit system, which I am not in favor of. Which is a totally different story/review...) I got a 7 day pass ($18), which I used only for a few days, but was well worth it. Getting from point A to point B to point C in only a few minutes, and not being stuck in traffic! The wait for the next train was never more than 5 minutes. BONUS at one of the stations, their was a guy playing a bass guitar for tips. He was pretty damn good! As for complaints... 1) Never use the elevator! I rode in 2 different elevators at 2 different stations and they both smelled like urine! My advise, don't be lazy and TAKE THE STAIRS! LOL! 2) Don't rush, leave a little early! One morning we had Duck Boat Tour and had to make it to the Prudential Convention CTR, but one of the trains had mechanical problem. Instead of waiting, we walked from Kenmore Square. It took about 30 minutes. So be prepared! 3) A couple of times we had trouble with our tickets. Once, my ticket got stuck and keep on going in and out of the turnstile machine. I had grab it and yank it out. Another time, my wifes ticket didn't even work. Luckily a janitor was present, he let us in. So would I recommend MBTA? YES!!! I know I have a few complaints, but the positives out weight the negatives.

It left 30 minutes after game time, as promised, but once we started up we stopped and just sat on the train for a solid 20-25 minutes without any announcement. That's my biggest pet peeve with the T - lack of communication. I can handle delays if I know what's up!  I would definitely recommend going to South station to board if you have the time.

I remembered I was late for class because of the train. The mbta should know that there are people who has places to go to, and majority of them go to work or school in Boston. Therefore, we can't afford to be late. Another factor is that some of the conductors are rude to the passengers. I remembered a conductor won't let my friend go into the subway because he ""doesn't look like a soldier"" when he's clearly in his uniform AND showed him his military ID! SERIOUSLY?!? I've been on the subway for years and I've never heard anything like that. My friend have no problem passing through as long he showed them his ID (which is a policy I saw looking through their website); conductor let soldiers go in for free as long they show them their military ID. But this conductor was so rude to him! I also have other very rude and weird stories while I was on the mbta.And the cost for the mbta is expensive as well. However, thank god they have discounts and passes for making a commuter's life easier.

Circle line--- though expensive, a circle line running from somerville-brighton/brookline-JP-South End/Back Bay-Cambridge would unify multiple lines and give a myriad of options to the rider.  Suddenly it would make sense for tens of thousands more people to ride the t.  3.  Better Stations-- kiosks, smoothies, bars, convenience stores provide money making opportunities for the mbta, and a much better ride for the consumer.  Kill 2 birds with one stone.  4.  easiest fix of all..PLEASE cut the number of stops at BU in half.  SO unnecessary.

Yet you find it so damn difficult, whether via train or bus there's always something that comes up. It is so frustrating & makes it difficult to not be constantly annoyed due to these circumstances. So many other cities don't run into even a 1/4 of the problems you do. You think all these fare hikes are what's going to solve the T's money problems, it's not.

They also don't run this service on Friday nights.  Or any other night for that matter.  Which is just inconsistent and annoying.My favorite T story:  I was riding home from Central Square to Brookline and instead of taking my ordinary route (#1 bus) I took the red line to avoid the possibility of missing my transfer.  Luckily for me, the last C was waiting at Park St and I was like ""Yeahhh going homeee!""  Well, we got to Kenmore, they ejected everybody from the train, claimed ""out of service,"" and drove off.  Another T did not come for OVER AN HOUR.  Not another C, another T.  PERIOD.  If I were smart, I would have split the cab with a bunch of people going to Washington Square, but I was stubborn (I'd paid my fare, the T should take me home, why spend the extra $$?) so I ended up taking the B because it was the first train I saw and I didn't trust that there would be a C or D coming, and walked 30 minutes at 2AM from the B line to my house.  I didn't get home til 2:30AM and had checked my clock in Central Square at 12:15AM right before I left.  I could have walked home faster!  This was not the only time it took me two hours to get from point A to point B because of the T, but it was definitely the worst.  (And I must note that this does not count the amount of times my ""stop requests"" have been blatantly ignored or I've been left out in the cold with arms full of groceries/whatever because the bus / T has chosen not to stop at its stop, JUST missed a bus that does not show up for an additional HOUR, I've been late for school/work/everything because of unannounced and unpredicted detours or construction or shuttle buses, so on and so forth... the list goes on.)Ugh, just thinking about the time the T has stolen from my life!  It makes me hate the world.",mbta
363,1,"Dec 17, 2010",Truly lacks the wisdom that you would expect with such age. It seems that its administrators never bother to understand why their customer's think so little of the T. Their mapping system should be upgraded to one standard instead of the mix of horizontal (in-train) and vertical (in-station) orientations. They can't blame the tourists for being clueless when the system directories are so disorganized.The buses are another story: What's the point of having clocks on the bus when the operators often run early and late for no apparent reason?,mbta
366,2,"Dec 4, 2011","Like the extent of the coverage, but the user experience is lacking.  The green line trains that are super-slow and often late used to bother me, but lately, it has to do with the bus system.  Started over a year ago when my car was nearly squashed by a bus near the downtown Boston library- which was cutting across turning lanes, illegally.   Also followed by the driver flying me a big old bird.   My email to the MBTA went unanswered.Last week it was that I was waiting at the bus stop in plain view and the driver blew right by me.  Again, email feedback went unanswered.  If you want riders, the drivers need to stop and pick them up.",mbta
367,2,"Jul 17, 2014","I have used public transit in over 20 countries and this is one of the worst. Commuter rail is often late. So far there has only been one day in July (out of 17) where neither inbound or outbound train were late. It's too hot, too cold, signal problems, switch problems, conductor problems, engineer problems, something different every day.Commuter trains can only be boarded at certain doors. That's the most idiotic setup I've ever seen. It takes longer to exit and board a train at a busy station then with a Boeing 737. The doors are typically dependent on how many and where conductors are, so the passengers are left to guess. There is often a ""get to the open door"" stampede on the platform. Number of cars and configuration of cars changes day to day for the same train for no apparent reason.The only ""known good"" door is at the platforms which enable level entry. The platforms are Back Bay and South Stations are as far away from the station entrance as possible so everyone who actually needs the platform (disabled, strollers, heavy luggage) must walk the whole length of the platform. To make matters worse, the train often misses the platform, so the whole crowd needs to shuffle off the platform and climb in through the stairs anyway. The Trains technically have WIFI but it almost never works. Commuter trains have almost no signage and require ""insider knowledge"". There isn't a single sign anywhere at the Back Bay station platform. No schedule, no train indicator, no message board not even a clock. NOTHING. There only a bunch of bull horns that garble unintelligible messages. Apparently the first car after the engine is a ""quiet car"" but again there is absolutely no sign indicating that this is the case and what it actually means.Last week a friend of mine had to get to the airport and since it was during rush I recommended the train to South Station + Silver Line. Bad choice: there is no place to store even a regular sized carry on bag. The train had a problem a, stopped prematurely at Yawkey and all passengers got booted off with no help and/or further instructions on how to continue from there. My friend was lucky enough to find a friendly local to help him on his way but he didn't get on his flight anyway.It's not all bad though: the trains are clean and in reasonably good shape. Seating  is tight but workable, although sometimes the train is so full that there is only standing room. The conductors tend to be friendly and nice. It's also very expensive. My commute  of 22 miles one way costs ca. $21 round trip. 10 pass cost exactly 10 times as much.",mbta
368,2,"Apr 20, 2007","How can I complain about public transportation that saves me the hassle of driving in this town, saves me from spending my discretionary income on taxis (so affordable in Chicago, but not in Boston), and thus helps preserve our environment?  In my informal, unscientific study of the T, I find that 80% of the time I am *just* missing the C line.  So I take the D line instead, which seems to run more cars, which is great but some idiot conductor stops short at the Longwood stop.  This makes the second car run over the wooden boards that were laid between the tracks so us paying users can walk from one side to the other.  This usually happens when I'm on the wrong side of the track so I have to hurdle over the rails.  Thanks.  I also love this female conductor for screaming at me when I use the back doors to enter.  A) I just had to hurdle over the tracks thanks to your poor spacial judgment.  B) In all the years I've taken the D line, there is something called Show and Go! C) You don't have to be a raving banshee.  I'll swipe my frakkin' Charlie Card when I get it out of my bag.  I can't grab my lovely card AND hurdle at the same time.  That's just my morning commute.  The afternoon commute usually consists of just missing the C or E at North Station, and having to wait 15-20 minutes, sometimes 30 min. if there's something wrong with the tracks, etc.  Or I just about make it to the door, and wham, they slam it shut in your face.  Don't tell me that this never happened to you.  If it's not happening to me, I'm watching it happen to you.  It's like the conductors live to do this.",mbta

And $18 for 7 days.So when you stay for 2 or 3 days like i did you feel quite stupid.I have been using the subway in NYC for months and it is by far such a smarter and more efficient network. Boston should get inspired by it.Moreover you have to step a few stairs in norder to get from the platform to the subway floor. Another way to loose precious space in rush hours.Also for outdoor station you will have to queue so everyone can vadlidate its ticket at the SIngle machine near the driver. Just like in bus you will tellme, except that here, it is a mass transportztion vehicle.After loosing space, the mbta this is a good lesson on how loose time stupidly. It feel like you are riding the subway a few decades ago.Another important point, the govermznt center station. This station is closed and will be that way for 2 years. But no f***ing signs tell you that, neither on the platform or in the train.

374,2,"Dec 7, 2007","I was spoiled big time when I lived in Paris. While no public transit system is going to be 100% on time and without issues, the Metro definitely kicks the MBTA's inefficient ass all over the place.Unlike the Metro, the T doesn't have many access points. So, its difficult to live in a lot of areas in the city without having to walk 3 miles or resort to buying a car. If you are lucky enough to live near a station, that's great - but with all the weird 'technical difficulties' that the T seems to have on a daily basis, I sometimes wonder whether it would take me less time to walk from Cambridge to Downtown Boston. I'll be fair though - the Red Line isn't too bad. It holds a lot of  people, tends to show up more often than never, and is way faster than the pitiful Green Line. But you have to wonder what is going on when it suddenly stops dead in the middle of a tunnel for no apparent reason. Sometimes you'll get on a train with a driver who isn't half stoned, so they'll make an announcement to let you know what's up. That doesn't happen too often though. So, most of the time, you just sit there (or stand there) for what seems like an eternity, wondering if you'll ever see the light of day again.I have to say though...the reason why this review gets only two stars is because of the Green Line. Seriously, if I could give, like negative 10 stars, this is what I would give it to. The Green Line is slow, seems to show up randomly, and doesn't hold many passengers. You should see the chaos that ensues during the morning commute at Park Street. The young, spry Red Line keeps coming into the station, letting out loads of zombie-like commuters, who all trek right up to the Green Line platform. A lot of times, they will join the throng of other zombie-like commuters who are already there - still waiting for at least one..one single train to show up. Its amazing how long you can wait there...the minutes go by languidly, which makes the crowd swell even more. When a train finally rolls in, the stampede commences and nothing is safe any longer. At this point, come to terms with the fact that it will take you even longer to get to work, because now you have to wait for everyone to pack into the train, leave the station, and then go to the next station, where even more people will try to pack in (while others try to leave the train - a very difficult thing to do on such mornings.)Don't even get me started on the section of the Green Line where the train has to stop at intersections. Helloooo.....can we say BUS?! I thought that this was supposed to be a subway system?!Anyway, if you can, try to just take the Red Line - maybe forget about most of Boston entirely and just come and hang out in Cambridge. It's a great place to be - cute restaurants, bars, etc. Not only that, there is some chance that you might actually get there in time to meet up with your friends. If you insist on trekking a couple miles over the river though, make sure to give yourself like two hours to get there. With the Green Line as your mode of transport, you'll need it.",mbta

With parking in Boston so ridiculously expensive, $11-16 dollars a day, you have no choice but deal with there BS... which wouldn't be so bad, if they actually at least made it LOOK like they cared or are working out the kinks but they make it seem like pushing a button to make a train go and announcing a stop is sooo tiring.

I won't get into the MBTA workers, because I generally try to avoid them and understand that they are probably overworked and underpaid, but many people I know have issues with their attitude.Let me say that I have lived in the Boston area my whole life and have always used the train. I remember when you still had to use tokens, the service was good, it was easier sneak on, etc etc.The new T system is a complete scam. Machines don't accept pennies, give back Sacagaweas and eat money all the time. The validation machines are bogus because they put a time limit on your verification--since when does my money expire from trying to convenience others by not using the machine? Second, it has gotten to the point where you must plan your day around your transportation. You must schedule fifteen minutes of waiting time into your plans, plus, I don't think I'm exaggerating when I say up to 30 minutes from inconveniences such as broken switches and other BS we have to put up with.I also really love it when I see someone knocking on the door of a bus or train, begging the driver to open it for them and they keep going. Also when you ask to get off at a stop and they tell you that you have to press the request line--You have a control pad in front of you. Isn't that your job, asshole? This is absolutely unacceptable and ridiculous behavior and it is going unpunished. Lastly, if you're not going to run 24/7, there should not be this many glitches all the time. What are you doing for those hours that the T is closed, because from my experience, maintenance has taken place during the afternoon, rush hour and other times that really seem to stick it to the people.In short, I hope that someone posts the current president of the MBTA's phone number for the public so that we can all call him and tell him what a scam artist he is and what a terrible thing he is doing to our city.",mbta
379,1,"Mar 15, 2016","I wish that yelp would allow people to put a zero star review, because I would gladly do so. The MBTA is one of the most, if not the most, terribly organized and managed organization that I have ever seen. I really cannot comprehend how they are almost bankrupt, considering that they are running 20 year old buses, 35+ year old trains, pay their employees about 60k a year, and just raised the fare to $2.80. It is ridiculous. Another big issue is the safety of these trains; just a few weeks ago, TWO Orange Line trains began smoking, and people began to break windows and jump out to avoid suffocation. There has not been a single day, in my 3 years of riding the T, that there has not been a delay on one of the 4 subway/trolley lines. The old trains that they keep running (because they are ""out of money""), are always breaking down, and the stations are not well maintained. Remember those smoking trains I was talking about? Well, that was because a metal panel fell of the side of a train, and shorted out the third rail and the electronics in the train, causing it to smoke. Then, after the first train smoked out the station, it left, and nobody decided to turn off the third rail and remove the panel. I bet you can guess what happened next; yet ANOTHER train came into the station, and the train and third rail shorted out. The employees are lazy, over-payed, and think they are entitled, just because they are the ones getting you from point A to point B, even if that involves inhaling smoke for 5 minutes straight. Don't even get me started about the buses. Just today, the bus was supposed to leave Alewife Station (where the route begins) at 3:30, and it didn't come until 3:50. At around 3:32, two buses had ""79"" on the front of the bus, ready to take passengers. One of the two bus drivers changed his sign to say ""Out of Service"" and drove off. The other bus driver decided it would be a fine idea to just pull the bus over, turn it off, get out, and enjoy her coffee break.

People on the train said ""They're not actually going to kick us off right?""

An additional column indicating arrival time AND departure time would help eliminate confusion for travelers. Additionally, the staff had literally no desire to be helpful. We purchased one way tickets after being told the cost would be the same, but we're surprised to be charged an extra $9 for purchasing our tickets from downtown. What a serious disappointment considering the ride is $8.50 per person. The attendant rudely said it was said numerous times at the station...

391,1,"Aug 4, 2014","The MBTA is the worst public transportation system I have ever experienced. I have lived, spent significant time in or visited New York, D.C., San Francisco, Chicago, London, Paris, Madrid and Barcelona. Your trains are old and antiquated, worn out, leaky, rusted and loud just for starters. The fact is this is the only subway system that does not run trains at 2 minute intervals during rush hour. 7 - 10 minute splits results in overloaded trains, long lines and daily frustration. In London, trains run every minute at Oxford Circus, a major hub.  This is only city where I see people running to trains every day, pushing and shoving, being told repeatedly by frustrated drivers to clear the platform.  It is your poorly run system that causes bad behavior among riders.  Barcelona's trains are large, and fast. People can stand 4 across between the seats.  I went from Central Barcelona to the suburbs in under 25 minutes.  It takes 45 minutes to an hour to get to Downtown Crossing from Wellington, 5 miles, and I often have to wait for a second or third train. It's the same on the return trip.  This should be a 20 minute ride at worst.   It takes 17 minutes in New York from 137th to 59th on the One Line, 5.3 miles. The New York trains run according to schedule. I have no idea when MTBA trains run. It's different every day.  This system needs new trains in addition to new stations. More stations will just clog the system more.  Whoever is in charge of city planning is a moron.  A 15-year old using Sim City as a guide could design a more efficient system.  The Chamber of Commerce should stop attempting to portray Boston as a major city until it can transport its citizens like other true major cities.  BTW-The Green and Silver lines are trolleys, not subway trains. In San Diego, the trolley takes you from downtown to San Ysidro in 45 minutes.

Instead, the whole system,but especially the Green Line, Silver Line and Commuter Rail WREAK of a ""Is this really the best we can do?!"" stench. Let's talk briefly about these three biggest stinkers:a) Green LineA recent ""Trains Magazine"" article about modern streetcar systems in this country (July, 2014) didn't even mention the MBTA's Green Line because, guess what, no part of it is MODERN. So, you say, ""Fair enough--as America's first subway it has a lot of old charm,"" except that that's not the case EITHER. If you look at San Fran's or New Orleans's streetcar/trolley networks you get the old charm feeling--the Green Line just kind of EXISTS. It's not like the MBTA even TRIED to keep ANY of the charm either:*Wherease NYC Transit takes PRIDE in the original mosaic artwork and tiling at many underground stations, the T walled OVER them with bland white walls.*Park Street had the most charming, yes charming, green lampshades on the Green Line level--they replaced them with ugly ""office style"" fluorescent lighting.*The T does very little to hype the Mattapan ""High Speed"" Line, the Red Line's extension from Ashmont to Mattapan. This best-kept-secret utilizes the old PCC cars which also ran on the Green Line through the mid-1980s.b) Silver LineIf you looked up ""bustitution"" in the dictionary, next to it should be a picture of a Silver Line bus, for the Silver Line continues the MBTA's long tradition of convincing inner-city residents that replacing fast, truly ""rapid"" rail transit with an effing bus somehow makes things ""more"" efficient:*A-train, which split off from the B at Packard's Corner and ran to Watertown Square, scrapped for the 57 bus. *E-train semi-permanently truncated from Arborway/Forest Hills to Heath Street for the 39 bus. When the traffic is bad they short-turn the trains even further up the line at Brigham Circle. It's not like the 39 buses don't ALSO get stuck in traffic so why not offer people a one-seat-ride out of JP?*The Washington Street Elevated Orange Line was scrapped for the 49 bus, which became the Washington Street Silver Line. This was after years of promising some of the lowest-income residents in the City in Lower Roxbury that it would be a light rail line (trolley/streetcar) line. Numerous environmental and transit watchdog groups have derided the so-called ""Bus Rapid Transit"" Silver Line as being one of the worst such implementations of BRT in the WORLD!*Forget linking two major rapid transit lines, the Red and Blue--instead let's use what little money that came from the Big Dig that was earmarked for public transit to build a brand new tunnel for buses to run through it at 10 mph and change power mode halfway to the Airport.c) The Commuter Rail, a-k-a ""Purple Line."" Where. Do. I. Start? I've ranted and raved on numerous blogs, including my own about how, the Commuter Rail needs to start, yes start, to electrify. I've heard every excuse in the book; and I have an answer for them all:*What's the point?Electric trains are faster, quieter and much more environmentally-friendly. Back Bay Station in particular should be the SHAME of the entire system, with dozens of locomotives belching diesel into the station throughout the day.*Who's going to maintain the equipment since the MBTA facilities have no overhead wiring? Really? That's like 5th grade mentality. BUILD the facilities!Certainly $500 million could've gone a long way towards building electric maintenance bays, with enough change left over to start electrifying at least the Fairmount Line, rather than blow it on reopening the Greenbush Line--which wasn't even PROJECTED to bring in a decent passenger volume.*Where's the equipment going to come from?This speaks volumes about the MBTA's procurement process in general--why does the MBTA need brand new ANYTHING?! For the most cash-strapped public transit agency in the country, why not take ""certfied pre-owned"" equipment from Metro-North and NJ Transit, give it a mid-life overhaul and run it for another 20 years. SURELY that make more sense than running what you've got INTO THE GROUND, causing numerous delays and the infamous double-trains. Oh, wait, because the MBTA tries to compete with the Joneses and buy brand new cars all the while still using old, diesel-belching locomotives. You're right, MBTA, people want brand new, shiny cars--not locomotives that won't start or go but then stall out. I had to laugh when, with the orders for the new locomotives falling behind, the MBTA was forced to lease used-but-very-functional ones from MARC.

I've ridden every mode of the MBTA extensively except the Ferry--I'm not basing this review off of one bad ride on the ""B"" Line.#1 PUBLIC TRANSIT IS PUBLIC TRANSIT (IN THE U.S.A.)Public transit in the U.S. stinks. That's a fact. Metaphorically speaking it's a constant tug-of-war between Conservative-leaning politicians (and their constituents) who see little to no value in it other than ""another wasteful Government program to help the poor"" and Liberal-leaning politicians who see little to no value in it other than to pander to their constituents who value it for one or more of the following:*Environmentally-friendly*Sanity-saving over sitting in traffic (in a personal vehicle)*Avoiding exorbitant parking fees at their destination*Moving a car and losing a parking space (especially after a snowstorm)Thus, when Transit System X tries to make improvements, you get Conservative politicians who staunchly oppose as little as a $0.005 (yes 1/2-cent) tax increase to help cover it; and when the Liberal politicians push it through, only about 1/3 of if actually gets funneled toward improvements (the remainder goes to pay down various debt). Thus, the MBTA, like most other transit systems in this country, comes up broke every year, and every other year gets forced to raise fares even though raising fares doesn't account for even HALF of revenue stream. Sound familiar?#2 THE MBTA SQUANDERS WHAT LITTLE MONEY IT DOES HAVESo that little bit of money that comes from taxes and tax increases that actually DOES make it to the MBTA--where does it go?! I think what confounds me, and others who've lived in the Greater Boston Area long enough, is that the T is one of the LEAST expansionary systems in the country, and, what little money it did have for expansions in the last 20 years (after the Red Line Extensions to the North and South) got funneled into A. the Greenbush Commuter Rail Line, which nobody wanted and, even worse, created more congestion at an already-congested South Station,and B. the Silver Line, part of which was the greatest lie ever told in the City (should've been light rail vehicle service), and the rest of which only served to compete with bus service it was already providing to South Boston and transit service already being provided to the Airport (Logan Express).Meanwhile, beneficial projects have been pushed back numerous times or haven't even left the drawing board.*The Green Line Extension into Somerville/Medford was supposed to have been COMPLETED in 2008--no wait, 2014--no wait 2019 . . .*The Blue Line Extension to Lynn--still in ""proposal"" phase.*The Red Line-Blue Line Connector--still in ""nice to have"" phase.#3 CUSTOMER SERVICEThe bus and train operators certainly could take a chill pill: not only are they some of the highest paid people in the state without ever needing a college degree, their pay scale is WAY above that for most public transit employees in this COUNTRY--and that's even adjusted for cost-of-living! Add in being  part of the Carmen's Union--arguably one of the most iron-clad organizations since the Teamsters--and it certainly is a recipe for apathy towards the riding public.Part of the problem is that the MBTA relies almost solely on a lottery system (let's be honest, there's always some *hush hush* grandfathering-in--but we won't talk about that!) to hire bus and train operators. Sure, everyone gets a fair shot, but, wouldn't it be nice if SOME of the hiring was done of people who come from similar jobs who left in good standing?Let's say Bus Operator A  worked at Peter Pan/Trailways/Greyhound for ten years and got tired of the long, boring drives: Boston--NYC, Boston--Concord, NH, etc. Bus Operator A leaves with an exemplary record and is just looking for a change of scenery. That bus operator would be great for the MBTA! But, because of the lottery, Bus Operator A is competing with Pond Scum who dropped out of high school and just got his/her GED.  Sure, Pond Scum needs a job too--but, let's be real--there are people who take jobs because they even REMOTELY love what they're doing and there are people who take jobs because the Carmen's Union negotiated RIDICULOUSLY high salaries and generous pension plans for doing the same sit-in-traffic (cry me a river) job done by MILLIONS of people worldwide. You know what you wind up with when the  T hires Pond Scum? You wind up with the bus operator who took out a car trying to run down a ""meter maid"" because of her personal unpaid tickets.",mbta

Now the escalator inside the station between the 1st and 3d floor is out of service and has been for months.  Additionally one of the two elevators inside the station is out of order.  In MBTA terms this is a relatively new facility.  It is a disgrace that it is allowed to deteriorate.

Also the T loves buses over subway/streetcars.. there are so many grown over short train routes such as Lynn to Wellington via Saugus. This right of way would make a good bus rapid transit.. not the bus rapid transit on Washington st in South End to Dudley.. if that silver line was on a former train right of way, yes it would be good but not on the street.. insult to those people who once had the elevated train. In the 70's the T was all about orange/red expansion and now since they have taken the train system over from the private companys such as Boston and Maine they rather care about 100 train riders, bring back Bud cars to carry so few people.",mbta

After 30 minutes I had to get back to work. With nothing accomplished.The wait at the old windows (right next to the NEW Charlie Card Store) only took up to 10 minutes EVER in those lines.

399,1,"Nov 20, 2014","There is often something wrong with the train, there are usually delays of some sort. There is no expectation of any sort of consistent bus/train schedule. The 32 bus from Forest Hills station has been especially vexing. When I get there in the afternoon, there are lots of kids who just got out of school trying to get on the bus. It's always crowded, even if I wait for the next bus. Today, two empty buses passed right by. Others waiting have said they've complained to the MBTA, to no avail. The 32 seriously needs to run more frequently or start using double-decker buses because this is ridiculous. It is a waste of people's time. And in a city like Boston, public transportation is cheaper and is supposed to be more convenient than driving one's own car. The entire public transportation system needs to be more efficient. In addition, it needs to be easier to purchase Charlie cards that work. There are a limited number of retail locations where cards can be purchased.  Charlie tickets are easier to get, but the turnstiles don't read them well--or at all. The machine takes a Charlie ticket in and out several times trying to read it, and sometimes doesn't work even though there is a sufficient balance on it. You need to fix those machines. I could go on about how inefficient everything is, but I'm too tired. -One very dissatisfied customer.",mbta
400,3,"Sep 25, 2012","I wouldnt say the MBTA is really ""that"" bad.. instead, i think its okay. As long as i get to the places i need to go to. Although, the MBTA can be dirty at times and sometimes require a really long wait to get into a train, but overall, I think that as long as i get to the places i need to go to then i'm fine. There are air conditioning during the hot summers, which makes it somewhat more enjoyable when taking the mbta. However,  the fare increase lately so i'll think twice before taking the train again. Overall, i think we could use some new trains or at least a renovation here and there.",mbta
403,1,"Oct 1, 2014","I am forced to use the system to get to work and everywhere else I need. I have had times in the past where I will be going out to the bus stop (well before the time posted on the rider tool of MBTA website) and it will be driving away... OR I will wait for almost 10 minutes after the posted time until it finally decides to show up. TODAY though, I needed to get my rabbit to the vet, so I used the Ride Planning tool to figure out when I would grab the bus from my stop to get to where I was planning on taking a taxi from. Iit was scheduled to come at 1:16, so I headed out (in the pouring rain, mind you....with my rabbit in her carrier!) at 1:08, which i thought was more than early. I stood out, getting soaked, saw two THE RIDE busses pass me, and by the time it was 1:35, I was very upset. I decided that I would no longer make it on time for my appointment, I had just kept my little rabbit out in the rain and wind for longer than expected, and I ended up having to reschedule my whole appointment! I am not happy with the posted times vs actual pick-up times.... be it too early or too late. I KNOW they can't possibly be exact every time (wheelchair pickups, traffic, whatever) but this was outrageous! If you are going to pick people up ten minutes before the posted time, then change the time online so we know!

Just the other night, a driver shut the door in a woman's face and drove away.  This morning, the woman driving the bus sat at a stop for almost three minutes waiting for a passenger to find her wallet while others with passes waited patiently to get on the bus instead of getting everyone on and continuing on the route.

I was only in Boston for one day but it was less crowded during rush hour than it was in New York or DC at least. I will admit the trains themselves are complete trash.

418,3,"Jul 1, 2006","i've done some thinking about this and i finally decided to yelp my true feelings for the mbta. i've become carfree in 2006 (using zipcar, my bike, the T, and my feet to get around) so i've had to take mbta more often than i did before, to places i would've driven to before (i.e. to brighton or to the suburbs like waltham or newton from where i live in somerville). and yes, it totally is a mixed bag. shit is broken half the time, buses don't arrive, you're waiting for the T forever, the bullshit new ""an outbound train is now arriving"" announcement (uhm, try an actually useful system like the MUNI or BART ""a pittsburg/bay point train is arriving in 5 minutes..."" system), fare hikes, etc. BUT the fact of the matter is that i CAN get there from here. for instance, there's a bus that goes from cambridge to brighton so i can get where i need to go. yes, it only runs once an hour on the weekends, but there still is that option. same goes for the 'burbs...i was going to a friend's barbecue in waltham and there was a bus i could take - it didn't run that often but there still WAS a bus. get the picture? if you're willing to have patience and work with the system and allot yourself a LOT of time to get where you need to be, the mbta gets the job done. in some cities there just aren't buses or trains that go from point A to point B and the mbta system is expansive, if not reliable. the T is also randomly awesome sometimes - like when you're walking to the hynes stop and there's randomly a number 1 bus there, which you can take straight down mass ave to harvard square in half the time it would take you to go inbound on the green line and then outbound on the red. or the commuter rail, which you can ride with your subway pass within zone 1a. my boyfriend works in the north end and instead of having to deal with red to green (or orange) crap, he just takes the commuter rail one stop from porter to north station and his commute is cut down from an hour to like 15 minutes. a big beef i have with the system though is the whole bikes on Ts thing. i called the other day to inquire about what buses have bike racks on them since i wanted to bring my bike with me to where i was going, and the woman on the phone had no idea what i was talking about, and had to ask her supervisor..who then told me that the only buses that had racks were crosstown buses and those ""used to have them, like a couple years ago"". uh, hello?? shouldn't you be INCREASING the number of bike racks to reduce the number of cars on the road instead of DECREASING them? also, we desparately need the proposed ""urban ring"" to cut through all of the lines. going inbound just to have to go back outbound is damn stupid. it would cut down on a lot of the congestion on the green line (which is only really bearable during the summers when the college students aren't here).",mbta

I live in South Boston, so, the T from here can get me to another bus to where I may be going.I've only encountered 2 really disrespectful bus drivers in over 45 years.The last time was just a few weeks ago.  I was on Bus #73 from Harvard on Sunday, March 24, between 12 and 1 pm. It was my first time on that bus.  I had no idea that folks tap their Charlie cards upon exiting the bus.  I was the first one on the bus, so, I tapped mine when I got on.  After a few stops outside of Harvard, I noticed that people were just getting on and a few who got off, tapped getting off.  When I first got on, I asked the driver about a certain street just before Belmont and he said ""g'head, just sit down, g'head"".  So, I sat down and when I saw the street coming up, I rang to get off.  When I was getting off, I told the bus driver I didn't know that the passengers tapped their cards getting off, and, I had tapped mine getting on and he said ""Just get off, keep going, get off"".  I was the only passenger at that time.I still cannot get over his rudeness.  I thought maybe it was a bad day for him, but, it was really a bittersweet day for me for where I was headed and I just could not excuse him.  He was a jerk and later on, I remembered seeing him in action on another line where he humiliated a young man until the guy got off of the bus swearing...then, he threatened to call the police.  He antagonized the kid.   It was totally uncalled for.This and, another time are the only times that a bus driver was rude and condescending and sarcastic and surly and disrespectful and unkind for no reason whatsoever only that I didn't know that you paid getting off of the 73 bus.",mbta

That's if you can't use your monthly  commuter rail zone 8 pass do to suspended services for many days, then that's taking money for no reason, that's not right, if they don't refund your money for a cancelled or suspended service for many days, that really hurts and it isn't fair period.If companies think customers should come first that they serve. Then they should give you a refund for like a monthly pass , if you were not able to use the pass for many days due to bad wreather, suspended services, that's the way it should be, a refund is really important. Since the MBTA dosen't give out refunds due to distrupted cancelled services or suspended services for many days, then it's not customers come first period. No refunds anymore is really bad unfair customer service, when transit service is cancelled or suspended for many days, even if you have a monthly pass and can't  use it, that's not right at all, that's not fair period. It's like you paid for cancelled or suspended rides. They don't have to treat customers that way. What happend to?

I keep reading news articles about how the MBTA is becoming less and less responsible for keeping schedules, maintaining good customer relations and other basic functions that one would come to expect from public transit organizations.

7,4,"Feb 5, 2023",Bart in General is a great way to get around the Bay Area. With the introduction of Clipper on Apple Watch I no longer have to get my Wallet out in order to pay my fares. I simply double tap the side button on my watch and select Clipper. Wave my watch at the touch pad and the fare gates open. Makes it easy for travel.The bad is that there is a lot of people cheating the fare gate system. For example at Hayward BART when I exited in the handicap section of the station someone took advantage of the open gate and walked through. And at Bayfair when I used the elevator to enter the station because I don't fare well on some escalators someone took advantage of the open gate and left the station without paying. So BART is really not enforcing these fare cheaters while the fares continue to increase gradually. The attendants at the stations seem to not care. The only way the crackdowns happen is when actual BART police is at the station.When I visited San Diego and used the Trolley Service there were active fare inspectors on every ride I was on to make sure people paid and if they did not have a valid fare they had to vacate the paid area. Bart could learn a lot from them if they invested in active fare inspectors.,bart

In light of this troubling attitude, I am willing to help BART appeal to this potential client base by putting a positive spin on a few of the less initially... attractive aspects of their service I encountered during a recent trip. Now, was the interior of the train covered with a wide variety of debris, including (but not limited to) socks, hypodermic needles, and a half-eaten chapstick? Yes, but this can easily be reframed. Rather than advertising their trains as ""filthy,"" BART can say that each car is ""a mobile community art project, filled with emotion and creative urban collaging.""Did the car smell like it housed twenty-five feral cats suffering simultaneously from rabies, mange, and food poisoning? Yes, but this can be repackaged as ""bringing the sights and smells of San Francisco with you as you go."" Were half of the seat cushions inexplicably ripped off their chairs, leaving rusty springs exposed? Sure - ""Each car has been redecorated in its own original way to keep with the changing times.""

10,3,"Nov 18, 2022","I judge a city's public transportation chiefly on whether it gets me where I need to go. I can't say that's the case for BART, or frankly, any means of transit that doesn't operate 24/7. People need to travel after midnight, whether they're out on the town or headed to/from work. When that isn't an option, it creates problems. For me, this meant a difficult time getting from my hotel to the airport. For others, I'm sure they're more significant & can't always be solved by calling a cab.Trains aren't well maintained or especially secure, often with garbage & unhoused &/or mentally unstable types making riders feel unsafe.",bart
11,1,"Jul 29, 2023","As a visitor, I found Bart a combination of confusing, broken, and expensive. The transit card purchased at the airport doesn't work elsewhere, which is not communicated anywhere. The card dispensing machines are mostly broken but not labeled as such. Our visa credit cards didn't work. We could only purchase 5 cards on our ATM cards but have a party of 6. There are so many modes that I cannot navigate how to get around. The clipper app requires that I provide my phone number and address. Why is they needed to ride a bus? What an unnecessary intrusion. I won't use it.I've travelled a lot, and this was a relatively stressful and difficult transit experience.",bart

This BART station  is homeless central...dirty, crazy homeless people on drugs. Not all entrances has escalators, be prepared to go up or down lots of stairs. The signage was not working so could not determine which train was approaching. Fares prices keep going up, yet the cars are filthy and not sanitized.  Some of the cars are 40 years old.

It can take up to an hour from Berkeley to downtown San Francisco, so you have to plan accordingly.  With all the people riding BART, it makes no sense why there are no direct routes.  Trains are dirty, smells like urine.  Most times, even on weekends, there are no seats available.  However expensive this system is, people take BART because they are the only convenient public transportation available from the East Bay.",bart
17,4,"Jan 24, 2023","I braved BART today! Not bad! I was preparing to take pictures to add to my friends ""Bart Angst"" file.... But to my relief... I found none. I rode a long way from Ashby to SFO during morning rush so there were a lot of opportunities. I had a seat! The car didn't smell bad...nor good. There were no delays! And people filed on and off without any riffraff.BART deserves a better rap... And it needs new seats with wipe-able, indestructible, recycled plastic fabric!And it needs the ironed on gum and detritus   scraped off the floor! And a good window cleaning! Would be a 5 Star true mass transit for all! Hey... Maybe the decommissioned old cars could be used as free health clinics on Bart grounds and  homes for those in need too? Just saying... Let's BART again!",bart
18,1,"Jul 10, 2023","BART is one of the worst transit systems.  All the reviews about dirtiness, out dated cars, riders jumping the fare gates not paying are all true and the sad part of it all is that BART does not really care what the condition of their transit system is.  First the cleanliness of stations and trains -- People who clean stations and train cars are mostly part-time employees that BART does not budget for, so they spend a bunch of money hiring part-time employees who may stay for 90 days or less so you never have a steady amount of cleaning personnel.  Plus the way they clean is disgusting.  The mop that is used to clean the floor is the same mop used to clean the escalator handles.  Lastly, the elevators staying clean is the responsibility of the patrons to advise the station agent of the dirtiness so a janitor can clean it.  Actual signs are posted in the elevator alerting riders of this.Out Date Cars -- The cars are out dated, but don't worry they have those fancy new cars, but unfortunately, by the time all of those cars are on the rails the technology will be out dated.  The same technology BART thinks is so amazing on their new cars has been on cars in the NY subway system for years before BART rolled out the ""Fleet of the Future""....only question is at what point in the future?Checking Fares -- BART spent a bunch of money on individuals to check passengers to see if they paid their fare.  The only problem the amount they hired in comparison to the number of trains that are on during any part of the day resulting in this to be a useless program.  If they were serious about the fare issue they could have a conductor like trains such as Amtrak such have that go through the car and check tickets.  This one individual, or at least two individuals could easily go through the entire train for an entire shift checking fare payment.  Problem solved.Internal Culture -- The culture inside the organization promotes individuals who have no qualifications to be in positions they are in, or set qualifications that will exclude well qualified people from applying.  Sadly, some individuals are so arrogant in the organization is that they actually tell people who work under them that there is no reason for them to apply for a position because I am going to get it.  They call this professionalism...hardly.Overall, BART is not a good resource to use either as a tourist or a commuter.  As one reviewer said you are better off getting a rental car.",bart

New trains provide more support for standing -- less seating, but it's a reasonable compromise. Seats are better. Sound filtering is better than before.

Half the riders hop on free and no one cares.7. Employees don't get paid enough to care.8. BART police are unseen, sit back, wait for something to happen, and respond later. 9. Security cameras... do they even work? 10. It is dated.  Everything from the old train cars to the robotic announcements need an upgrade.

In San Francisco, the BART (and MUNI) seems cleaner and safter and more efficient.The prices seem a tad high to go to places like Fremont where it's like $7 each way or $14 round trip, but I guess you save on gas, bridge toll and time (not being in traffic).It's a fairly easy system to use and is self explanatory for newbies and out of town tourists visiting SF.I'd not say it's the best system nor luxurious, but does the job well I think.",bart

67,1,"Dec 26, 2021","We've been away from the Bay Area for two years. Before we left, I would have said that BART was a substandard subway system that was an embarrassment to the large and affluent Bay Area, primarily due to its limited schedule (it closes every night), its infrequent trains (with many lines only running every twenty minutes), its somewhat high prices (especially for longer trips or just crossing the Bay), and its overcrowded trains (especially during rush hour). I've ridden a number of other public transit systems in large, metropolitan areas, and BART is bottom of the barrel. But it used to be relatively safe and functional (though I was finding delays growing increasingly common at the time we abandoned the Bay Area, which I don't know if that's still the case or not today).Two years later, by which I mean two COVID years later, BART has become a horrific cesspool. Taking a long ride, from the south end of the line (in San Jose) to the northeasternmost stop in Oakland we encountered:(1) At least half-a-dozen homeless people, a number of them looking mentally impaired in some way. At least one of them wearing no shoes. This is an escalation of a problem a few years ago, when BART stopped policing homeless people from getting on trains and riding them as far as they wanted. They were often dangerously aggressive, sometimes dangerously sick, and rarely pleasant. A few years ago, I'd often see one in any car I was on for more than a few stops. Now, as I said, it was a half-dozen on a fairly long trip.(2) At least half-a-dozen people either not wearing masks or wearing masks that did nothing to cover their mouth or chin. It was the three or four that just didn't even bother at all that shocking me the most: that they were ever allowed on the trains in the first place.(3) One young man absolutely screaming into his phone the whole time he was on the train. He was also unmasked and so covering the end of the train (fortunately, away from me) in spittle.(4) Another man getting on the train, starting to scream at another passenger, literally chasing him through the train car, and then as he returned to his seat saying how he was going to kill a white guy some day. He was unmasked too, as was the white guy he chased through the car (but did not kill).Traveling with my luggage, feeling vulnerable as a result, and definitely feeling vulnerable about COVID with the omnicron variant cutting through the population, this was all around a pretty horrific experience. And I'm an experienced BART rider from my previous decades in the Bay Area, not some country mouse. I'm not convinced BART should be running if this level of (non) safety is all they can provide.",bart

70,5,"May 10, 2017","I have a fairly light carbon footprint. I think probably the greatest thing one can do when living a green lifestyle is to be vegan & consume a plant based diet. After that transport plays a big factor. I have been car-free now for 13 years. I have been living in the Bay Area now for just over a year & take BART into San Francisco from Oakland at least thrice a week if not more for work. It is a reliable form of transport to commute into the city from the town. I also love using BART to go into Berkeley & other parts of the Bay Area. Much of this time of living car-free I have primarily been a bicycle commuter. It has helped living in some of the best bicycle commuter friendly places in the nation such as Portland, Boulder, & Eugene. Since moving to the Bay Area I primarily commute by BART along w/ walking.I last owned a car when living in Los Angeles. Los Angeles is quite car centric & was built w/ the car in mind. It was built around the freeway. After living there a year back in the day & having to content w/ gridlock bumper to bumper traffic on the freeway I was happy to finally give up owning a car all together. Besides living a green lifestyle & helping the environment being car-free is also far less costly than owning a car. Think about insurance, upkeep, gasoline, parking, & more. Sure being car-free isn't for everyone. Some people need a car when living in the suburbs or in rural parts yet being car-free works for me. I can understand people w/ kids might also depend on a car for day to day life. Living in the city car-free works for me & is a lifestyle I enjoy living!For cities in the United States the Bay Area is often ranked second in best public transport trailing behind NYC. I was born in NYC & had my first job there when I was 15. While in NYC my preferred mode of transport was walking & taking the trains. I much prefer BART over the bus systems here as there is something about travel by train that is nice. While NYC might have a more efficient & less costly subway system the Bay Area has a better climate. There is no snow or ice to content w/ in the winter. The summers aren't hot & humid like NYC.The BART isn't a perfect system though & does have it's shadow side. Perhaps Sat & Sun could be as efficient as M-F & ditto for holidays. There is sometimes delays, sometimes construction, sometimes escalators are out of service. There isn't one set price like in NYC as rides cost by how far you travel.Still all in all having a Clipper card is the way to go & you can always top it up as you need. Sure it might get crowded at times & you might have to stand yet this is nothing compared to taking the Metro train in New Delhi, India where commuters are packed like Dolmas in a tin. All in all I love BART. Having entertainment on the train on occasion such as breakdancers or people busking performing live music at times is part of the fun like NYC subways in the day.",bart

OK, I'm basing this on ONE experience, but it's enough for me to think, ""Never again!""The afternoon of July 1st, my partner and I flew into SFO, and being from Vancouver, we don't have ride sharing, so getting an Uber or Lyft from the airport wasn't a possibility (I've since signed up for a Lyft account and downloaded the app), and a cab would have been horrendously expensive, so we decided to take BART, an unwise decision.  First, there weren't enough BART ticket machines at the airport, despite there being more than enough space to install more, so there was a long lineup to purchase tickets.  Second, not all machines took cash, so we had to pay with our credit cards, thus paying high foreign currency exchange rates.  Third, there was no information on how much our ticket would be, but we didn't have the option of purchasing a ticket for less than $20 anyway (which, in Canadian dollars, with the credit card exchange rate, came to $27).And the trip itself was an absolute nightmare.  The trains were dirty and disgusting, and uncomfortably crowded.  Coming from the airport, we had a large suitcase, two bags, and a knapsack, so trying to exit the train was very difficult.  And as I was trying to make my way to the door, I accidentally brushed against a woman who made no effort to let people pass, despite saying, ""Excuse me"", and she flipped the fuck out on me. Yeah, pleasant ride. The price of our ticket turned out to be outrageous -- nearly $11!  Because we were two people, that's over $20 in transit fare, and because we each had to purchase a BART card with $20 on it, we actually paid $40 (or $54 Canadian with the extra currency exchange fee).  At that price, I would have preferred to pay extra for the comfort of a cab.  After all that, we now had two useless BART passes with over $20 worth of fare on them, which we were never going to use again because we were so disgusted with the experience.  (Thankfully we were able to give our cards to our friends, who use the BART.) There are some cities in which you can take transit from the airport, but like Berlin, San Francisco is not one of them.  This has been one of the worst airport transit trips I've taken, even worse than when I got punched in the face on the metro in Prague!  Getting punched in the face is better than taking BART from the airport.  And cheaper.[Yelp collections: West Coast 2018; Planes, Trains, and Automobiles]",bart
76,4,"Jul 1, 2016","For my 50th review, I have been thinking which business establishment should I do for this milestone of mine. And my 50th review coincided with my holiday in San Francisco, one of my fave cities outside of LA. I'm writing this while on board the BART train from Concord to Daly City. So my 50th review is now dedicated to none other than....BART! I can't think of anything more fitting.Just like the metro rail system in Chicago, I love taking this train going around NorCal. It's so convenient to just hop in to go from one place to another. The coaches are clean, air conditioned, not stinky and passengers are well behaved (based on my personal experiences). It's always on time and every station is well maintained as well. The price for one way at $6.30 is not bad at all considering how far you can go on a single trip. There's also daily and mostly pass options available based on your need. Seniors and students can also avail of discounted passes at $2.35 one way. The only thing that annoys me is not the actual train system itself, but some passengers who don't observe the big sign that says priority seating for seniors and persons with disabilities. It annoys me to see why people who deserves the seat are the ones standing up. Today, I have to give up my seat to a mom who has a little girl with her because no one is willing to. A simple kind of kindness won't hurt you people. And one more thing BART, as much as I love you, please keep the restrooms cleaner.",bart

80,3,"Dec 19, 2019","BART, or Bay Area Rapid Transit, began operations in the early 70s and almost seemed visionary, with its then modern '70s stations, free landscaped parking lots, turnstiles that went ""woosh"" in response to your magnetic strip fare card, Jetsonian looking rail cars, and smooth riding upholstered train cars with carpeting.  For many who live and lived in the Bay Area, it made everyday life a lot more convenient and commutes more feasible.  For out of towners, it made visiting the Bay Area more of a treat than it already was.BART is not perfect and so, on my last review, it got 4 stars.  Finally, BART has reached SFO ... for quite a while, actually.  It also has a people mover spur in the East Bay that can connect you to Oakland Airport (OAK) from the lines running up and down the east side of the bay.  Furthermore, BART has made some notable eastward expansions in the East Bay, out beyond San Ramon and Antioch (on 2 different lines).  They are also extending southward toward San Jose with the opening of the Warm Springs station, complete with all the new transit oriented development it has spurred, all set within sight of those typical oak studded brown hillsides of much of California.However, I feel that BART has slipped in many ways.  The first noticeable thing is how unkempt the rolling stock and many stations have become.  Now, instead of sampling a happier cross section of Bay Area denizens, you get to sample the more divided populace of the area, as in the haves and have nots.  In some cases, the theatrics in stations, at their entrances, and aboard the trains can go a little over the top.  While the Bay Area seems to be at the forefront of legislating and embracing so much special snowflake political correctness, you can't hold unhappy and unwell people to that yardstick.   I did get a quick look at some new rolling stock, which doesn't appear to have the trademark slanted back vehicle at its ends, as it was traveling on another track and it is much needed.  It's about time.Ticket prices are high, as are the prices for subway and train tickets in comparably priced New York City.  Each ticket price is dictated by the station pair, be it SFO to Oakland City Center or Richmond to Warm Springs.  Monthly travelers have some sort of loaded card that comes with integrated fare discounts, but point to point fares are still high.  Fares originating or ending at an airport must have a surcharge in them because they are much higher than if you began that same trip just one station away, and not in an airport.  However, it is much cheaper than taking a taxi or Uber/Lyft and much more ""direct"" than taking one of the big buses or coaches, such as SamTrans, to the airport.  With that said, BART does not have any sort of unlimited 1 day, 3 day, or weekly pass while the transit systems of many expensive U.S. cities do - I'm talking Los Angeles, Chicago, Miami, and Boston, to name a few.  Visitors to the area who want to be civic minded and use the system extensively get soaked in the process.BART is approaching 50 years of service and, while the more recently expanded segments of the service area aren't as worn, the original segments are starting to show a good deal of wear and tear.  I'm sure the overhead of running such a system, which was way ahead of any such system elsewhere in California, must be daunting.  However, with its inflows of funds, BART needs to keep the stations and trains cleaner and safer for what you pay.  But, it's to be expected.  Like most things in the Bay Area, they are never priced with much correlation to the value you receive.  BART may have 4 letters and once really merited its 4 stars.  However, it now just sort of ekes out 3 stars.  For those who give BART 1 star, and some of the experiences they describe point to why they are doing so, how would you feel about not having it at all?  And, since BART is behind the 8 ball in so many ways, I sort of feel that, even without penciling it out, those who oversee the system know they have a captive audience and could do better.",bart
81,4,"Apr 29, 2013","BART was the coolest thing under the sun when it was newish.  BART = Bay Area Rapid Transit.  As kids, we used to ask each other what the Fresno area would call their system if they got rapid transit.  Hardy har-har.  Kids.BART made all the sense in the world.  The Bay Area very badly needed an alternative to connect riders from its East Bay counties of Alameda and Contra Costa to the city of San Francisco across the vast bay.  When newer, the trains were sleek and cool, but now look dated and scuffed up.  The front of the cars were raked back, unlike the traditional subway cars seen in New York or Chicago.  The interiors featured both cloth seats and carpeting. The stations were modern and the whooshing sound of your ticket going through the turnstile was kind of cool.Pros:  A sensible layout that has continued to serve more communities in the East Bay, it now goes into airport at SFO, there are plans to go into the South Bay (but only along the East Bay), a nice smooth comfortable ride and ideal climate control, and the harmless quirkiness of the Bay Area on display (and the stories that go with that).Cons:  expensive - a ride from some far flung location such as Pittsburg/Bay Point or Pleasanton into the San Francisco airport is $$$, it doesn't hug the side of the Oakland airport and auxiliary transit is needed to get into OAK, some trains need to be cleaned up, the South Bay extension won't go all the way into San Jose and it should, and most of all, the idiocy of San Mateo County is legendary - they didn't want it THEN so it doesn't go down toward San Jose on the Peninsula side of the bay.  Wouldn't BART have been WAY better than Caltrain, with its at-grade configuration and limited hours?If the South Bay extension along the East Bay and a theoretical San Mateo/Peninsula line existed, and both met at San Jose, and cars and stations were slightly modernized, BART would be perfect.Also, there is no cost-benefit to crossing over north into Marin County, since the population base is low and most people who live there have enough money to wipe their asses with, as in ""What, moi on a subway car?""Even if you are a tourist, a BART ride is cool.

On a couple of occasions I left and took UBER because things were too crazy.

84,3,"Feb 22, 2016","When it comes to public transportation, I think BART is fine. It's functional, in many cases practical, and it gets you from Point A to Point B safely, affordably, and reliably. Sure, some of the stations aren't clean, the trains and buses can stink, and you have to deal with other people (the horror), but it's not any different from most other public transit systems around the world.BART's fare structure is different and more expensive than other public transit systems I'm familiar with in the U.S. Specifically, I'm talking about New York's MTA (Metropolitan Transportation Authority) and Atlanta's MARTA (Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority). Both MTA and MARTA charge a single flat rate per ride, $2.75 for MTA and $2.50 for MARTA. BART, on the other hand, charges based on distance. Instead of paying a simple, cheap, flat rate, BART riders have to calculate in advance how much their ride is going to cost.There are a couple ways I've calculated my BART fare:1. Use the fare calculator on BART's web site at https://www.bart.gov/tickets/calculator. Just enter your origin station and destination station and the web site will tell you how much the ride will cost.2. Use the fare schedule inside the train station. It's a large matrix of fares. Just match your origin station to your destination station to find your fare.A one-way ride on BART can cost as little as $1.95 (e.g. Montgomery St to Embarcadero) to as much as $12.05 (e.g. San Francisco International Airport to Pittsburgh/Bay Point). Yeah, it can get relatively expensive, but you're bypassing all the traffic in San Francisco, the Bay Bridge, and the East Bay, not to mention saving on gas money and tolls.Unlike other public transit systems, there is no charge to purchase a BART ticket. All you need to pay is your fare and the ticket kiosk will spit out a BART ticket with the amount you paid on it. For simplicity, I recommend using your credit card to purchase your BART ticket. Once you've swiped your credit card, you can add or subtract money onto your ticket in increments as little as $0.05. BART fares always end in multiples of $0.05, so be sure to add the correct amounts to your BART tickets so you never waste any money. (The New York MTA has collected over $500 million in unspent balances. http://www.yelp.com/biz/metropolitan-transportation-authority-new-york-4?hrid=QYfJhmXo1eViCW6Ahl9tYw)BART trains and buses see a lot of ridership and for good reason - gas is expensive in the Bay Area, traffic can really suck (especially on/around the Bay Bridge during rush hour), and parking in San Francisco can be expensive and/or difficult to find. The trains are worn and smelly, even the refurbished ones with the ""new"" vinyl-covered seats. At least they got rid of the cloth seats which were easier to stain, harder to clean, and retained odors for longer periods of time. I think they should convert all seating to a curved, easy-to-clean, hard surface.The trains and stations can get absolutely packed during rush hour. I've been on my fair share of rides across the bay during rush hour in both directions. Once, I took BART from the airport to Montgomery St station on a Monday evening at the peak of rush hour. There were so many people inside Montgomery St station, lined up for trains or entering/exiting trains, that it was basically impossible for me to physically get out of the station tugging my carry-on roller bag behind me. I had to lift the bag and hold it in front of me to squeeze by everyone, from the train platform all the way up the steps. It wasn't a big deal, but certainly an annoyance. So just be aware of that. In those instances, some people may find a more comfortable private ride (e.g. taxi, limousine or shuttle service, Uber, Lyft) worth it.",bart

Man, am I glad I got my own car and no longer have to ride the BART.And how the hell did the Berkeley Bart construction project take like 4-5 years??? Is there any accountability? What a waste of taxpayer money. I came to the bay in 2011 doe-eyed and full of optimism when I saw ads all over saying that Bart would be expand into the South Bay. It's now 2020, and I would be surprised if Bart made any more progress beyond Warm Springs before I died. Everyone needs to be fired and the bureaucracy needs to be trimmed down.",bart

The deeper into San Francisco or Oakland your origin point, the more assaulting the approach. The stench is a flesh-melting mixture of dirt, mechanical oils, rotting food and bodily fluids, with just a hint of musk (likely from bodies packed together like sardines during rush hour). If this effluvium isn't enough to curdle the contents of your stomach (one reason I ride before meals), a riling game of ""Bop-It!"" with a tired ticket machine should do the trick!Good luck navigating the droning prompts on this monochromatic would-be slot machine, whose buttons are permanently caked with a mysteriously sticky film. The machine trills and chirps at you loudly with each button press, inching towards your desired ticket-amount in nickel increments only to spit out chunks of loose change in a guttural rattle, no matter the denomination you sunk into her hungry cash receiver. When you finally get your ticket  -a flimsy, magnetized piece of paper- you waddle over to the turnstiles, heavy from the change weighing down your swollen pockets. You wait in line for your turn to play Operation with the mechanized ticket receiver which, if you're lucky, will carry your precarious paper ticket through her internal levers and spit it out at the other end, admitting you into the station.  **DON'T FORGET YOUR TICKET**If you forget to grab your ticket, an exciting conversation with a slate-faced station agent to explain the lost ticket awaits. A conversation that will make a Pap-Smear or colonoscopy seem pleasant by comparison. When you reach the platform, your train has been characteristically delayed by some accident or malfunction. As your mind wanders, you fight back the ever-looming fear of getting trapped at the base of the trans-bay tube. You're saved when your train grinds into the station with a ground-shaking rumble, trailing a putrid gust of wind that thrashes your face. The train lets out a series of thunderous bellows (think fog horn meets elk's mating call) warning you off the neon yellow braille mats lining the platform, away from pulverizing train wheels and the much feared electric third rail. As her doors open, a wave of angry pedestrians trample towards you with straight, angry faces as the train operator rushes a garbled directive through the P.A. system. A new mixture of smells and sounds assault your senses as you weave your way onto the cacophonous car.  You brush past a sweaty vagrant, an over-cologned businessman, a morbidly obese woman eating yesterday's fish sandwich, a hooded figure cursing obscenities at the air, a group of loud teens swilling concealed alcohol from a soda bottle. You press yourself between two seemingly-innocuous riders to grip a grease-streaked steel bar for support and settle into the zesty toilet-bowl aroma.  For the duration of your ride, the train churns and screeches through the bowels of the city, snaking its way between dirty, halogen-lit station after station as you struggle to avoid direct eye contact. At last, you are belched out of the car at your final destination, paraded up the stairs by the anonymous mob of fellow-riders and set free.",bart

97,1,"May 11, 2019","I just used BART to get from the San Francisco airport to downtown San Francisco in the beginning of May 2019. BART is the WORST form of public transit I've ever taken. It's even worse than the bus and I hate buses. (I've taken the London Underground, Paris Metro, Beijing Subway, Washington DC Metro and they are all very easy to use and well run subway systems. And their cars don't screech.)When you ride on BART, you really need earplugs. The metal wheels and the tracks are obviously installed incorrectly and the sound inside the BART cars make an extremely loud screeching sound for the entire ride. This is wrong and all politicians and BART management should be ashamed of themselves. In fact, new politicians should be voted in to make the BART system a good subway system. Shame on all people who purchased the BART transit system and shame on all the politicians who are doing nothing to repair or replace the entire BART rail system with good mass transit rails and cars. All of the BART cars are old and disgusting looking. The seat covers are old and disgusting as well.I was in Beijing, China in 2010 and rode their underground mass transit system. It was extremely easy to figure out how to get from Point A to Point B. I know ZERO Chinese. The subway stations were beautiful, clean, and set up to help move a huge amount of people with ease and with the least amount of walking, from the street to the boarding point for the subway cars. The subway stations are extremely clean and welcoming for passengers. The subway doors are evenly spaced and throughout the entire car so it's easy and fast for lots of people to exit and enter each car. The subway cars are very fast and quiet. Inside each subway car, above each and every door, is a lighted map showing each stop. Plus the lighted signage shows which stops the subway cars have already stopped and which stops the subway car is going to. The subway lighted map system (inside the car and above EVERY door) has both Chinese characters and English underneath each stop, to make it easy to know where you want to get off the subway. San Francisco politicians and transit system people need to:1) Ride the BART system and ruin your ears and be ashamed of the transit system you have and then...2) Take a trip  go to Beijing, China and see how a real city runs a very clean, extremely fast, quiet, and easy to use subway system. 3) Then these politicians and transit management types should be tried for being incompetent, corrupt and lazy, and have them serve prison time. 4) New politicians need to be voted in and new transit management put in place, go to Beijing, learn from the Chinese. 5) Then have these competent management oversee a complete revamping of the BART system with new rails, new subway cars, renovate all subway stations including re-engineering the subway stations with too long of a walking distance from street to the subway car. New and easy to read and understand signage needs to be in all subway stations and inside all the subway cars. And for goodness sake, add the subway car name to the outside of the sides of all the subway cars, so when they arrive at a station, it's easy to confirm that that exact subway car is the one passengers want to take, and so that the signage on the outside of the subway car will match the boarding area signage on the inside of the subway station.And make sure that the new subway cars have lighted signage (a lighted map with all the stops for that subway line) inside and above each subway door (like they have in Beijing, China) to make it extremely easy for passengers to know when to leave the subway car.And the new subway cars should have evenly spaced out doors to allow easy access for people during rush hours. And if you are really clever, you'd have a permanent wall between the subway tracks and the boarding area in the subway station so people can't fall or jump in front of a subway car, like they have in Beijing, China. San Francisco, ever heard of safety first?6) Don't allow the homeless to reside in the subway stations. Have security guards at the entrance of every BART station and don't allow the homeless inside. Locals and travelers don't want to see homeless people sitting and begging them for money, don't want to hear the homeless yelling and screaming, smell the rancid orders from these homeless and don't want accosted by the homeless.",bart

Now, the trains have a lot of issues and it's pretty often. In the winter time you're often likely to get on a train with its air conditioning on (which I don't mind as I love cold weather), but in the devils heat you are also likely to board a train with the heat on which is sickening. Whether it's a ""Medical"" emergency, police activity, or just some unknown delay...it happens a lot. The trains are pretty clean for the most part, but the employees can come across as unhappy and treat everyone the same. A paying passenger doesn't often look like a homeless person begging or trying to ride for free, but some Bart employees act like you simply don't matter whether you are polite or not.     I will share one of my experiences with a sad Bart agent...the clipper card was recently introduced and the Bart system was not fully prepared for clipper. My clipper card did not work at several of the gates so instead of holding up other passengers I went to ""See Agent"" as the machine instructed. I politely told the agent good morning and explained that I tried to use my clipper card and it would not work...the agent came out stating ""you just want me to work today..."" was serious and not joking with me. They got it to work after running it across the reader MANY times, and told me I just have to do it right next time. I thanked them kindly and went to work.    I have family that works for Bart and have gotten assistance with a smile from many Bart employees so they definitely deserve stars.Everyone knows Bart as a whole is a great asset to the Bay Area in general, but Bart can do better.",bart

We went under a water tunnel and it literally popped my ears which hurt a little. I did not enjoy that. It did not seem to affect the normal people who ride the BART on a daily basis. The ride was fairly smooth and it got to our destination pretty fast. My husband bought prepaid cards for the BART. We just wave them in front of the scanner and it let us in and out. I think my husband loaded around $40 in the card which should be enough to get us back to the SF airport when we leave from our visit in Dublin. I do like how friendly the attendant was at the 12th St and Oakland stop. She helped me swipe my card on the machine because it was not working. She was very helpful. There were some strange characters on the BART as with any public transportation. I saw a guy haul in a shopping cart in the BART which was funny.

It really as of yet does not have much of a footprint in the South Bay, though one line does extend to San Francisco International Airport (SFO) and another line terminates at Millbrae.THE SETUPMass Transit will always have it's issues.  It's a total crapshoot whether one bases transit on:* ""TIME"" - as Sacramento does with it's Light-Rail and Buses - you purchase the pass/ticket and you have a 2 HR window to travel within; or on, * ""DISTANCE"" - as BART does when calculating how much to deduct from the ticket as you exit from a particular station.BENEFITS I find it is much cheaper and less stressful to hit the rails (Amtrak AND BART) than deal with gas, the tolls, the traffic commute anxiety, law enforcement, wasted time, etc. etc., especially if I can leave Sacramento in the middle of the afternoon, do my thang in SF/Oakland, and return to Sacramento before Midnight / 1AM - then it's totally worth it to travel down Amtrak and catch BART.ENTERTAINMENT!And once in a while, you even get to see some impromptu shows by the local dudes who have their music and magic dance moves to keep people like me entertained.https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bart-oakland-2?select_video=d9J7e2uo-a0S0XMuw1CS-ATHE LOWDOWNIt certainly pays to travel by mass transit on some occasions.",bart

I am currently on a platform in San Francisco at 9pm, and they just closed 1 of the only 2 tracks in and out of the station. 1 track for 4 different train lines.  Their incompetence is on a level that is criminal. As I have repeatedly said in the past BART must be sued at a class action level.",bart
109,1,"Sep 28, 2016","A month after my previous review, no improvement whatsoever was made. Severe delays were experienced on average 5 days out of 5 on every work week. They are so poorly organised trains going to the exact same destination show up at the same station at exactly the same time! An issue you would think would affect buses more than trains, but BART manages the impossible. And not only do they not improve, they get increasingly worse when it comes to reliability. Trains get later and later throughout the week until they're showing up 5 minutes late, not including delays you will encounter further down the line. In most countries 30 seconds late is considered unacceptable but for BART, you should just be grateful BART employees bothered to show up for work, albeit in their unwashed and unkempt ""uniforms"".Conditions on BART trains themselves are dire as well. Over the past week there has been a heat wave in the Bay area. The heat inside the train cars generated from body heat from all the packed passengers along with the greenhouse heat from the lack of air conditioning made the trains very suffocating.Conditions in BART stations are horrendous. Besides the filth and the infrastructure from the 19th century. BART doesn't seem to have the concept of air filtration for the air in their stations. If you catch a glimpse of the station air through the rays of light during sunset, you will see just how thick with dust and who knows what the air is. It cannot possibly be safe to breath the air on BART. There is also very little police or security around BART stations and passengers are often harassed by individuals who are intoxicated, drunk, delusional, or being approached for money by ""street performers"". The number of delays resulting from ""criminal activity"" at stations prove my point. If you are reading this and you are a good lawyer, or know someone who is, please consider starting a class action lawsuit against BART or the BART workers union. They consistently failed to meet their schedule or provide the service thousands of people pay for everyday. That should be false advertising at the least and passengers should be refunded all their fares for the last year, if not more. Have someone measure their reliability scientifically of you must but this is a solid claim.Furthermore, lawsuits should also be filed in regards to the neglect they have made in regards to passengers' health and safety; whether it's the heavily polluted air (scientifically measurable) or the overheating and suffocating train cars (also easily measurable). This would make a long lawsuit but the claim base will be huge.",bart
110,1,"Aug 30, 2016","It's official. BART is the most miserable excuse of public transport systems in the world. Don't really know where to start. For many people who commute to work everyday, and thanks to Bay Area traffic driving is not an option, they are forced into using BART. However, if you think the existence of BART solves the issue of Bay Area commuting, you'd be dead wrong.BART has a schedule that they list on every station, the kind of schedule legitimate public transport systems have; you may have seen schedules that resemble it in other countries or cities. It's a very rudimentary schedule, the kind even an ape would be able to follow. Yet it is all a cruel prank on its passengers. Simply put, if you plan to get to your destination by following the BART schedule, you will NEVER arrive on time. I can't recall a single day where trains where not delayed by some sort of excuse (mechanical failure, criminal activity, smoke in train, pants on fire, whatever). If it happens just once, it's an understandable mishap. But when it happens 4 out of 5 working days EVERY WEEK, then it's more down to the system and the people who run it. One has to wonder how many screw ups it takes to mess up a system where trains run from Point A to Point B on preplanned schedule on a closed track. And these jokes who called themselves BART employees still have the nerve to go on strike and ask for better wages.In short, if you need to get somewhere and have the option to use something other than BART, use that thing other than BART. But if you enjoy being stuck in dark tunnels for unknown amounts of time while being lied to about why you're being stuck in said dark tunnel and in the company of too many people with little to no air conditioning, BART has your back.",bart
111,1,"May 15, 2016","Always late, unreliable, filthy cars and overpriced. Those are just a few civil words I can think of for the Bay Area Rapid Transit.BART is a joke of a public transportation system that is run on an antiquated system and ancient hardware by a group of employees who are lazy and self entitled. For an area known for technological advancement, BART is truly a disgrace to the area. To those of us who have lived in parts of the world with an actual public transportation system, there really is not even a single quality to BART. There is no system to speak of, trains just show up whenever conductors please, usually 3 to 4 minutes behind the published schedule - that is if they are ""on time"". More often than not, there are ""significant delays"" which literally happens on a daily basis. These ""significant delays"" would not be much of an issue if BART didn't run on a schedule that only has one train slithering by every 10 minutes. With the demand for public transportation the way it is, BART is already failing. Every single day during rush hour, people are left stranded on platforms, as train after train arrive and leave packed, usually 5 to 6 trains go by before they can find one to squeeze themselves onto. This is not the kind of service passengers should expect, especially with the current ticket prices. And with the demand increasing, there is no way BART, in the way it is run now, will possibly cope.A large part of BART's failure is down to its employees. There is too high of a reliance on a group of individuals who have extremely low standards when it comes to quality of service, and a very high level of entitlement when it comes to pay and benefits for their shoddy work. Strikes and complete shutdowns are pretty much expected every few months, and the entire Bay Area suffers because of these selfish individuals.At a time when the population of the Bay Area is increasing every month, radical change is much needed for BART. Huge investments in its infrastructure is needed to create a transportation system that can actually sustain the increased traffic in the Bay Area. As the centre for technological advancement, BART should be moving away from its reliance on manpower and towards autonomy. The vast majority of the functions performed by its employees can be replaced by autonomous systems, which will perform better and complain less.It is a real shame that in an area as great as the Bay Area, transportation is a choice between hours stuck in traffic, and a unreliable, disgusting relic that has no business operating in this century.",bart

It goes between the airport to the downtown area and across the bay quite directly, and the convergence of lines around the city center makes it easy to get a train there. The light rail (I'm just reviewing the whole transit system) goes straight to the baseball stadium, but nowhere near the Golden Gate bridge (i.e. the thing you came to SF for). There's also this weird mix of light rail and underground going on where the same train will go in and out of tunnels; a streetcar becomes a subway and then goes back again. I found it easy to get a card at the airport, and the costs have not been bad. The trains don't run frequently enough at off hours, and everything is on the dated side.Yelp reviews aren't really the place for social commentary, but without making any statement on the details of San Fransisco politics and policy (because I don't know enough), I can only say that whatever they are doing for the city's homeless population is not working. I was greeted on my first train by someone loudly threatening to kill whoever they were talking on the phone with, and subsequently encountered several more people who were clearly struggling in life. The police were reasonably caring in handling a homeless gentleman with an apparent case of cellulitis who troubled the passengers with his behavior, but no one stopped a passenger from drinking root beer laced with whiskey out of a can. DC's public transit system, where I'm from, is superficially similar, but it is literally a news story every time someone gets caught with food or drink on a train. This sort of behavior is not normal in any city I've visited on either side of the world, but it is the stereotype that all of us non-locals think of when they think of San Francisco, and the stereotype appears to be true. Given how filthy rich the city is, you'd think they could do better at taking care of their transit system and their people.",bart

Confusing ticket terminals. They were a tad confusing for me to use. I wish I could just tell the system where I am and where I'm going instead of cross-referencing a wall chart, then paying.2. Where am I? I think I'm going deaf, since at each stop I wasn't totally clear on where we were - and signage wasn't particularly consistent. On one occasion, we stopped at a station and had NO IDEA where we were.

Hundreds of thousands of annoyed passengers coping with daily schedule delays. It's the big turd in the Bay Area punchbowl. The Bay Area is a boom region. Everyone knows this!!! It came roaring back from the recession and BART didn't bother to notice. I do not care if the timing was bad or the recession hampered an upgrade. There is NO excuse for this. You want people not to drive? Give them a reason! Learn to plan!

They post a chart on the wall to help you locate your final destination and pay the corresponding fare.  We waited in line ten minutes to purchase our tickets because the people in front of us were confused about the ticket buying process.  It's definitely not intuitive.  If you pay with a $20 bill, the ticket machine assumes that you want to buy a $20 ticket.  If you want one for a smaller dollar amount you have to subtract value from your $20 ticket in $1 increments.I appreciate BART for getting us from the airport to the burbs in a reasonable amount of time.  That's about all the praise I can muster up though.We rode one of the 1970s era trains that looks like a silver sock puppet with racing stripes.  The ride was rough and incredibly loud.  Actually, loud isn't even the word to describe the grating shriek of metal on metal--it was almost demonic.  I'm prone to motion sickness so being jostled around for much of the ride made me feel queasy too.The main reason I didn't enjoy my ride on BART is because the train car and track didn't seem designed for one another and it made for an uncomfortable ride.

For me to get from the East Bay (Dublin/Pleasanton) into SF it costs me $5.50. Way too expensive.It feels like they purposely make the pricing system complex so that you leave the system with  unused money on your ticket. The tickets are paper so they're harder to maintain and their ticket machines are nowhere near as user friendly as other machines.Parking at a station? Good luck figuring out how to pay.

150,1,"Sep 17, 2017","I grew up taking BART and while it was always loud and dirty, it has gotten to a point where it is essentially unusable. Everyone already knows about the complete lack of security in the stations or on the trains, the fake security cameras which were only recently replaced with real ones, the incredible mismanagement of funds leading to janitors sleeping in utility closets to rack up $250k+ salaries, a new station that took over 18 years to plan and open, tracks that could potentially bend in high heat, and stations covered in urine and feces. So I don't even need to talk about that.But on top of the epic (almost comical level of) newsworthy problems leading to this case study of a poor transit system is a complete lack of acknowledgement by BART. I was personally on a train recently in which 5 teenagers roamed through and threatened to rob several passengers, ending in the group chasing someone off the train into the Lake Merritt station to get his wallet. I reported this to BART and got the most irresponsible response. Instead of acknowledging the problem, asking what date and time it happened so they could potentially look at the security camera footage, or any more details about the crime, they just deflected blame. They told me it was likely just a copycat crime similar to Coliseum robbery and that they can't have security everywhere. And that was it. No wonder nothing gets better on BART if they can't admit there is a problem and refuse to do anything even when a crime is reported.Last week I walked up the stairs at Civic Center station and passed a group of about 10 people smoking crack pipes, shooting up and drinking alcohol on the steps. As I exited the station I saw SFPD and told them what I just experienced. The officer laughed and said that was BART's problem. Well BART doesn't think it's their problem either.

They took it out and decided to smoke it rather then shoot it up (kindly not leaving any needle behind.) They both were very high and both nodded off into a drug state at the the same time. Called the BART Police who were really not sounding very interested in getting involved. I told them what train we were on and they said OK. The two gentlemen woke up in San Bruno and decided to get off the train. I called BART dispatch back and advised them and they hung up on me before I finished talking.On the way back we decided to stop in San Francisco to visit a friend to find out that there was $5 extra dollars for this privilege per ticket.  After walking over needles and the homeless and smelling the air full of urine. I attempted to get clarification from a BART employee in the booth regarding the $10 plus dollars deducted off the cards he told me to be quiet. NO CUSTOMER SERVICE SKILLS WHAT SO EVER. I added more money to one of the tickets. Since there no change machine working when I attempted to add more money to the second ticket I used a ATM card the machine took the ticket that has $1.15 left on it and charged $24.15 to a new BART card and would not provide a reciept.Got on train sat in what felt like a wet seat, to no surprise since there are no bathrooms to be heard of someone just probably pissed their pants. Get back to Orinda and one ticket goes through and the other one still says it does not have enough cash on it even though I added cash on it at Montgomery.Station agent at Orinda was only person with any common sense he took tickets could see I put money on both tickets and let us go, as if to say yea yea I know this system is totally messed up, I know.

Yes, I'll admit it: I scoured YouTube on the 'how to' vids and any kind of tips I could find in Reddit or wherever I could find them. I analyzed and reanalyzed the maps and broke everything down into charts, graphs, and color codes. I didn't want to take an Uber. I wanted to experience the BART. When I landed at the airport, I felt empowered. I was gonna DO THIS. I asked an airport employee where I should start and she was kind enough to take me pretty much all the way to the starting connection. I walked up to the machine and purchased my ticket. I was almost there. Sweating... such an intense moment. I saw other people who were standing around confused at what to do. In my mind I was like, ""HA! I watched YouTube how to's! I studied!"" I was so excited I had to remember to break away from it to pay attention as to which train was the one I needed to take. I got on, luggage and all... and heard the boarding signal. Within a matter of minutes, the train was moving. At each stop I looked at my trusty BART app and watched which stops were which so I could get a better idea of how fast we were going and of course, see where I was at so I wouldn't miss my stop. I did enjoy all the great scenery on the trip too so aside from the smooth ride, I got to take in a few pics & vids. It really wasn't all that bad. I got out about a block (more or less) from the Galleria Park Hotel and with a little more guidance from a local as to where the hotel was at, made it in no time.

It services and passes through the majority of the major cities and places in the Bay Area region. BART is also expanding further in the South Bay region, specifically in Warm Springs, Milpitas, and San Jose. Some trains are older with ragged seats and dirty floors. Nonetheless, the passenger experience isn't bad at all. Overall, the trains are maintained well. Cyclists have designated trains. For out-of-towners visiting the Bay Area, BART is easy to use with user-friendly maps and routes. However, compared to public transportations in other countries, BART can use with renovations and improvements. For example, Bangkok's BTS Skytrain can serve as a useful model for BART.",bart

180,4,"Apr 9, 2016","Even though the BART might not always been the fanciest form of travel, I am envious of such a convenient form of transportation throughout San Fransisco, Oakland and Berkeley. The BART is efficient, although sometimes there are delays and certain lines are closed, you'll find various options to get you to your final destination posted along the scrolling video screens by the tracks. Most stations have stairs and escalator options, although I noticed escalators don't always go in the same direction: you might only find a down escalator at one stop but an up escalator at another. This could be a hindering factor for bike users (of which there are plenty that use BART to get to another biking destination!)   Most stops are in very convenient locations throughout San Fransisco and Berkeley, you'll be a short walk from an ideal tourist spot. Also, you can get to and from the San Fransisco or Oakland airports using the Bart. As a new BART user, here are some helpful tips for new users: tickets are purchased through monitors, swipe your card and than you'll be prompted with pricing options. Find where you're heading (usually posted directly next to each monitor, both one way and round trip prices) and select the exact amount you need. Unfortunately, the system always prompts you to add $20.00 to your card, but you can change that amount if needed. AND if you don't put enough money on your card, no worries, you can add more once you reach your destination station. Take note: if you're trying to purchase multiple cards for multiple rides, select that option first before applying funds. If you're unsure of what to do, ask for help! There are BART employees are each station, just look for the box. Once you purchase your card {great value too BTW}, enter the gate and head down to the tracks. Make sure you're heading in the right direction--there are two sets of tracks! East Bay is towards Berkeley (North), while the other direction is towards San Fransisco Airport (South). Watch the monitors for exact time of car arrival and how many cars (this lets you know how far down you can stand). Seating and standing (with holders) available once you enter the car. Stations are called out over the speakers pre-arrival and there's a map on the wall of each car.",bart

Stop pan handling on BART and pretending it's for a charity, for your school, for a sports program, etc. If it was truly for one of these programs there would be an option to donate online that you would happily tell us all about- if the money was really for anything legit.Frankly I don't care what it's really for. Drugs, liquor, or even food. Cuz once you try to con me, I don't care anymore.And to those who give these people $$$ STOP! Please tell me you're really not that dumb? I mean really, have you looked at the ""paper work"" they're carrying? Oh, they didn't have any paper work? They left it at home? It's on notebook paper.There are typos? The wording includes slang and ""big"" words used out of context or just incorrectly?My favorite of these scam artists is a young, very good looking, African American Man who asks for a donation of a dollar for a youth organization he's clean cut, articulate, claims a good cause, and it's only a dollar. Only problem? Not only. Does his organization not exist, but it changes names constantly. Sometimes from car to car, or train to train.For those of you who are not familiar with how program donations work these days remember these basics..1. Any non profit seeking donations will provide volunteers (or those employed to raise money) with paper work, hand outs etc that detail who they are, what they do, all contact info, and how to go about making a donation.2. A receipt would be given or atleast offered for every donation no matter the size.3. Since cash donations are rare and sometimes people can't afford to that day but maybe would later, their would be info of how to donate on line, or at a later date.Those 3 things are absolutes. If any one of the 3 is missing then you're dealing with an amateur con artist who's to stupid and/or lazy to even con you well. Also just because a kid is cute doesn't mean that the money he/she is conning out of you is even going to them. More likely a parent put them up to it.

197,5,"Oct 14, 2010","I had a long time love-hate relationship with the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system but I didn't know how good I had it!  I'm so sorry, BART!  BART, you are the most used, convenient and reliable rapid transit system in the West Coast for a reason - bar none!MOST USED:Approximately 350,000 passengers ride BART every week, making it the fifth-busiest rapid transit system in the United States!  This is almost 200,000 more passengers than those that ride the Los Angeles County Metro Rail Red and Purple Line combined!  (Los Angeles and Orange County really needs to get with the program when it comes to use and priority it puts on public transportation, but we all know that!)  CONVENIENT:BART runs from 4a.m. to midnight and arrives at its destination about every 15 minutes!  And each stop it makes in-between is no more than two minutes!  BART continues to use its resources to improve the quality of the system and its ability to serve the public transportation needs. Some modernizations include major overhauls of the stations and extensions to the area covered by the BART lines.RELIABLE:BART has reportedly one of the highest on-time performance records in the nation.  Unanticipated delays, however, occasionally do happen.  Riders can learn about them by going directly to their website: www.bart.gov real time arrivals and learn of any delays.  Real time arrivals and trip planners can even be uploaded onto many mobile devices like the iPhone and the Android.  OTHER BENEFITS:What about time and cost savings to us and public safety (riding the train is reportedly 80% safer than riding in an automobile)?  If more people rode BART, this could significantly reduce the amount of air pollution and gas emissions to the San Francisco Bay Area region.  There could be broader benefits, if more people in our state learned to become more energy independent.  We could see a real reduction on reliance on foreign oil!I lived in San Francisco for four years, 1999 to 2003, and worked at the Civic Center.  I usually took the Dublin/Pleasanton - Daly City/Millbrae line to take me all over the East Bay and South San Francisco for both personal and business purposes.BART took me to our satellite offices throughout the East Bay, shopping at Union Square, dinner and drinks at the Embarcadero, lunch in the Mission District, to and from Oakland International Airport (OAK), Giants games, Golden State Warrior games, and visiting girlfriends in Daly City, Fruitvale and Hayward!  (Not all during the same time period.  That would be wrong!)Back then, major airlines like Southwest and American Airlines did not fly from Los Angeles into San Francisco International Airport (SFO).  Moreover, BART had not extended its lines to connect to the airport terminal.  Now, it is the city's major airport/public transit connector.  An already great rapid transit system became much more convenient and accessible after I moved away! I absolutely love BART!  Now, what's your excuse not to love it too?",bart

Escalators are always broken even just after being fixed, the trains get tore up even more (okay that's primarily the passengers' fault), the Spear Street entrance still isn't even opened back up yet, causing congestion when exiting the station while everyone's trying to get to the office!  Don't think that BART can help it, but besides the usual occasional homeless, crazy, drunk, or sketchy few that may be seen on BART occasionally, there's also from time to time solicitors..haven't seen that on Caltrain or Muni.  For the most part, the trains usually do run on time, up to every 15 minutes except for non-peak hours (after 8pm I believe on weekdays).  Another negative..let's not get started on the BART strike..I'm hoping that the union will come to an agreement before the deadline next month..though it's looking unlikely.  Living on the Peninsula, I do like Caltrain because it's clean and feels safer, but let's face it, Caltrain doesn't go to the FiDi, and taking Caltrain makes my trip longer.

It's been over ten years since I've ridden BART and things have changed (missing side-way seats for bikers, extra grips for standing passengers, and, of course, higher fares), but it's something that many take for granted. The bridge closure resulted in a sharp increase in ridership and probably lower smog and pollution levels in the Bay Area. For the commuting work force, it has been a lifesaver.

Last week, I caught the last train back to the East Bay at 12:15 am and found a group of teenagers expressing their discontent for the Oscar Grant shooting by taking down one of the hundreds of Adverts (that in theory reduce the cost to us riders by supplementing it with the Ad revenue) and making their own tribute. (See picture in photos.) With tensions still high and prices continuing to rise to use BART, I wonder how much more of will commuters put up with until BART runs itself into the ground?

Without BART and the bridges, it would take about 3 days by horse & carriage to get from SF to Oakland (that was less than 100 years ago!).

From a newbie's perspective I found a few aspects of the system to be confusing and awkward. Before I get to my complaints, there is one thing that would be huge if they had in Chicago - signs indicating how far out trains are, I'm so jealous!1) The ticket machines. When I walked off the airport shuttle to get my ticket, I was not expecting the clusterfuck of 30+ people that met me when the doors opened. The instructions on the machine are vague and lacking, which I think is being kind. It is not clear for the newbie or the technologically illiterate, especially when you have 29ish cranky travelers breathing down your neck. Things picked up when they posted a woman in-between the two working machines to talk people through it. Also, three machines at the airport station hardly seemed like enough to handle the demand.2) Signage. Living in Chicago, I'm very dependent on our rail system (the El). What I love about the El is that there are plenty of system and line-specific maps on the platforms and on the trains. I didn't feel the same way about BART - more signs please!3) Stop announcements. Sorry, another Chicago comparison is coming. Back in the day, the El was like BART, the announcer told you what stop you were approaching; I hated it then and I hate it now. Do they send announcers to some sort of training so that everything they say sounds like the teacher from Peanuts? Both times I rode the train I had a hard time hearing the announcer, which forced me position myself in the event I needed to quickly dart off the train at each passing stop. Getting an automated recording, which tells you not only what stop you're approaching, but what the next stop is would be aces.4) Overall BART is very clean, but the upholstered, cushy seats skeved me out. I feel like you can never get those things really clean and I highly doubt they're steam cleaned or disinfected nightly, let alone monthly.",bart

217,4,"Oct 28, 2006","BART, n. Bay Area Rapid Transit.  A railroad, with 104 miles of track, in Northern California.  Rapid, in this case, stands for 80 mph.  Originally built to reduce traffic across the Bay Bridge and to facilitate commuting to downtown San Francisco, its immediate effect was to inspire a network of suburban office parks at stations throughout the system.  Walnut Creek, Concord, and Pleasanton enjoyed a renaissance due to this real estate boom.  In the past two weeks BART officials have discovered some operating money and have been actually cleaning the trains, leading to a pleasant riding experience.  You can still hear them a mile away, as those electric paddles, steel dragging on steel, scream like jet engines.   BART, v.  To commute by rail, as in ""I BARTed to Concord for nine months, which was cheaper than driving.""   BARTable, adj.  Near a BART station, as in ""Will you take a contract with our client, if it's BARTable?""  Listen.  The best contracts, with the highest billing rates, are inside the City limits.  If you want me to BART to the suburbs again, you have it ass-backwards.  Call me when you have a client in San Francisco.   I still use BART to go to church near MacArthur Station, and I have used BART to get to both SFO and OAK.",bart

It's better for the environment, no worries about parking, or bridges tolls. BART has made it easier to get across the Bay, to get to SFO and Oakland airports, and eventually connecting to San Jose in the next few years.  It has made commuting and getting to different cities fast and convenient.  The Bay Area without BART would be like Hugh Hefner without Viagra, nobody's going no where.But the best part of BART is one particular employee.

220,2,"Jan 22, 2016","I use BART 4 times a week for my commute from Orinda-Montgomery and back. It can be smooth and tolerable, but when push comes to shove it's miserable. I can somewhat overlook the cleanliness (or lack thereof) of the stations and trains. Even though Montgomery is seriously extremely gross. They had people in hazmat suits clean the stairs at some point. That says all. What's more an issue is poor communication and the terrible design of the system itself. When something happens, the announcements through the intercom are barely audible because the quality is terrible. So you're left wondering what's going on and how long it'll take to resolve. Since everything from West Oakland through the later San Francisco stops is going through the same 2 tracks, any minor incident shuts the whole system down. It looks like they are updating the LED signs in the city, however signage at SFO are terrible. I have missed a late train due to insufficient signage, which made me arrive home 30 minutes later. I could have taken the train that was on the wrong side of the platform but it wasn't posted anywhere where that train would be headed. Station agents just shrug and didn't think it would be a big deal. A station like SFO that has many tourists should have proper signs. If the LEDs don't work, put temporary signs up, or stand on the platform and announce what's going on. It's not rocket science. Oh and another tidbit that drives me crazy are my fellow riders. People that stand right at the doors for 30-45 minutes straight should just move down the fricking aisle and not block the doors. Ridership 101 people.",bart

From now on, I will give them 1 hour and 15 minutes to 1 hour and 30 minutes.",bart
239,2,"Jul 10, 2015","I have mixed feelings about the BART, which I think just about everyone can agree with.  I will break this down from two viewpoints, and tell you how I arrived at my conclusion. Viewpoint #1- Lived in California their entire life, with a few trips to NYC, LA, and maybe London once.  I would say this person's name is John.  He loves the BART for its convenience and value.  It's the easiest way to get around - a good alternative to driving, and faster.  Usually reliable and usually clean, the BART provides good service for a wide area around the Bay.   He wishes it ran past midnight, but he's generally happy with the overall value proposition, all things considered. Viewpoint #2 - Grew up on the East Coast, near Boston and New York at separate times, and then lived in Asia for years, hitting the major metropolises and also visiting major cities in Europe and the Middle East.  So, even being as generous as possible, I can give BART a maximum of 2 stars.  First off, you need ear plugs when you're riding.  I've read it can spike over 100dBs at certain times under the bay, which is unacceptable for everyday riders to endure that.   Next, the stations and trains are not that dirty, but they're not clean either.   Tokyo and Seoul take the crown in that category.  For speed, BART is slower yet again, because there are constant delays and breakdowns.  How about having to transfer to another train when going from Berkeley to San Francisco?  This would be acceptable in a network like Seoul or Tokyo, but with 4 lines, no.  Just, no.BART fails in my eyes simply because of the network.   Seoul, Tokyo, Singapore, Hong Kong... I could go on - they all have extensive networks that provide incredible city coverage.  It's not just the coverage, however, because those places all have more people.  Would you guess that the BART is the most expensive out of all of them?  Singapore's minimum fare is under $1.  Seoul is right around there as well.  I can't expect round-the-clock service, but even my minimum expectations are not met on mass transit in San Francisco (bus, muni...also looking at you).  Yes, it's better than some other places I've been (Ghana, Vietnam, Myanmar, Laos), but to be such a great place to live and have this as a huge negative is disappointing.  The thing is, I don't see it getting better anytime soon.",bart

Sure, I've taken the BART before, but now I actually have a high value BART pass in my wallet for those random moments when I'll be BARTing in around the Bay.  And you can't help but love that BART will take you to SFO and OAK airports now!  How sweet is that?!  One would wonder how did we ever survive w/o BART to the airports before?  Did we all rely on Super Shuttle before?  Heavens no!  I love that I can go to work, and head straight to the airport after work to begin my little adventure.  And then from the airport and straight back to work, can't beat that!And sure, it can take awhile, but it'll get you there.

Every time the Bart races into a tunnel, I'm tempted to throw my hands in the air and scream like a kid on a roller coaster. Here's a piece of information I wish I'd known sooner though - the Bart does not operate all night! I used to ride the light rail in Minneapolis, MN (which runs 24-7) on a regular basis, so I assumed any city larger than Minneapolis would of course have a 24-7 rail system as well. Long story short though, on my most recent San Francisco trip I had to catch a 5am plane at the SF International Airport and was surprised to learn that the Bart wouldn't be able to get me there since it's closed between the hours of 1am-5am. Despite this major snafu, I'm still leaving a four star review because I love public transportation (weird, I know). So make it a train, and I'm like a kid who wants to spend her day riding the mall escalator over and over.",bart
242,1,"Apr 17, 2015","I'm lost for words when it comes to how much I hate BART. Everything about it sucks from the ride quality to the customer service. Here's why:1. Overcrowded trains - if BART knows there's a buncha people that ride this heap during rush hour, they should have more trains or cars but instead, they allow people to cram in like a buncha sardines.2. The fares - it seems like every other year, BART increases fares and for what? Riders don't get more frequent trains or cleaner cars. It also seems like escalators constantly fail. Good luck if you have a sprained ankle. The El Cerrito plaza center raised there parking fare from a $1 in cash to $3 in a year. Also if you don't have cash after you fight someone for a parking spot, God be with you because the machines only accept cash. 3. Delays - I used to ride BART from the east bay to San Francisco every morning for work. Almost always was I delayed. Medical emergencies, train in front of ours, stop and go traveling through the tunnel etc. One day, I left an hour earlier than normal to anticipate a delay and I still managed to come into work 30 minutes late due to a ""medical emergency"". 4. The union - BART employees are the highest public transportation employees in the country. Yet they always want raises and when they don't get them, they shut down BART and most of the Bay Area is a sh!t show during commute hours. Higher ups of BART are too stupid to realize they should hire a buncha temp employees to train them during the negotiation months to operate trains incase this moron union decided to throw another b!tch fit.5. Ride quality - if you've ever ridden BART, I'm sure you'll know it always seems like the damn heater is on or you're in a sauna because it's just really overcrowded. Either way, with increasing fares, you'd figure BART would have money to install AC or some type of temperature control machine in these overcrowded cars. Each train during rush hour commute is a breathing ground for sickness and diseases. The one time I ride BART this week is the time I caught the flu. Thanks BART. 6. The lack of bathrooms - the other day may train took 40 minutes to pick me up and nearly two hours to get me home. If you ever need to take a piss due to a ""medical emergency"" or any other BS delay, do it before you ride this heap. There aren't any bathrooms in most of the stations.",bart

I'm also frustrated b/c I commute on a BART, and at least once a week there seems to be some type of delay. BART keep raising prices, but I don't see any improvements.

It was rather creepy now that I think about it. Blood or urine? Random beverages? I dunno, and the stains are always in the corner of the car, but this one was huuuuge.But stains aside, BART picks me up from a few blocks from the pad and delivers me safely near work, and for how many trains are going on all the time I don't think the delays are really that big of deal.

When it opened it was kind of futuristic.  A little like Tomorrowland at Disneyland.  But like Tomorrowland time has passed BART by.  Now it is aging and in need of major overhauls.   Trains and stations are filthy, overcrowded and inefficient.BART needs to do more policing of bad behaving passengers.  For the most part passengers work together to make the best of overcrowded commute or special event clogged trains.  However, I have seen too many louts blocking 4 seats with bikes while the car is overly crowded with standing passengers.  Or the pigs taking two or more seats and refusing to share the space with others.  Other passengers should not have to confront these belligerent thugs.  Passengers should also move into the cars and avoid crowding at the exits.BART contributes to the problem by running shorter trains.  It is exasperating to wait for a Fremont or Richmond train while 3 or 4 virtually empty 10 car other trains pass only to be packed into a 3, 4 or 5 car train.There are other issues that others have identified, but BART is the best we've got.

I can leave the car at home and not worry about traffic, road rage, the cost of gasoline, toll booths, cops in my rear view mirror, parking fees, parking tickets, wasting my time looking for a place to park, etc.3. I can read the paper, or my kindle, get work done, listen to my mp3 all while leaving the driving to someone else.4. Trains are virtually always on time, if not then it's only a few minutes extra wait unless of course there's some sort of emergency.5.  Paying by Clippercard.  It's quick, efficient, and you can reload your card anytime, either online or at any BART or MUNI station.Things that annoy me:1.  The solicitors that manage to roam the trains2.  The crowded trains at rush hour especially around Powell St./Civic center.  Sometimes there's no room to even get on.  3.  The lack of restrooms at many stations.  EVERY station ought to have a restroom available.4.  I do wish there was more of a police presence on board the trains.5.  Smelly people who don't bathe or wash their clothes.  There are a lot of complaints about this from other reviewers but this is not BART's fault.  However, the new easy-to-clean seat coverings is a big improvement.  The pros out-weigh the cons by far, as far as I'm concerned.

(I guess could be a plus or minus).Great things about BART is that it connects the Multiple cities across the bay area. You can't beat it. Also it was always on time and I love the updates on when the train is coming into the station. Futuristic cars but still aging but very roomy. I wish we had open cars like that here in Chicago. It would help with all those people and there luggageStill I felt confused on which line I should be jumping on. Somehow I always ended up on the Yellow line which was fine with me because that's where I needed to be. Overall I am just a fan of Pub Trans and I would definitely ride the BART again. No questions asked.,bart
262,1,"Dec 6, 2017",I keep hearing these advertisement for ride BART and how the fares will be going up .20. But I don't ride BART because 1. it is never on time. 2. I work in SF and I have to be at work at 4 am. 3. On sundays BART doesn't start until 8 am when I have to be at work at 7am. So I drive it makes no sense to even attempt to ride public transportation here in the East Bay. Now SF has the right idea there muni system is AWESOME! 24/7 service and it's ontime. I moved here from the east coast where you have public transportation 24/7. Sad for the East bay.. I guess I will always have to drive until I move to another state.,bart
263,5,"Jul 6, 2010","BART is a great light rail system used to get around the Bay Area. I especially like it since it goes to SFO and there are connecting stops with the MUNI. Great way to maneuver within SF or the Bay Area. BART is fast, efficient, fairly priced, and has accessible locations. I've used the BART to travel to various areas within the Bay Area and have had no problems whatsoever. Hawaii will eventually build its light rail system. I'm hoping i will be just as good or better (*knock on wood*).",bart
264,4,"Jan 23, 2011","It's kind of pricey for public transportation but was cheaper than getting a cab and faster and more convenient than a bus or a cab.

265,4,"Jan 29, 2011","I recently returned to the Bay Area for a visit. BART is definitely a great means of transport. Yesterday, I took BART from Fruitvale Station to 24th and Mission. BART was on time and took me to my destination ontime.When you go through the transbay tube though, it can be quite noisy. In fact, portions of BART can be really noisy so you may be advised to wear earplugs. One new improvement to BART is that they removed the old green carpet from the floor. That green carpet reminded me of barf and overtime was getting extremely worn by the foot traffic.BART is more on the pricer end in terms of cost. You pay by distance. There are kiosks located at each station. You purchase the ticket, insert the ticket through the turnstile and retrieve the ticket as you pass through the turnstile. This ticket will have to be used again when you exit your final destination.Some of the stations are shady, so be vigilant and be aware of your surroundings. The best thing about BART is that one the route conveniently takes you directly from SFO into the city. From OAK, there is an AirBART bus, not as convenient as SFO.",bart
266,3,"Jan 3, 2012","I normally love BART - it gets me to work every morning and saves me on gas, wear and tear on my car, bridge toll and expensive SF parking.  But to have an 8 car train followed by a 5 car train on the Pittsburg/Bay Point line during regular commute hours is absolutely ridiculous!!  They shouldn't even think of having an 8 car train on that line in the morning or evening commutes.  Also, the train doesn't run until 8 am on Sundays so while they want you to take the train to SFO, you can't if you have any flights before 10:30 a.m. on Sunday.They say how much it costs them to run 24 hours (or even til 3 a.m. on a weekend night) but there are a few things they could do to make riding BART more convenient for customers - but they refuse to.Get with the program BART",bart

Sure, it only makes a few stops, so it's not exactly useful for getting to specific places (i.e. you still need to do a lot of walking once you get off the nearest BART exit)...but at least it's much faster and cleaner than the buses in SF! It can get a little pricey at around $8.25 on average for most places, but you can re-load your card anytime, so you don't lose out on any money you've already paid for. Overall, I'm impressed by how organized the system is, considering SoCal has nothing like this!",bart

So I feel extremely confident in saying there isn't backed up train traffic. What the F? Boooo, BART, booooo. Hustle up.",bart
271,5,"May 14, 2007","BART is wonderful.  It is cleaner than any other subway/metro system (NYC, DC, Chicago, Boston).  Unlike most, it has plush seats and carpet.  The trains are always on time.  People wait in line in a civilized manner instead of pushing onto the train en masse.  The other really great thing about BART is easy access to information.  Online, it is easy to use Trip Planner and map routes and find schedules.  At the station, there are signs to tell you exactly which train is approaching, plus maps and schedules.  They announce when trains will be arriving, and which ones when and where.  None of these things happen in NY on the subway, where you have to figure out if the train is express or local, they aren't well-labeled, it's hard to figure out which is which direction, and if you go in the wrong entrance, you've lost your subway fare and have to repay once you go in the other way.",bart

There are the nice old Chinese ladies who don't really know what stop to get off at, so I help em' out if I can understand them. There are the hippies and the drunks.And then there are the pervs, like the one that decided it'd be cool to sit a couple feet away from me and stare (and stare, and stare some more...) while openly masturbating.

275,3,"Nov 17, 2008","It was my first time riding the BART last week. Before coming up to the bay area I had heard mixed reviews about it.The BART trains do come quite frequent. At the Millbrae station my friend told me that they are usually nice and wait a few minutes for the CalTrain ppl to arrive. But I guess that day they weren't so nice. When I stepped into the train I immediately noticed the carpeted floors. I thought it was nice, but I thought again about how it must be gross when it rainy and the floor must be all wet. And carpet in general is not easy to clean. Their seats remind me a lot of airplane seats. The ride northbound from Milbrae to SF was VERY loud and squeaky. For each of the stops, I couldn't hear the operator announce the stops. I wish they had something like the lightrail where the name of the next stop is flashing in red. The BART stops at every stop, which can be a bit slow of a commute. The ride itself is quite smooth. People standing with bikes can comfortably stand with their bike when the train stops. The trains are always packed, especially when you near SF.",bart
276,3,"Jun 25, 2018","BART has a bit of a reputation for being dirty and nasty, and while that is somewhat true, it hardly ever gets so bad that it bothers me. The lines extend to a lot of the bay, so it's pretty convenient. The stations are a little dirty, but the fares are reasonable and you can always buy a Clipper Card. Also, sometimes trains can be too far apart, but it's not too bad. The new trains look clean and sound quieter, maybe that'll improve the service.",bart

I also see drunk bums sleeping and snoring in the train. Heidous sight, isn't it?Also, the overpaid,& uneducated station agents (mostly ladies) are not the friendliest. They may get paid very well, but they are extremely rude to riders,especially visitors who want to go to the Airport.

286,3,"Oct 3, 2008","I have no problems with the public transportation system that surrounds San Francisco. Like my trip to New York, there is an AirTrain that goes from San Francisco International Airport to an underground transportation system. In New York, the AirTrain took me to the MTS subway system. In this case, the AirTrain went to the BART station after about four stops. For those of you uninitiated, the BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) is an underground train system that begins at SFO Airport and extends through the city of San Francisco and into Oakland and the East Bay. It goes as far north as Concord, passing Berkeley on the way. The BART moves fast, is clean, and relatively quiet. We arrive at the Powell St. station to get to our hotel.The BART was less friendly on our little diversion to Oakland to see the Chargers-Raiders game last Sunday. Getting there from the Powell St. station was fine. Make one transfer onto the train bound for the Coliseum and you were set. Only leaving the game became a hassle. A giant human traffic jam met us outside the stadium and in the elevated walking bridge to the platform. We walked for nearly a half hour amongst drunken Raiders fans (I was reminded of Sean Connery's line in The Last Crusade about being ""pilgrims in an unholy land""), then resorting to taking the Concord train to get away from the human masses gathered at the Coliseum platform, then transferring to a train that went into San Francisco.

290,3,"Jan 31, 2018","Honestly, the BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) as is, is in need of major upgrades to their trains, the bathrooms are always locked and not able to use, and the elevators smell horribly. In recent news and experience it is being remodeled (slowly). The new train on the track is absolutely beautiful and clean and state of the art. BART is easily accessed from Richmond to Millbrae, to Fremont to Pittsburg. There are many other stops along the way. You can access both Oakland & San Francisco Airports directly. SF airport requires one transfer to Caltrain but it isn't that difficult. The prices have raised this year 2018. There is also a surcharge to using BART's paper ticket vs. the clipper card. Clipper card's cost 3$ one time. Each time you use a paper ticket you are charged an extra .50 cents per trip. So invest in a clipper card. Elevator access is almost every BART location is riddled with human pee. I recommend you avoid elevator access at all times. It's simply unmanageable on the smell. It is in part due to no public access for the homeless community to use. Three stars because you can get across the Bay in under an hour. By car, can take two to three hours almost all times of the day in traffic.",bart

However, since this is my 150th review, and channeling Amy Z's cable car review, I'm going to do something a little different.Here are 10 things I've seen on BART or at stations over the years:10. Myself, carrying a windsurfing mast (it's 7 foot broken down). BART police came to check it out. 9. Wine bottle opener left on a bench. Now attached to kitchen via uphaul (bungee cord) to sailing club kitchen table. 8. Woman dressed as twister game at Halloween. 7. The great view from the Rockridge platform. 6.  A/C breaking down during the middle of summer. 5. The guy who plays Cello on the Pittsburg line. Makes a nice change from the family who does bad renditions of Beatles songs. 4.  The irregular Giants, A's, Raiders fans who take all the seats from us ""regulars"". No, it's cool and all, except when you drink! 3. The guy smoking an e-cigarette in my face. 2. The guy who turned down his cell phone *very slightly* after I said it was too loud. 1. The people talk loudly on their phones. My all-time favorite was just recently. A white woman, having apparent baby-daddy issues, ripping a new one from some guy for a full 20 minutes including through the transbay tunnel (and maybe beyond, she got off before me). The best part ""He pays more for my phone because you're CHEAP!"". Just how do you get two guys to pay for your phone? All in all, BART is pretty great. The problem is the occasional idiots, which are hardly their fault. Staff have always been nice to me, it's almost always reliable. It just doesn't go everywhere. Go on, admit it.

Someone needs to record their jobs on Youtube for all to see where their fare money and tax dollars are going.It will be particularly funny when the $500 million connector to Oakland Airport results in fares skyrocketing again - or when smart groups of business travelers split the $13 cab fare from Coliseum directly to the terminal door - rather than risking their wallet on the $6 driverless trams crawling to the Oakland Airport parking lot. Even better would be smart Uber or Lyft drivers shuttling airport patrons back to the terminal for $9 a run. And we will NEVER forget the one week strike that held us all hostage.

It is always late.  Always.  2.  It is usually vastly over-crowded, likely because it's always late.  3.  The cars are humid as fuck, even when not crowded.  To touch upon the last point a bit, I'm a decently fit guy yet every SINGLE morning, I have to plan extra time on the way to my SF office bathroom to utilize paper towels for wiping all the sweat off my body resulting from the humid-assed Bart cars.  This morning in particular, it was decently cold outside.  I chose to wear my lightest jacket, and I STILL was sweating my ass off, along with everyone else, in my Bart car (which surprisingly was not over-crowded like it usually is).  I'm almost 100% sure the heat wasn't even on.  You want to know what the real culprit is??? No fucking air-flow.

As fares continue to rise, we as the lowly patrons have come no closer to an end to the constant delays associated with: Track Issues, Medical Emergencies, Police Activity, Train Back-ups, and Single Tracking. Why is it when you get to those stations, it is as if nothing happened, is it just me? If you're running late just be a big boy/girl as an agency and say ""We apologize, but we're running late today."" I'm not saying that these things do not happen, however there are about 3 delays a week, and these are the regular announcements, if there are any announcements made. I'd honestly feel a whole lot better if you'd actually be truthful with me though. So on top of all of this, Bart employees treat their patrons like garbage, get paid a whole lot to do so, and throw in a strike from time to time. All of this is not the way a public transport system and/or any company should operate. Look I am just a patron who helps you as an individual/company (Bart) pay for the gas in your expensive car, it is not my fault that you live outside your means, do not take that out on us as patrons. Bad Attitudes, Expensive Fares, Expensive Parking, Terrible Bathrooms all make up the face that is Bart. With all this being said, I still take Bart everyday, because what alternative do I have that is environmentally and socially conscious and correct. DO A BETTER JOB AT BEING COURTEOUS, RESPECTFUL, AND APPROPRIATE, JUST MAYBE YOU'D HAVE LESS COMPLAINTS!* This stems from an incident that happened to me yesterday (Sept. 15th, 2017), when I was verbally accosted by a Bart employee named Adriana @ the MacArthur Station in Oakland, CA.

311,3,"Sep 7, 2015","BART parking is priced too low, and the lots fill up immediately (meaning prior to 8AM).I traveled to San Francisco Bay Area for the 2nd time, two  years in a row for the VMworld Conference held at the Moscone Convention Center. BART is the only option really if you choose to stay in a motel/hotel outside San Francisco as there is little or no parking downtown. Keep in mind the hotel rooms are $300 to $600 per night during this convention.Since my first session was never before 8:30AM, I thought I would ride the BART system into downtown around 8AM. The problem is you WILL NOT find a parking space at most of their park and ride locations. I went from station to station using the WAZE app on my phone on two different mornings. Here are the stations I could not find parking at after 8AM:No Parking after 8AM (until 10AM): Richmond, Berkley NorthThe only station I consistently found good parking was at Hayward.The cost to park varies, from $2/day to $2.50/day. I heard from other travelers on the system that the parking rate has gone up to the aforementioned prices. They need to consider raising these per day rates again, to reduce the number of people using the parking lot so that travelers like myself have half a chance to park their rental cars. I would go even as far as having a designated section of the their lots where you can choose to pay a higher rate, as in $5/day to pretty much guarantee parking for riders who are willing to pay more to save time, etc.The trains themselves are fine, arrive and depart on time and charge according to distance traveled. My average fare was $4.90 per trip. The need more fare card machines inside and outside the stations too as some are broken, or only accept cash.The only other MAJOR problem with BART is they take the system out of service too often between Oakland and San Francisco to perform maintenance. This is the second time this summer the system has been down for more than one day.",bart

What the fuck is up with your ticket machines?$5, minus $1, minus $1, minus $1, minus 5 cents, minus 5 cents, minus 5 cents divided by the square root of Pi, minus 5 cents, minus 5 cents, carry the 1, multiplied by your 7th grade gym locker combination plus your hat size...and then it spits out a ticket.Then you have to figure out what train goes where.

313,4,"Feb 5, 2010","For reasons both familial and professional, I've always considered myself bi. Coastal, that is. One of the major perks in my escape from behind the Orange Curtain was BART. I love my family, but I don't miss the 5, 405, 91 or the 10 freeways. While BART does not have the extensive range or highly desirable schedule that other Tubes, Bullet Trains or Subway Systems have... I still adore it for the pure entertainment value. BART is where I can truly be a voyeur, since I'm the only one NOT listening to an iPod, nodding off with my mouth open, or completely engrossed in the WSJ or a good bodice-ripper novel. Morning commutes are almost completely silent, with a few exceptions: (a) Young College student on her mobile, ""confiding"" to her BFF that she's pregnant and is on the fence about scheduling an abortion. ""Promise me, no - seriously - swear to me that you WILL NOT TELL ANYONE!"" She practically screamed into her cell. ""Can you hear me now? Yeah, so... where was I? Oh, I'm going to Italy for that work-study... in the Spring, and he's like... hella freaked out. I know. So, of course I wanna have kids someday, just not right now. But PROMISE me you will NOT LET THIS GET OUT. I would be so embarrassed if anyone knew."" (b) I have watched educated, professional women (primarily) hold onto the rails, and LICK THEIR FINGERS between each page turn of their bodice-ripper book. And eat full-blown meals, ranging from McBillions to coffee house muffins and sandwiches. Fascinating AND disgusting. Purell, anyone? And maybe pay attention to the fine you can incur for eating on BART, never mind the microbes, germs and other filth you're ingesting along with that bagel. (c) Jeebus, Mary and Joseph... what is that horrific smell? It *could* be the Service Dog... or maybe it was actually that corpulent guy 2 seats over, who conspicuously shifted his weight and now looks more notably relieved. Yeah... even the Service Dog is whimpering, it was the guy. (d) My favorite: A woman and her 2 young children board; a guy in a suit and tie is sitting on the inside of a 4 seater configuration; Mom and kids are facing each other. Mom is multi-tasking - alternately berating her children or threatening to beat them. The oldest is in first grade, tops. All of this dramz while she's on her cell, regaling her friend about the fight she had with ""some bitch"" - and she's dropping the F-bomb like it's going out of style. I felt empathy for the children, but they were so insubordinate and unfazed by the stream of profanity spewing from their Mom's mouth, it was actually very sad. ""Oh, wait, girl - I'm gonn' hafta call you back, I'm goin' through a - Hello?"" She'd start in on the kids again. ""Why didn't you let yo' sister use the bathroom this mornin'? What the f*ck is wrongwitchoo? Y'all better f*cken get yo' sh*t together; 'cuz I ain't gonn' tell you one mo' 'gain."" WTF? My degree is in Literary Journalism, so all of the grammatical issues were a very close second in the whole level of discomfort for how the children were treated. Not to mention the poor suit and tie man, who seemed to be melting into the wall, so as to put as much space between himself and Moms. ""Oh, girl... So where was I? Oh, yeah - so then I called her up and was all, Bitch, you don't know me! I will f*ck you up!"" Road Rage vs. BART Dramz. But seriously, Girl: I do not f*ckin' miss the sh*tty traffic - AND I AIN'T GONN' TELL YOU ONE MO' 'GAIN!",bart

315,1,"Mar 21, 2007","The tickets: - I've had more tickets lose their magnetic info than I care to consider.  The last time I talked to a booth person about it there was a sign on the window listing what could de-magnetize the card: cell phones, credit cards, keys, cameras, change, etc.  Why not just say ""anything you have in your pockets"" and be done with it?  Where am I supposed to keep the fucking thing, in my teeth like a pirate? - When you have to set up booths to exchange the ""tiny tickets"" with remainders on them, your system is fundamentally flawed.  When the prices are set up so that there is no reasonably easy way to travel regularly without ending up with remainders, your system is a god damn scam. - BART finally implemented their EZ-Rider tickets, like an EZ pass for BART people.  It's a limited program (WHY?) and you have to MAIL-IN a printed out PDF application.  I suppose this is better than sending a herald, or having it delivered by Pony Express, but what the hell, man??? The Stations: - The spectrum of filth varies from abattoir to back-alley, often scented with that horrible industrial cleanser.  No trash cans = trash on floor, on seats, on me. - Manned by the most languid and irritatingly snobby people, the Ticket Booths are a mecca for institutionalized smartassery and heavy-lidded unhelpfulness.  No, I didn't jump the turnstyle, yes I know I have to use the ticket on the way out, no I didn't keep the ticket next to my cell phone - what's that?  Oh, the ticket is ""bad""?  Thanks for a voucher to go to a different station and turn it in to an exchange program - ARE YOU EFFIN SERIOUS???  (answer: yes)  No one could say ""sorry sir"" and mean it less than these drones. - The Embarcadero escalators are broken every single day.  EVERY DAY!  For years it's been like that.  I know the names of the repair people's KIDS for crying out loud. - I'm sure there's a good reason to have BART police outside the station in cars, but I'm not sure how much that helps me inside on the platform when Dr. Empty-Your-Pockets comes by. The Trains: - Public transportation that essentially dries up at 8PM is good for Backass, Nowhere but it's full-bore bullshit for a city that I think everyone would agree is one of the top-10 in the world.  Full closure at midnight?  Bollocks. - LRN 2 DRIVE PLZ.  At least 3 times this month the train has just gone right on down the platform, half the train past the station and half on the platform.  I don't even run to catch up like everyone else, I just laugh. - I'd like an hour or so in a closed room with the fucking hippie who decided that wrapped sponges was a good idea for public transportation seats.

317,4,"Mar 2, 2010","Long story short: I LOVE the BART.  I wish we had public transportation like this down in LA.Long story long:Otherwise known as Bay Area Rapid Transit, the BART is such a convenient and reliable means of transportation in and around San Francisco.  Each line reaches to 5 vital areas of the bay.  It goes as far South as Daly City to the Southwest, Fremont to the Southeast, Dublin and Pleasanton to the East, Concord and Pittsburg to the Northeast, and Richmond to the North.  They all run through the city center and covers all the major areas such as SFO, Oakland and its airport, and Berkeley.Each station is laid out slightly differently and even some stations will have multiple access points, but it all leads to the trains below.  Early in the morning and late in the afternoon, these trains will be packed with commuting professionals and even students.  Depending on which station you're at and the line, a train will come every few minutes.  As long as you're going to a station that serves multiple lines, you can hop on either train.This isn't the first time I've used the BART.  I've used it a few times over the years whenever I've been in the bay area, but my most recent trip, I relied HEAVILY on the BART to get me in and around town.  Fares are really cheap and you can purchase a $20 ticket that will most likely get you through the day depending on how many times you're in and out of the train.  When I drove up from San Jose to SFO, I purchased a $20 ""all day pass"" that took me into town so I could check into my hostel, then used it to get to Berkeley, going in and out a couple more times, then one last time to get back from Berkeley after dinner, and I still had a couple dollars to spare.  The next day, I just took that ticket and reloaded it with another $20.  That was enough to last me the remaining 1+ day I was in town.The stations themselves aren't the cleanest or the nicest, but they're relatively safe during the day.  I probably still wouldn't recommend traveling alone late at night if you are a woman.  The tunnels are virtually empty and well, you can never be too careful in a place like that.  Not to say you should fear for your life, but as some people say, ""better safe than sorry"".The stations in town are probably the best because they drop you off at some key places.  Embarcadero station drops you off 2 blocks from the Ferry Building, and the red line stops right in Downtown Berkeley.  It really is a prime example of convenience.  It's definitely much cheaper than taking a cab all over town.  Combine the BART with all the walking I did, it was a great way to get around town.I wish we had public transportation that was this reliable and convenient down here in LA.  Trust me, I've taken the metro and it's not as convenient as BART.I will always continue using the BART whenever I'm in the bay",bart

I have easy access to, people to see, and things to do, in every major city destined to fall into the Pacific Ocean. I hit SF, SD, PDX, and LA at least once a year now that I get every other weekend to MYSELF (yay divorce and joint custody!)What sets SF apart from all these other cities? NO MOTHER FUCKER IS WILLING TO PICK MY ROYAL ASS UP FROM THE AIRPORT. Ok, so 99% of my friends here don't have cars - BUT STILL, they can be rented.

And I really don't like hauling all my shit around with me through crowded city streets - it makes me all off balance and I'm tippy - I'll just fall right over.

Immediately I remembered the last time I was on BART...I think I was 16 visiting, my step-g-parents in Orinda. I was given a pile of money, dropped off at the BART station and sent on my merry way. I remember being excited to be sent off to explore on my own, at the prospect of maybe scoring some freaking drugs in the big city and to ride the fancy NEW train (yes it was 1986....  :/) I am fairly certain the first thing I did when I sat down on the train was put on my headphones and settle in...I am fairly certain the TAPE in my WALKMAN was U2 - Unforgettable Fire.I spent that day wandering around, smoking, getting all hopped up on Cherry Cokes and Suzie Q's, wishing I could lay hands on some pot, finding ""Jumping Jack Flash"" playing in some sketchy theater on Market and being amazed that people were SMOKING IN THE THEATER (which I, of course, joined in), and being a punk kid from a much smaller city semi-overwhelmed by my surroundings.As I remember this, I update my Facebook status to:Nancy B.: The last time I rode BART I was listening to U2 on my WALKMAN. ( I should have added that BART was also still shiny and new back then, like I was. I hate having status update regret....)Friend immediately chimes in: See? If you had taken a cab, you wouldn't have gotten to have that memory.FINE.I still felt like a fucking pack horse walking from the friggin' station to my hotel and I was nearly tipped over like A MILLION TIMES.Rapid tranist is nice, can't wait til the year 2065, when we finally have it going on in Seattle....",bart

After the women disembark, the driver briefly chit-chats with them (it's like a little love fest).The 3 women were happy to see each other, and the driver is happy to be working.Anyway, the driver was asked about the negotiations:""They [management] haven't come up with a darn thing.They haven't budged.At all."" (The driver was visibly agitated and upset, like my wife when I forget to put the seat down. o_O)I take the driver's comments with a grain of salt (many reports indicate that at least some progress has been made).I also don't sympathize with BART employees.Still, I echo her frustration in this regard:""How long are we going to play this game?""Yes, indeed.This situation has caused me a fair amount of uncertainty and stress, and I know that I'm far from being alone.There needs to be a resolution, and quick.The lesbian has been looking hotter than ever lately (thank you, dear).That will comfort me a little this week as another countdown continues.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJCrb1oNbH4",bart

There are kids on the train! It's a family friendly environment. You should get kicked off BART.""After that, somebody was called ""Jeremy Lin"" (he wasn't happy about it, but the guy did look like a shorter version of him).There were then some marijuana references.I was a bit nervous at first (I think a lot of the fans knew each other, but I didn't realize this until the marijuana references were made), but after that I began to chuckle.Still, I was happy when the fans cleared out (I was able to sit down).1 star for very smooth driving.1 star for the big boobed blonde (my eyes will never be the same again).An honorable mention to the guy she was with.

It's truly been filthy lately.On another note, about 10 days ago the man in front of me swore at the one coming out. I stayed put for a few minutes (the second man was slow too, and I had to hold it so that I could catch my train), and am glad that they didn't come to blows (the man who came out lingered around awhile).For 5 weeks this year, I had to pay to park. The $1 fee isn't bad, and it was easy to use the parking machines (I always took my receipts- many riders don't). I would often catch early trains so that I could beat the traffic (driving to the station and finding a good parking spot would have been a chore otherwise), and the only challenge at times was to remember my parking space number. I appreciate the female agent who is sometimes around in the mornings.She works hard and often dresses like a Pussycat Doll (her legs are very sexy). There are really a lot of annoying riders (my friend Nicole rides BART too, and we were just talking about this a few days ago).Just this morning, a girl kept brushing my legs with her bag (I kept adjusting my feet, and ended up kicking a guy a little).Another one bumped into me at one point because she wasn't holding on well enough (she sort of apologized, but not really).Another fool a few yards away was listening to his music too loud.I'm still comfortable riding on BART, but I have grown weary of certain things.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGXi69UmdeQ",bart

You might be waiting 20 or more minutes for a late bus.+Being at some stations gives me the creeps, but I have always felt safe while on the trains.+It's fairly easy to study or sleep while on a train.+Some hot women ride the SF trains, and a few others ride Richmond and Fremont trains (I didn't mind when this woman brushed against me recently).+/-Clipper cards make it a bit easier to enter and exit a station.

When the Fremont train I was on finally cleared out, I got stuck next to some loud Red Sox fans (it was a bizarre night).-In May 2008, an electrical fire occurred at the Hayward yard (it's between the Union City and Hayward stations). Service to 3 stations was disrupted for months. The Fremont and Richmond trains were also more packed than ever during peak hours. It was just a nightmare. The only good thing is that some riders gave up on BART.-Some delays are caused by suicides or accidents (ex: Hayward BART station: ""On October 30, 2010, a man in a wheelchair fell onto the tracks and was hit by a train, dying 2 weeks later from his injuries"").-Gate problems (ex: tickets sometimes get stuck).-There are no late night direct trains to Fremont.-There's no service after midnight on the weekends.  -Ticket prices go up every 2 years, and have been high for 15 years now. -The Fremont and Richmond trains need to be longer during peak hours (9 or 10 cars, not 6-8). I'm tired of being on crowded trains (it's especially bad if you're in a car that's not air conditioned).I sent BART an e-mail 4 years ago, and the response I received was weak.Some changes were made later, but they involved SF trains (they were also lame).-Annoying riders.*Riders on their cell phones (ex: one morning, this frantic woman was pleading with her man not to dump her).

Sadly, most riders are gutless (I was surprised this week when a woman told 2 loud teenagers to be quiet).*Riders soliciting (ex: selling candy; CD's). 16 years ago, I bought a cheap gold chain (I was into them at the time). Just recently, a guy was selling meat pies. Say what?  I'm polite when someone asks, but I really feel like saying, ""No, I don't want to buy your shit.""*Riders just being rude.

330,1,"Sep 30, 2007","BART does so many positive things. It stimulates the local economy, boosts the immune system, teaches you time management, and has a few valuable safety lessons hiding in the package it presents to the general public. Let me explain how.....I assume the local economy must be getting a boost because every other major city I have been to with a public transit system is less expensive. Maybe the money is going to the high paid officials but I can only assume that they spend money, so hooray for all of us public transportation takers funding their fine dining and luxury goods habits. You clearly have to be building up your immune system when you are exposed to the multitude of germs crusted onto the upholstered seats that have not been cleaned since 1972, when BART first opened.You have to have a good sense of time management to make sure you make the last BART train back to where you came from by midnight. Forget the fact that you will have to leave all of your friends who are still having a good time, this is about responsibility, damnit! Safety lesson #1. If you are standing at a BART station make sure you are very aware of your surroundings, because security is not present most of the time. Safety lesson #2. Learn that if you want to stay out past 11:30 it is important not to drink with your friends. You will need to drive home, an activity best tackled sober.Safety lesson #3. Some people will not adhere to safety lesson #2, so be a very careful driver, lest a drunk person ram you off the road. Yep, thanks BART for really stepping up and being there for us. You are the BEST!!!!",bart

And that's with the iPod going.I have a lot of revelations and thoughts about life, the world, existence, yadda yadda yadda...Don't get me wrong, coming from a state that has only one form of public transit *cough*TheBus*cough*, it's very fast, it's efficient, and it's USUALLY on time.  HOWEVERThe worst realization to have while sitting on BART:""They don't actually....*wash* the seats...do they.""Funny how much denial your brain can be in for a couple of months.  This is what it progressed from.""I'm sure they clean these seats. I mean just because I don't see it doesn't mean it doesn't happen""Turned into""So they walk up and down the aisles and pick up paper. I hope that's not all they do.""Which eventually, after a couple of months, has finally turned into.""No. They don't actually wash the seats.""and then of course the further epiphany that would make my Art History prof proud:""Now I know why that one guy stands all the way from Millbrae to the East Bay.""",bart

333,2,"Jul 22, 2011","I was torn between giving BART two or three stars, and I decided to give it two, because although it has gotten me to work on time almost every day for the past year (only late twice because of BART), I have a few complaints about BART.   As plenty of reviewers have mentioned, the seats and the trains with carpeting are FILTHY!  There was an article that came out a few months ago about a scientist from SFSU who tested the seats on the seats and found NINE types of bacteria lurking there, including MRSA.  Oh, and she said some of those bacteria are there because she found fecal material as well.  WOW.  This is why when I fall asleep on BART I never, ever, ever put my head back on the seat.  And even when it's super hot in there, I refuse to take my jacket off so my bare skin doesn't touch the seats or the armrests.  I am also getting sick of the broken escalator situation, specifically at the Civic center station.  Really?  The escalator up to street level was out for almost a month, and the down escalator going to the trains is currently broken and has been for over month.  I pay $10.60 round trip every day.  300,000 people use BART every day.  Where is all that money going?  Clearly it's not going to cleaning the seats or repair and maintenance of the stations.  Oh, I forgot to mention, the Monday after Gay Pride weekend, the Civic Center station was a freaking MESS at 6:30am.  There was garbage everywhere and the floors were disgusting.  You'd think after an event like that they would have had a crew working all night to clean up the aftermath.Although I am grateful to have the option to take BART to work and the Bay area really is very lucky to have a transit system that reaches far and wide and is quite convenient, I wish they would invest more time and energy into upkeep of the trains and the stations.Now after writing this review I need to go disinfect the shoes I wore yesterday and wash my jacket.",bart

I would agree that the aesthetics leave something to be desired, but the actual service is great!

But it wasn't a big problem, as I just asked a very nice transit employee and he indicated which stop would be mine. The STL Metro folks are not this helpful. Or clean!For $8.60 (compared to probably a $40 cab ride), BART got me to my destination, no problem. My only complaint is that I had to lug my suitcase up several flights of stairs once I got to my stop, as the escalators were out of order. Damn! That was definitely my workout for the week... And I decided to take a cab from BART to my hotel, as I my sense of direction is lacking and I didn't want to wander around SOMA with a giant pink suitcase :)When I return to San Fran in a few weeks, I will take BART again fo sho!",bart

I'm not an avid bart rider so when I politely ask a question please be civil enough to respond with a polite answer!!! And have the respect to at least look at me when talking.

342,4,"Oct 14, 2014","Wowza at some of the more negative reviews, since maybe I got lucky and got a good impression of the system during my San Francisco spring trip? Ah well.My impression was that the system was pretty clean, cleaner than the 'L(Chicago's subway), and just about all the employees I dealt with were friendly, including the worker at San Francisco Airport station that showed me how to use the ticket machine. Inside of the cars always felt clean to me, and I can believe older reviews that the seats must've been refurbished on the vast majority of cars within the last 2-3 years. Since I didn't once encounter a dirty seat, and I think I can safely assume you should not take as seriously the much older reviews about the cleanliness inside the railcars, before 2011 or 2012.Maybe one day the system will be 24/7, since that's an unfortunate negative to an otherwise great system. I'm not bothered by the varied distance fares either(rather than flat fare regardless of how little or far you ride), since I know that helps to pay for the cost of this system. Something makes me think the claim that 'the system has to shut down on overnights to do maintenance/etc.', but if other systems can run 24/7 and run less frequent service, that they could still get away with some sort of very minimum service(like every 20-30 minutes?).Ranting aside about the lack of overnight service, I'd totally be comfortable with riding BART again, whenever I return to San Francisco. It did allow me to do a trip over to the University of California-Berkeley's campus, and to and from SFO airport after all.",bart
343,5,"Mar 5, 2008","When I think about going to the airport, I instantly get a headache. I'm sure this has to do with the fact that having lived in LA all my life, the two main options were Burbank (easy peasy) or HELL-AX (um, does that name need any further descriptions to get the point across??). Now with that preconceived panic attack waiting to happen, it was no surprise to me yesterday while waking up at 6am, that I was a little anxious about taking the MUNI to the BART to SFO for the first time.The MUNI was easy since I take that into work and I know the drill there. The BART however, well, I'm still kind of a newb. But I got off the MUNI at Montgomery and paid my $5.45 fair for a ticket to SFO and then headed downstairs with big ole over-packed suitcase in tow and looked for travel clues. I spotted a map and realized that this was going to be easier than i thought. It was just one train, sweet!I then grabbed a seat and people watched until the SFO BART whizzed up and on I got. From there, well, from there, I didn't have to use my brain once. Do you realize what a luxury that feeling is at 8am. i don't know about you, but my brain doesn't wake up til more like 10:30am, so this was a true treat. The total trip took maybe 30-35 minutes and I didn't have to deal with directions, off ramps, traffic or anything. And it was only $5.45.I swear, this city is getting cooler by the day!

Personally, I think that a little union-busting is way past-due.I must admit to a little BART bias, dating back to when I still lived in SF. I still haven't forgotten the lovely station agent at Civic Center from several years ago who ignored the thug who mugged me right in front of her little kiosk, then got snotty when the BART police asked her to give me a ticket to get home and she refused, telling me, ""Just because you lost your money and can't afford a ticket isn't MY problem.""  A Muni agent DID give a pass to get home when she came over to see if she could help, which gave the ""compassionate"" BART station agent an even worse attitude.There are more BART employees getting fed up with union ""leadership"" each and every day, who don't WANT to be on strike.

Your BART riders have, for the most part, taken HUGE hits in hours worked, many working for far less money than just a few years ago (myself included), and medical coverage contributions (if fortunate enough to have them) are unaffordable for many, or eat up as much as a third of take-home pay for those with families.Because of your little hissy fit, traffic will be a nightmare to the nth degree, many people will again have to decide between buying food or paying ridiculously jacked-up parking fees in San Francisco (to be jacked up even higher by some of the opportunistic parasites who run these parking garages and public lots..never let a good crisis go to waste). Some people may not be able to get to work, period., especially the people who can least afford it.Oh, but BART is making money, so they should give you guys what you want? At what cost? It already is not cheap to take public transit from the East Bay into parts of San Francisco. Who in the hell do you think the cost of your overinflated salaries and benefits are paid for by? The very people you are screwing over who are barely making it.Since you are going to inconvenience everyone, at least earn your strike pay.

In this day of many people working reduced hours as it is, you will basically be robbing this people. Those who do have cars will get to sit in traffic for hours, burn $4.00+ a gallon gas, pay bridge tolls they ordinarily don't have to pay, and if they are extremely lucky, find parking that will not sap their food budget for the week. What about those people who don't own a vehicle? Do you think AC (if they don't join your hissy fit) can accommodate everyone? Oh, they can take the ferry? Yep, that's cheap, huh?

348,2,"Jan 6, 2009","Ok, so I like that the bay area at least HAS a rapid transit program. And I've seen some seriously entertaining moments on the various trains. And some seriously disturbing moments. However. The BART service in SF is so limited, that you can't even begin to compare it to Boston's MBTA or New York City's subway network. BART can get you to SF's embarcadero, financial district, downtown center, and the mission. If you want to go anywhere else in the city, be prepared to extend your travel time significantly as you navigate the Muni trains (which are chillingly notorious for running down pedestrians) or the bus system. Yes, you can get to the games and concerts in Oakland. Yes, it's probably great for commuters who truck into the city from Livermore, Richmond, and Pittsburg. However, as a public train that tries to boast the most convenient coverage around...I can't get behind it. I know I sound like a curmudgeon, but I have a love/hate relationship with the BART system. I am also irritated that they splash around advertising as an alternative to driving when going into the city on weekends. When I have dinner at a friend's house, I don't want to feel pressured to get back to the station by 12am. When I'm out dancing or drinking (or both), I don't want to be constantly sweating whether or not I'm going to wind up footing a $60 cab ride back across the bay. I know times are tight, and I'm sure there isn't a huge populous just waiting to work the night shift at BART...but I think it would drastically reduce the percentage of DUIs in the bay area if they did. And speaking of times being tight, what the hell is up with your constantly raising fares?  I see no difference in scheduling or cleanliness of the trains or stations, but still the ridiculous fare hikes.  Not accounting for parking, it is actually cheaper to DRIVE into the city from Oakland than it is to take BART.  So what gives?  Knock it off!  Talk about reducing the incentive for people to take public transit.And carpeting on public transit? That's just a bad idea. Alright. I'm done. Call me an asshole and call it a day.

Also the name of my annoying little brother!"" I loved it! :-)Anyways, BART has been my lifeline back when I was growing up in Antioch and when I was living in the city. In fact, I commuted every other day on BART during the summer of '05 when I was newly hired as a lab assistant for a biotech company in South San Francisco. Yay for being able to relax, sleep and read like 10 books that summer during my commute. My only gripe: parking at Pittsburg!

351,4,"Aug 25, 2007","Lets face it people...BART IS DIRTY. The blue seats and carpet PROBABLY HAVEN'T BEEN CLEANED since they were installed 15+ years ago. Trust me on this, I remember when this happened. It was a refreshing thing at the time, considering the mucky brown dirty seats/carpet they had previously installed. At least those mucky brown seats CAMOUFLAGED all the dirt and stains. Nowadays, it's the DIRT and STAINS that CREATE a camouflage pattern on the seats.And quite honestly, I hate having to take public transportation. It can get quite GHETTO, especially in San Francisco. I'll admit... I'm spoiled, with a car. Can you blame me if my ass prefers to sit on leather seats rather than dirty, stain infested seats compliments of our local government?So I only take public transportation if I need to, like when I don't have my car because it's in the shop (like it was this past week) or when I have to go downtown to work, because I can't park downtown and pay $25 bucks a day for parking.That's just ludicrous. Anyways, I digress.HOWEVER, I have recently acquired a new found respect for BART. Why? You ask...It is EFFING FAST!AND it is reliable, runs on time LIKE CLOCKWORK without breaking down, creating a delay or backup on the rails. Unlike MUNI, which is a joke.So this past week, a coworker (who explained to me how quickly we could get from the Embarcadero station and into the Mission) and I took a quick joyride on BART during our lunch break and over to 25th and Mission to have our tacos at La Taqueria with PLENTY of time to sit down and eat, then hop next door to Dianda's for a slice of cake and back to work in 59 MINUTES!5 stars for being like a good one night stand, FAST AND EASY and for letting me have my cake and eating it too! Now, THAT'S how i like it!Minus 1 star for making me go home feeling dirty and like I have to wash my hands and dry clean my clothes every time I ride it. Like a bad one night stand.

It's been several years since we've been to Boston though, so I'm no longer feeling that anger.  We use BART in a very limited way, mostly to go to San Francisco to the theatre, and for that it works well.

SUPER convenient to The Coliseum. Side note: does anyone else use BART as a verb? In a sentence: ""We parked our car in Fremont, BARTed in to Oakland, and made it to the game in no time."" We had a couple of very nice young men help us (me, Husband, PickyEater and her two small kids) find our way to the correct train one night after we had jumped on the wrong one after a late A's game.

After being plied with margaritas and not much food, my non-Yelp friend, who will rename nameless, dumped me on BART! Thank goodness this nice prostitute befriended me and was helpful enough to guide me home. I had embarked at the Embarcadero station, traveling in the wrong direction towards Burlingame. Thankfully my newly made ""friend"" was headed to the East Bay because if it weren't for her, I'd probably still be lost in the Peninsula somewhere. Anyways, she was really sweet, and helped direct me onto the correct east bound Richmond train. And the sweetheart, god bless her short skirt and low cut top, was so generous, she told me if I went back to her place to meet her Pimp, he would be happy to drive me home.

365,4,"Jun 3, 2009","Bay Area Rapid Transit aka, BART exceeds MUNI in almost every way. Almost because they are experiencing a gradually worsening cleanliness problem.I'll address that first. The uncleanliness isn't really as much litter from food or drinks, but soiling from you probably don't want to know what. Due to budget constraints, BART has cut back on custodial staffing, thereby exasperating the situation. Their peddling Peet's Coffee at several stations & considering allowing drinks on the trains (provided you use their shoddy, poorly designed ""spill-proof"" mugs) will not help things.On the bright side, BART is mostly on schedule (unlike MUNI, they actually HAVE a schedule, not an ""estimate""). And unlike MUNI, their operators (they don't like the term driver) seem to actually grasp the notion of customer service & convenience. For instance, they try to connect you, ala SF-bound trains waiting for transfers at McArthur Station after direct trains stop running.A MUNI driver will more likely make SURE you do not connect. Seriously. Although BART plans to raise fares yet again, it'll still be cheaper for a tourist (or non Fast Pass holder) tp ride from Embarcadero Station to Civic Center Station after both transit systems' proposed rate increases. Yes, it'll cost more to ride MUNI than BART for the same distance. BART provides their own police who hold full police powers. Some stations along their routes are visual sights. Examples are the SFO  & Millbrae Stations.",bart

370,3,"Aug 14, 2006","God, where do I start. 1.) I take serious issue with the magnetized ticketing system imposed by BART. While thankfully in the last 5 years they have discovered something known to most of us as a credit card, they are still behind the times. Regular users should get a key chain transponder. No, I'm serious, just like fasTrak you should have an online account and a little thingy that beeps when you walk past. It should be attachable to your keys or purse just to make digging in your bag and therefore exposing yourself to robbery a thing of the past. Also, we could hook it into MUNI and the SF Buses and AC transit. WOW, what a thought! 2.) Bart, I don't care if you list 10 bazillion reasons why you can't run on the weekends late, but whatever they are, they are dumb or a cover for the fact that your union is twisting your arm. Frankly, I think SF cities need to pass a law that says public transportation needs to be open until 3 on Friday and Saturday nights. The fact that people still need to drive after drinking is freaking retarded. Anyone want to start getting signatures? 3.) Your computer system is ridiculous. Who thought of the idea of having a finite number of trains. When you installed the SFO stop, the trains now have to LITERALLY switch over to a new system. Don't you guys plan ahead? I honestly can't believe you didn't think of getting new computers before now. I'm telling you, you pay your drivers too much if this is why. 4.) I am uber annoyed by stupid jerks standing in the way of the doors. I personally like the new marking system you have, but you need to do a better job or clearly stating what travel etiquette is. Also, have some staff at the platforms during rush hour to make Barters behave. I know, police state, but pushing and shoving is just stupid. (You assholes know who you are). 5.) I honestly think 511transit.org trip planner is really really annoying.  Why the heck can't you see where the address of the various Bart tunnels are? A map included in the interactive system would sure be nice. Ever heard of using google? I mean, what if you need a pick up. Or don't know where you are going to be. So dumb that I have to google it.

Even though you share the same name as one of my idols growing up (Bart Simpson) I gotta compare you to the CTA in Chi-town which you fall very short of. While your pretty convienient,,and much cleaner than the majority of other mass transit systems your still just a mass transit system.

When I do take a seat, I wash my hands and change my clothes as soon as I get home. Granted, I'm a bit sensitive to germs, but the cloth seats and carpets are gross gross gross!BART also needs to invest in building a parking lot for the popular stations in East Bay. I would actually take BART everyday to work, if I could get a monthly parking pass at the nearest BART station. Unfortunately, MacArthur and Rockridge stations are both sold out. Taking a bus to BART isn't really a viable option, since it will add another 20 - 30 min to my commute.I do give  BART credit for extending to Millbrae where Caltrain transfer is possible. Now, if only they could time the transfers better, I would actually be able to transfer. I've had to sprint from BART to Caltrain and nearly miss the Caltrain too many times. If you have to stop and buy a Caltrain ticket or if you are unable to run, then you would surely miss the transfer.It's terribly outdated, but it's still the most reliable and fastest transportation method we have in the Bay Area.

Since BART is losing customers because of these items they say it has their attention. The train is often like a rolling homeless camp,  no improvement.  The stations have very limited security in terms of either security lights or security people, no improvement.  They did a big advertising campaign to say they will crack down on fare evaders, no improvement.  Many regular folks are scared to park and ride at the existing stations so no wonder the customer drop-off.   Of course, this has been a long time with no major action so I am expecting BART will want a tax increase or fare raise to offset their shrinking revenue instead of just getting to work at the stations.

West Oakland is just one stop to the financial district,  Rockridge is full of million dollar homes.  I think BART should have a security guard and cleaning person at all major urban stations like these.  Around the world at major transit stations you see these attendants,  you usually see only one attendant here.

Who new that Vanessa Williams would age so badly?We went back to BART and this man with a duffel bag began to stare at us. He was so creepy....like Chester the Molester creepy.  The train came and we got in.  So did he.  He sat facing us and staring with his bag on his lap. At the next stop I grabbed my friend and we ran off the train and up the escalators to the bathrooms.  We sat in the bathroom for about 15 minutes thinking that he would have left the station when he didn't find us. We got out and were about to go back down onto the platform to go home but then we saw him coming up the escalator. Instead to went to the phones and called my friends older sister.

He was a small indifferent man...I new he wouldn't care if I told him some creepy guy was following us.Her two sisters finally arrive!

The trains are old and ghetto; the cloth seats are revolting and stained and constantly emitting the combined stench of piss, puke, and farts; it appears that nobody ever cleans the damn things.  I just got back from London and rode the Tube there a LOT....so I know that it IS possible to keep cloth seats clean because none of the Tube seats were all that gross.  2)  It doesn't go everywhere in the city.  Just one straight line from the south end to the Embarcadero basically.  So if you want to get to, say, Golden Gate Park, you've gotta think of something else.  I hate public transportation and draw the line at BART, so what other options there are, I don't know.3)  It shuts down too early on the weekends.  It's like they're saying ""Hey guys, how about you drive drunk??""  BART stops running before the bars close.  Maybe that's their lame attempt at reducing puke on the trains, but it sucks because if you miss your train, you're looking at one hell of a hefty taxi fare to get home if you live on the peninsula or something.

You can see grease-stains on the tops of the seat-backs where dirty people have rested their heads/necks.  They should call it BARF, not BART.  Seriously guys, take a cue from other cities with better public transportation systems -- use plastic seats that are easier to clean and less likely to raise healthy thriving colonies of fecal bacteria!!  Did anyone see that news article about the culture tests they ran on the BART seats?  Absolutely horrifying.  Fecal bacteria is just the beginning of it.Next, the trains are SO LOUD.  I guess there isn't much they can do about that though....right?  I'm not a mechanical engineer so I have no clue.Last, I wish BART ran later, at least on the weekends.  Seriously, anyone who's done the drunken ankle-busting foot-race along Market Street trying to find the one station that's still open so you don't have to cough up $50 for a cab ride to SSF on a Saturday night should feel me on this.

I don't understand why something like that isn't a priority to the city.On the positive side (yes I CAN be objective, sheesh), it's cheap and easy (hey kinda like my sister).  As for the SSF station specifically, it's nice & big and relatively clean.  Easy to navigate, and the parking is pretty convenient.

They continue to raise ticket prices while lowering service.  Crazy stinky homeless people are allowed to sleep on the cars.  BART does nothing about it, but why should they?

406,3,"Nov 14, 2012","In many ways this San Francisco people mover resembles the L.A. Metro or even the London Underground, except for the fact that riding BART costs more than either of them (especially when you pick up a $5 Metro day pass or utilize a London Oyster card/travelcard, etc). I'm completely lost on why, when traveling in a group, friends will insist on taking the BART into the city, even with a car available. From Millbrae to, say, Embarcadero and back is almost $10. If there are 4 of you, that's $40 to go 16 miles and return. I suppose the one major benefit is not worrying about parking. On the plus side, BART trains are more frequent in coming, they have arrival time estimates posted, and they take you to more distant places than MUNI does. With their ticketing system, you don't have to fumble with getting your card out to show hounding conductors or negotiate with drivers over whether or not you were within the time limit on your transfer. In short, convenient (sometimes), but not cheap.",bart

Closing hours.  Midnight?  Really?  DC closes later on weekends and Holidays.  That makes sense.2. The weird Richmond/Fremont train closing thing.  I just don't understand it.  Why?  Surely there's a better way of handling it3. The website.  The BART website needs to be fixed.  The directions for loading the maps/schedules onto iPods are completely unclear (at least for me on my Mac).  The trip planner is not intuitive.

I walked 5 blocks out of my way tonight because I don't go into the city often and I'm new to town.  5 blocks.  5.

I swear that some of the trains have not been refurbished or reupholstered since BART started running in the early 70's.  Hence the grease stains on the backs of the seats.  (Why anyone would rest their head on the backs of those seats, I will never know.) I used to take BART into the City when I was in high school to escape suburbia.  Now I still take it to escape suburbia, but I take it to go to work.  I would choose BART over driving to work any day.  I live about a mile from the Concord station so I get a nice walk to & from BART every day.  Sometimes I don't drive for weeks at a time.  After commuting by car for 10+ years I am glad to finally let someone else do the driving.  Just give me my seat by the window so I can gaze outside & listen to Howard Stern.

412,2,"May 23, 2008","Dear BART,I have stood by you, vouching for you, loving you despite your vomit-stained floors, something-gross-stained chairs, shady customers, and your rising prices. I stood by you when I lost my ticket and had to pay another $6 or so in cash to exit the station, asking some poor random guy for a quarter because I had none. I stood by you even though you have that silly ""No food or beverages"" sign. I even stood by you when the dude sitting next to me started jacking off.Now last week, you made me pretty mad. It was your fault too. I know that sometimes your trains catch on fire and what not--they work very hard and all. But I was very troubled when I sleepily opened my eyes on the Richmond--Fremont train and found that I was still in San Leandro though I should be 5 minutes away from Fremont by now. Then I became even more flustered when I looked at the electric sign and saw that I was now on a Richmond train, rather than a Fremont train.I promptly ran out and gave my friends a call, because I would surely be late for our trip to Monterey. Then I found a Fremont train in relief...until you evacuated us at the next stop, forcing us to wait 15 minutes for the next Fremont train while this one turned into a Richmond train, like the last, going the opposite way. Why did you do this? I am just lucky that I realized the train-transformation before I found myself back in Berkeley again. Thank you for lengthening my commute from 50 minutes to an hour and a half. After that experience, I dare not rest my eyes again on your trains.(no there was not a fire that day)From your once loyal customer.",bart

Moreover, the station lighting is extremely dim - I was riding early morning and literally could not see anything due to the filthy glass and the third world type station lighting.Second - every time I take BART, I cannot believe how expensive the ride is.  How come in Seattle you pay $2.50 for the same or greater distance?  How come BART does not sell discount tickets at the vending machines?

417,3,"Jan 7, 2011","When I'm visiting a new city, I like to ride the public transit as close to the time I'm entering that city as possible. There's something about the public transit in another city that just screams ""ADVENTURE!""  (Okay, maybe it's more of a mild shriek).As I walked towards the hotel shuttles and cabs, I kept seeing signs for ""BART"". Being that it was my first trip to SF, I had no clue what a BART was. Honestly, all I could think of was The Simpsons. The more sensical part of my brain kept telling me what a ludicrous connection this was. I'm glad I've learned to listen to it.Turns out BART is the Bay Area Rapid Transit system. Walking upto the platform, I read the instructions on how to buy my ticket. Back in Calgary, we have a flat fair to ride. It'll cost you $2.75 CDN to go from one end of the city to the other. Here in SF, it's a different price for each stop. The fares were listed on a printout taped up inside of a page protector next to the electronic ticket booths. My one way ride was $8.10. I'm not going to complain about the price of the C-Train in Calgary anymore.Buying my ticket was a bit of an unusual experience as well. After reading the instructions on requiring a different fair depending on the stop I was headed to, I figured I'd be able to pick my stop, stick my money in, grab my ticket and be on my way. It was almost that simple, but not quite. Instead, after looking up the cost of the fair on the print out, I then had to stick my money in the ticketing machine and change the fair to the appropriate amount using buttons that added or subtracted $1 or $0.05 at a time. It was a little strange. What happens if you don't put in enough money for the stop you're going to? I'm not sure, and I decided I didn't want to find out.Next step, getting on the train. Calgary trains have a button to press to make the doors open. BART trains... don't. So how do you make the silly things open? I tried everything. I touched the door, I jumped on the black space on the platform that the train car doors lined up with (in case it was some new fandangled space age San Fran train that was weight triggered or something). I even waved my arms up and down in front of the door on the off chance that a motion sensor would open the doors. Nothing. Those doors didn't budge. A gentleman behind me tried pushing on the doors. Nothing for him either. The train sat there for another couple of moments. I gave up and resigned myself to the fact that perhaps I had missed my chance to get on this one (I had bought my ticket after it pulled up after all). Thirty seconds later, the doors opened on their own. After I got on the train and got myself settled, I opened up the map I had grabbed before buying my ticket. Looking at it now, I figured out where I'd need to get off the train to switch over to another train to get to the right stop for my hotel. See, the train I got on was part of the yellow line. The map showed three other lines, and the stop I wanted resided on the red line. I looked closely at my map and saw four white dots all in a row on each line at Balboa. This must be where all four tracks coincide. I would get off there and switch over to the red track.As we pulled into the Daly City station, the operator made an announcement that anyone wishing to switch trains should do so at this station! What?? But it didn't have any white dots on the map! Maybe that didn't matter? I thought it wiser to listen to him and got off the train. I headed for the exit to go find the platform for the red track. I ended up on the platform on the other side, trains on this side were headed back in the direction I came from. Confused, I retraced my steps down the stairs and happened upon the information desk. ""Excuse me, what train will take me to Powell Station?"" I asked the desk attendant. ""Anyone on that side"" she replied as she pointed to the platform I had been on in the first place. Turns out I had pictured a much bigger and more intricate train system than what existed. Sure there are four lines, but there are only two sets of rails. Go figure.BART, your doors and your map tricked me. But your attendant was helpful, and you provided me with my first experience of San Francisco. Not all cities have the benefit of a train that can take you all the way to the airport for under $10, nor does the acronym for their transit system flow so nicely into a one syllable name. We had our ups and downs on that first ride, but overall, you're not so bad.",bart

Cleanliness should be increased. No one likes the smell of urine. 2. More trains should run from 7-9am and 4:30-6:30pm... 15 minutes is too long to wait for a train... 3. talk about robbery... $$$ Its far too expensive to be crammed on a train car like cattle for 35 minutes... An the sad part is BART talks about raises prices... 4. Weekends should have trains running past midnight, it would promote less drunk driving and bring more people into the City... The positives... 1. You can avoid traffic and the extra time it would consume in your day... 2. You don't have to pay the high prices of city parking ;) 3. more environmentally friendly 4. If you are a people watcher, there is quite a show! (wear sunglasses) A few other side notes... some BART locations are now charging $1 for parking, which is unfortunate...

The filthy stains at the back of each carriage lend themselves to the explanation of their own existence. The off-white interior just *feels* dirty, and the architecture of the entire system seems like a horribly, unmodern throwback to the 70s.The frequent delays, the horrendous schedule (seriously, do I really have to wait 15 minutes at a little past 6pm?) combined with the general dark and dank feel, it's hardly the experience you'd want from a post-2000 transport system.It gets you where you need to go (providing that you want to get to somewhere along that one line straight through the city), but you certainly won't enjoy the ride.",bart

440,4,"Apr 17, 2007","I'm a fan of Bart.  As an exMuni-train commuter I've come to appreciate BART - it's regularity, it's orderly lines and soft seats.  So much so that my car sits lonely and dusty on the street.  Happiness to me is letting BART deal with driving, while I read a book.  That being said, to get BART up to 5 stars, here are 5 rules fellow riders need to stick to:1. Walk left, stand right!   If you want to treat the escalator as a ride or are too lazy to walk (I am guilty of this), stand to your right.  Don't block those people running for their trains to get to work on time.2. Have your ticket out as you approach the 'turn-styles.'  You had to put the ticket into the slot to get into BART, what did you think was going to happen when you got off the train?  Don't clog up a gate while you fumble for your ticket either.  You risk getting crushed to death by the ever forward moving throng.  That or just really irritating the person stuck behind yee of the short sight.  3.  Don't have loud cell phone conversations for all to hear, and for the love of god can you get a less obnoxious ring-tone!  I don't need to hear the intimate details of your life, nor do the people in the next train.  I'm sorry you have that outbreak but I hear they have a cream for it.  Now get off the phone, don't touch me, and look-up a 24 hour pharmacy on Yelp!4.  If someone is reading a book, they don't want to talk to you.  Unless it is a trashy romance novel.  They might be lonely.5.  Don't hold the doors open.  BART is sensitive, it likes to breakdown.  If you hold the door open and knock my train out of service I'm going to give you...well a really evil eye at the least (OK the most)  Although, watching people getting crushed in the doors is a personal favorite BART pastime of mine.  Cruel but hilarious.",bart

Some stinky, dirty cars, with an occasional mental wandering/in the car, cars with heaters on hot days, and air conditioners on cold days. Escalator set in the wrong direction for commutes, when they are working. Stiles not set to easy commutes. I'll give them that they are no worse than other public transport. The best thing I could say, is that it is mostly on time.But now, the entitled BART workers are on strike, devastating the daily schedules of hundreds of thousands of people, and costing local businesses millions of dollars. It's as if there had been a terrorist attack shutting down the region's transport, I'm not equating BART workers to being terrorist. No, I'm equating the damage they are causing.Why are they allowed to strike? Why aren't they all fired for wasting the public's time and causing this much financial damage?They're seeking raises? Not willing to pay more for their benefits (like people do in jobs now)?Instead they are holding the public hostage. In a hostage situation, do you give in to the hostage takers, so they can do this to you again?",bart

More than a million dollars has been allotted to add more officers and cleaners. This is great to hear. They also showed 2 BART police officers trying to clear a hallway. It appears this was not at the same time as the citizen's video. I had to laugh. I have never seen a police presence at BART where the trains are and now this. A huge thanks to this one citizen who had it. We all need to do this. This is a huge public safety issue. Even just 1 cop where the trains load or unload at the notorious stations only would help. If I begin to see any police presence I will happily write a positive review. Until then I remain doubtful",bart

There's a huge disconnect in city transportation developers between Philadelphia and San Francisco, but major kudos to the Bay Area for getting it right.The cost to ride is a little on the steep side, but we used it fairly infrequently on our visit. Given that we mostly walked to and from the hotel to all of our touristy destinations, we took the bus more often than rail, but it served us just fine. Schedules were easy to read, the ride was smooth and clean, and figuring out how to get from point A to point B was a virtual no-brainer. For being public transportation it far exceeded any expectations I have ever had for big city travel.",bart

The noise while riding in the cars can get deafening at times. Finding parking in the parking structures can sometimes be hard (especially in the Daly City or Fremont BART stations).Thank goodness I don't have to rely on BART for my commute - but in these days high gas prices, I won't hesitate in taking BART to SF.",bart

During the several months that I have taken bart, I have seen, heard, and smelled weird things. Today for instance, some person almost sat on me. I have also seen fights, people picking their nose, as well as the homeless panhandling for a cheese burger. Yea, you'll definitely find yourself exposed to awkward, uncomfortable, and strange situations on Bart - without a doubt! The trains are filthy, musty, and germ infested. It's really gross and I'm hoping I don't die from some foreign disease cultivated in those trains. The seats are stained with God knows what, the floors are sticky, and there's always trash tucked along the sides of the seat. They obviously do not spend enough money maintaining the trains or enforcing their ""no food or drink"" rule. Their sliding doors do not stay open for anyone, so beware because I've seen the doors shut on people as they try to slide through, it doesn't open back up like elevator doors, it just squeezes you until you get out of the way. Every aspect of Bart is yucky, but I've learned to accept it, which is why I wear the same ugly jackets all the time, which gets washed every Friday. Bart really deters me from buying new clothes; I mean what's the point? It will just get ruined. Everyday, twice a day, I sit in an awkward position making sure that I don't touch any foreign objects and that my hair doesn't touch the seats. I then go home and take a shower within minutes!! I'm really not a germaphobe but, bart conditions are far from acceptable. Others will probably argue against me, as I have seen people sleep comfortably on the seats, in the fetal position, occupying two seats at once while an elder has to stand!!!!!!!!!",bart
447,2,"Oct 13, 2015","Sure...it gets you from Point A to Point B and serves people without other transportation options. But its a bad experience that absolutely pales in comparison to mass transit system in major cities around the world.  BART is a poorly planned linear system that leaves populated areas of the Bay Area poorly served.  There aren't enough cars to provide service even as it is due to BART's poorly managed financial condition and the cars on the track are generally very overcrowded.  The trains itself sound like they are about to fall apart as they rattle down the ancient tracks and the interiors are filthy and appear to go uncleaned for months.  Windows, seats, floors are all dirty and stained.    The stations are for the most part are dirty, depressing concrete monoliths that reflect the institutional, unimaginative utilitarian architecture of the late 1960s and early 1970s.  Many stations and parking lots are dangerous after dark.  Worst of all, BART management seeks to stick taxpayers with new taxes to operate the system in 2016.  Meanwhile, BART will not seek to tax corporations and real estate owners whose property values skyrocketed when BART stations were constructed near their property.  Such assessments are perfectly legal to do under California law and many mass transit systems around the globe provide funding this way.  This funding failure has been studied by planning and transportation professors at UC Berkeley and reported in this article....http://www.eastbayexpress.com/oakland/barts-big-gift-to-wealthy-corporations/Content?oid=3654041BART/mass transit is a public good.

Guess what BART? Restricting them to certain times of day is not helping. DEDICATE A WHOLE CAR TO THEM, THEY'RE GETTING ON MY NERVES WITH ALL THE SPACE THEY TAKE UP.Us BART riders can complain and complain until our faces turn colors, however, the simple fact is that we need it, AND we will keep riding it.

Many days, bart is horrible and cannot take you to where you want to be as quick as you want to get there, for a myriad of stupid reasons. These usually include: 1. ""We are experiencing problems with the train/track and will have to wait an eternity on the track until some idiot figures out what happened.""2. ""The train in front of us has a locked axle and we have to wait until some idiot figures out what happened and unlocks the axle. Hopefully he won't touch the electric third rail and electrocute himself in the process, but if he does, we'll have to wait an additional 30 minutes.""3. ""The train conductor wants to grab a sandwich at the nearby shop at the next station, so until he has some hot pastrami in his hands, we will not be leaving the station.""4. Green fairies are flying around in the front of the train, and we don't want to hit them and stop the magic in this world, so we will be sitting on the tracks for another 10 minutes.5. We need to re-route the train because some hippie event is going on, and we don't want to hit the hippies.Bay area rapid transit? I've always thought it should be something more like Bay area Retarded transit. Or Bay area Ridiculous transit. Bart is incredibly unreliable, so don't count on getting anywhere on time if you take it. Don't get me wrong, many days, you'll get to exactly where you want to be, when you want to get there, and bart is a glorious experience. But on those days where the fairies are partying in the middle of the tracks, well, you'll just have to go with the attitude, ""I'll get there when I get there."" And, ""the fairies are just as important as I am.""",bart

For tourists like myself, BART just makes getting in and out of the city so easy.  My only minor complaints or issues:  Cloth seats, just gross, unless you get a newish car, this can;t be a good idea on rainy days when the seats stay wet all day.  Why are there only 4-5 stops in downtown?  I know the line wraps through the city but there are so many neighborhoods with no subway access and nothing near Golden Gate Park.

457,2,"Jun 16, 2012","BART is... weird. It was originally conceived as a ""train of the future,"" and it does have that sort of futuristic glean to it, with the huge oddly-shaped broad-guage railcars and the strange whirring and grinding noises it makes. It's also very zippy for a US subway system.Then there are these surprising moments of un-modernness, like the lack of automated announcements or LED signs onboard. These trains of the future still have conductors making barely comprehensible announcements. (D.C.'s Metro, which is probably the most similar system to BART, suffers this perplexing anachronism as well.) And man, BART has by far the grossest, filthiest railcar interiors I've ever seen. Those seats! My god, those seats. And the carpeting too (also: carpeting on public transit... really??), which is probably releasing mutant mold spores with every step. It looks like it hasn't been cleaned in at least decade, and the cars smell like--and I'm trying to be kind here--a golden retriever that has just emerged from a swamp. All you want to do is bathe in bleach after you've sat down on one of those things. Nasty, nasty. Odd though, because the stations are actually pretty nice and well-maintained. Not as nice: those farecard vending machines, which actually manage to be more confusing than even Chicago's. Isn't SF supposed to be the technology city? Aren't there any user interface designers that can help out? The thing is, BART wouldn't be too hard to make actually really nice. New seats, new vending machines, and some better signage.

The trains are often very loud and make weird noises.  Why can't we learn from Japan.  BART has spread out more over the years, which is nice.  But prices are high and they don't run late enough.  If they could just run the trains until 3am then all the people coming from the bars could ride the trains.  The stations are usually dirty and many of them don't have bathrooms.  I think BART should be open 24 hours a day and the trains improved.  This time let's do it right,  And take a power washer and wash out those stations for chrissakes.",bart

It was nice not to have to drive, and I got on without wait the first time, but on the way back we timed it wrong and waited fifteen minutes to get on.

483,4,"Jan 20, 2010","BART has its drawbacks. Let's not kid ourselves:- outdated interiors- intense rail noise (especially in the trans-bay tube)- sometimes malodorous cars and/or unknown liquids spilled on the seats- an assortment of drunk, homeless, or mentally ill riders.- people who shriek on cell phones or play what passes as ""music"" from cell phone speakers at max volume.But that said, there are good points too.- It's way cheaper than driving (especially over long distances), and this savings is even greater if you buy your tix with commuter checks.- Though it's subject to delays and problems, the longest I've ever been held up is 20 minutes. Average delay is about 5 minutes. People who drive along 880 during commute hours only wish they had such minimal delays.- If you're going to SFO (especially flying internationally), it's your best ground transportation option.For people commuting to SF from the East Bay (or vice versa), it's an excellent alternative to driving: less pollution, less wear & tear on your car, and far lower costs.And now to kick a hornets nest:Isn't it ironic that Marin County, with all its self-proclaimed progressive, environmentally-conscious liberal residents, refused to have BART expanded there?

484,3,"Feb 28, 2017","BART Worked Reasonably WellWe needed to go from point A to point B, than back again.  It was pretty easy, and we were able to get where we needed go in a timely fashion.  Fortunately, we are pretty experienced when it comes to using mass transit, so we are able to roll with most challenges presented by each system.For people who do not use mass transit often, BART can be a bit challenging.  Getting through the stations is pretty straightforward.  Determining which train is the correct one, however, is not.  Making matters worse is the fact that the trains are not marked on the inside to let you know which train and/or route you're actually using!Now, you may say, ""The announcers let you know all that information.""  I cannot argue for or against that point, despite having heard the announcers at regular intervals.  What I did hear - and I quote - was, ""fwjenlkjf Iwru bkjhsJIOETP FBAmoa njpeahm;l,"" and other announcements that were equally impossible to understand.Bottom Line-If you know your way around mass transit, you'll be fine.If you are new to the experience, don't be afraid to ask staff for help.

490,1,"Mar 31, 2007","[Update: I am currently living in Paris, France. I had to reduce my rating of BART to one star after my experience on the Paris Metro. (Yelp doesn't support the accent over the e, alas. ) Allow me to explain: In Paris a train comes to the station (one can be found within walking distance from anywhere) within 5 minutes, max (usually you will wait three minutes for the next train). It will cost you 1.5 Euros to get anywhere in Paris if you buy a ticket or you can buy a monthly pass for 53 Euros which gives you unlimited rides on the Metro and also gives you unlimited rides on the buses and the RER. Price goes down if you buy the yearly Navigo pass. People who work at the Metro stations are super nice and never have attitudes. (French) riders on the trains are nice, reserved and clean. The trains manage to go incredibly fast without ever creating a screeching noise so loud it almost makes your ears bleed. Also, people in France don't poop on the trains. And, even if they did, unlike on BART here is no rarely cleaned carpet to sop-up, collect and store all the blood, vomit, feces, urine etc. which constitute all those stains on the floor of the BART. I'm sure the carpet on BART was an attempt to find a material to absorb with painful screeching noise - a result of engineers with no knowledge of aerodynamic design.The metro system was built before 1920. The BART was built between 1964 and 1972 -- by then engineers had gotten us to the moon! and even with all the good examples of trains in the world BART planners still couldn't get it right!!!]  Original review: The Best Night Ever for BART was the night the new De Young Museum opened. There was also some bridge construction going on so the BART ran all night long. Even at 3:00 in the morning there were something like 10,000 people on the grounds of the De Young waiting to get in or just hanging out.Coming home to Berkeley at 4:30 in the morning the whole train was packed to the gills. There were hipsters and business people and drag queens and gang-looking kids and college students and distinguished looking seniors all crowded in together returning home from a night on the town. Suddenly the whole car broke out together in a rendition of some song -- I feel like it was Elton John or James Taylor -- something very 70s cheesy AM radio, and it was all so magical.The BART should run all night. I will never understand how this can be a ""World Class City"" when you cannot even stay out until 2am unless you have 40 bucks plus tip to get back across the bay in a hard-to-find taxi, or want to drive drunk. A friend of mine who is really into Railroad History recounted to me a story that the reason BART is such a money pit and cannot afford to (stay running at night, finish looping the bay, charge us compassionate fares, etc.)  is because when it was first designed (the business? the people? the government? I forget this essential fact!) wanted it to be designed so that it could never be annexed by (other?) businesses and used for hauling materials, so they designed the rails to non-standard size and designed cars that couldn't use standardized parts. So everytime something breaks down it has to be specially ordered and manufactured, unlike Caltrain. (sp?) -- If they had just used standardized train parts like NYC, etc. then they could afford to run and charge less. I am willing to believe this story is true until I am confronted with contrary evidence.UPDATE: Go read the Bay Area Rapid Transit page on the Wikipedia - there it outlines the whole story as to what I tried to say above.The Wiki also had this funny note:""Peter Hall, author of the book Great Planning Disasters, describes BART as one of the sensational planning disasters of the 20th century, alongside the Anglo-French Concorde and the Sydney Opera House."" -- ha!On a final downer note, TWO times I have seen coiled piles of actual human poop on the carpet of the BART. I don't know what they clean that carpet with but I hope it is CDC approved.It makes me want to have one of those CDC/Hot Zone/Nasa/Silkwood decontamination showers installed at the door to my house.",bart

He puts his ticket through a bunch of times and the computer won't let him out.  So he starts talking with the attendant about the problem.  The argument was starting to get pretty heated, but thereafter I went upstairs to wait for my train.  Found out it 'twas about 19 minutes away, and I thought that argument would get quite interesting.  I headed back downstairs to observe. The guy is yelling back and forth at the BART lady about how it's bad Karma that she won't let him out of the station.  He still owed some cash on his ticket.  He's yelling at her saying that he's gotta pick up his wife who has a flat tire (he was obviously flambouyantly gay). She finally tells him that she's calling bart police and eventually a bunch of F and C words start driveling out his mouth.  Then he walks away in a huff with his hands on his hips and says ""...annnnnd you have BAD teeth!!!"". He goes to sit down and wait for I dunno what.  Eventually this 300lb thug lookin black dude is like ""hey man, you need a couple bucks, I can spot you"". Flambouyant guy comes over and is sayin ""Oh thank you thhhooooo much give me your card, and I'll mail you a check as soon as I get home"". Thug guy reaches for his wallet, and instead of pullin out a few singles, he smashes the guy in the face with his fist as hard as I've ever seen anyone get hit.  He's like ""yea, that's what chu get for flippin out in my BART station!""  Thug jumps over the turnstyles and hops out of the station. I'm already almost pissin my pants at this point because I'm such a pussy, cowering in the corner and calling 911.  I mean Flambouyant was annoying as hell and quite obviously in the wrong, but I thought he was gonna need to pick up some of his teeth off the ground after that hit. Have you ever called 911?  I got some nice elevator music and the ol ""thank you for your call, you are a valued customer, please wait 25 minutes while we sit here whackin off"".  About 26 minutes later I finally get an operator.  I tell her I just witnessed an assault at the BART station, and there was a guy there that was in serious need of help. Hang on while I dial bart police. More elevator music... At this point, I grab the next train, and the operator finally picks up just before I hit the tunnel into Oakland.  I'm tell her ""look, the emergency is prolly over, but it would be nice if they sent a cop over to Macarthur. Next BART story... I got some news from home and I was overcome with emotion. So I'm really on edge (usually my strongest emotion is hunger -- WHEN i'm not menstruating).  I hop on BART after a 12 hr day and head home.  This skinny urkel lookin guy hops on my train, and starts playing the bongos on the car door with his two pepsi bottles.  I put up with it for a few minutes, then he starts bangin through the aisles with the bottles.  I first glance at him with a ""fuck you"" face, then ask him ""HEY ARE YOU GONNA SHUT THE FUCK UP ANY TIME SOON?????"" He's stops dead in his tracks and says ""WHAT R YOU GONNA DO ABOUT IT"" and waves his hands at himself as if to tempt me to beat his ass. Walk up to him look him square in the eye, nose to nose, and I say ""NOTHING, JUST SIT THE FUCK DOWN AND STOP BOTHERING ALL THESE PEOPLE"".Then I cowered into the other train. GO BART, YOU ROCK!",bart

It's actually my other fellow riders that greatly influence my experience....here are a few of my favorites:1) Gumby - He gets on the last train at the 16th Street and Mission station and immediately starts stretching and dangling his 6'4"" frame from the bars within the train.  This dude always wears his ""warm-up"" gear and a sweatband.  He props his legs up, cracks his vertebrae, etc. and really gets into it.  It's distracting and for some strange reason pisses me off because secretly I wish I could play on the BART jungle gym too and not give a shit, okay?2) Make Up Diva - Gets on BART looking like Sarah, Plain and Tall...gets off looking like Ru Paul. Honey, it's one thing to powder your nose or apply a little lip gloss, but if you've busted out with your vanity table and you're ""tap/swirl/buffing"" (a la Bare Escentuals), it's really fucking tacky. Get up 15 minutes earlier. Or do what I do and keep some makeup at work.3) Left Standers - the fuckers (yes, they ARE fuckers!) who stand on the left side of the escalator when I'm pistoning down trying to catch my coveted and usually-not-crowded 24th Street train.  It's during these times that I really wish pushing people out of the way wasn't illegal.  Yeah, you better believe they get the stink eye and an ancient Chinese curse.4) The Ballers - these are the men (and occasionally women) who stand *really close* to you while you are *sitting in an aisle seat*, so that their groin is generally in the vicinity of your ear/cheek.

507,3,"Sep 16, 2011","You can tell a lot about a city by using their public transit system. In my travels I've noticed that the coolest, most livable and forward-thinking cities have excellent public transit, whereas in craptastic, redneck cities reliable public transportation is decidedly lacking.So where does that place San Francisco's BART system?Although overall I'd rate BART as being satisfactory, there are some aspects that make me want to sing its praises. First of all, I love how the fares are based on the total distance travelled. Unlike some cities that use a zone-based or a flat-fee system, BART allows passengers who are only going one or two stops to pay dirt-cheap fares. It just makes sense. Also, the vast area that BART covers allows commuters from far and wide to ditch their cars and get to their destination _fast_. It's the way of the future, people! Cars just AREN'T sustainable, so we may as well adjust now. But I digress...Why only three stars then? Well, firstly and most importantly, a BART station just doesn't seem like a place an average person would want to be once it gets dark. I'm normally a fairly self-sufficient and confident commuter, but when I was using BART in San Francisco I was convinced that someone would pull out a prison shank on me. The stations are just dark and sketchy. Also on the topic of stations, they didn't seem like they were being maintained properly. In a few cases the escalators weren't working, and I can't begin to tell you how infuriated I was struggling to haul a 75-pound bag up a long flight of stairs. I can't imagine how someone with physical disabilities would fare.Also, as someone who was a visitor in the city and not completely aware of exactly where I was based on sight, I found that the station names were inadequately marked. In most cities I've been in, subway/tube/u-bahn/skytrain station names are clearly marked and visible from the trains; stations are also loudly announced over the intercom systems so you know exactly how far you've travelled. On BART, I often struggled to find out if I was at my destination. In many stations, I saw no signs and although the operators would make announcements, the intercom was both a) muffled and b) drowned out by the screeching rails so I could barely make out a word. Fortunately for BART, this is a relatively quick and inexpensive fix.As a huge advocate of sustainable public transportation I applaud BART for giving Bay Area residents and visitors a reliable transportation system. Unfortunately, to continue to attract new riders and keep existing ones, there's a bit of work that needs to be done.",bart

515,5,"May 8, 2007","Ya ya ya, BART has its flaws. -it could be easier to figure out if you are new to the system-it could be cheaper -it could be cleaner -they could run later -they could run to more areas-they could make the tickets NOT lose their value if you put them in your walletBUT I used it to commute for 5 months before I moved into the city and didn't have any major issues, just slight annoyances and really when I can nap to and from work and not worry about traffic, it is okay by me. I am from souther California and I can not wait for the day LA hops on the public transit train (pun intended). BART, you get 5 stars because:-you run regularly-you get me where I need to be-I don't have to pay for airport parking or taxi's,-you are cheaper then muni when traveling in the city-I can visit my friends in the East Bay and not have to worry about driving -you took my girlfriends and I from Pleasent Hill to Milbrae to go to my brothers football game and allowed us to sleep/passout from drinking on the way back. **THE MOST IMPORTANT***-you gave me a way to keep my whoops with an ex boyfriend from driving me all the way home and having the uncomfortable conversation about why we were not going to get back together! Instead I just had to endure a uncomfortable 5 minute car ride and was able to do the kiss and ""I'll call you"" dash!  THANK YOU!  5 stars!",bart
516,1,"Mar 30, 2009","It is the worst rapid transits I've ever experience. Not to mention the ridiculous limited stations it has, it is dirty and stinks. Why stations only run along Market Street in SF? Why it only runs down to Fremont, not to San Jose? Why do they build a Dublin/Stoneridge station and not a new Livermore station instead? Why are they using cloth seats that absorb stains and odors and hard to clean and replace? Why are they still using this old stupid paper ticket system? Why they always ask for more tax-payers' money but nothing has been improved? Why why why? Comparing to other subway/transits in big cities like NY, DC, Europe, Japan and Hong Kong, BART is the worst! It is a shame to San Francisco and to Bay Area. How can one of the world's famous cities has such a bad and out-dated transit system. Whoever in charge of BART and those decision-makers should be fired or resigned. Look at what other cities offer to their citizens! We deserve a modern, smart, convenience, clean transit system, not BART!",bart
517,3,"Apr 17, 2007","Compared to MUNI, SamTrans, etc, BART is gravy! They keep hiking up the fares every year, but it's still better than the others. It's usually on time, has cops when you need 'em ( some are eye candy), and it's relatively clean. It's rare to see a stinky slobbering passed out bum taking up two seats...well, except for early mornings or in the evenings. ( How in the hell do they get on anyway)? BART is my only  way to work Monday thru Friday. I can just sit back and read, and enjoy the damn ride.

Then we realize we bought tickets for BART but needed to go in the MUNI.  Ok... so we thought it should be ok, right????The attendant at BART told us to go across the hall, literally, they are just a few feet from each other, and speak to the MUNI attendant.  She would not let us in because they are two different systems... what?  Yeap!  You got to pay in cash to use the MUNI but for BART you got to buy a ticket, totally not interchangeable and not refundable.  I found out that there are 3 different transportation systems (third one being CALTrain) within San Francisco and none of their systems speak to each other.... duh?????Why cannot make a system that you can just buy one pass and it works in all of them?  Why have all of these different systems operating within a city, with different personnel, with different forms of payment and it is all an aggravation to the general public?  Double duh....",bart

Hmm...maybe I'll Yelp that too :)  And with all the crazy traffic on the Bay Bridge, hmm maybe I'll Yelp that too :)  I've started taking BART more often because it's comfortable, I get to relax and enjoy a book or people watch and I don't have to deal w/too much stress.  If the BART prices dropped I can honestly say this transit system would surely see an increase amount of people.I love BART!

523,4,"Nov 14, 2007","I see that people here either hate or love BART.  The thing about BART is that, yes, IT IS OLD people.  It's been around since the 1970's and they just have yet to update it.  But I think if they really were to update it, it would cost a lot of money.  And I'm guessing they're just waiting till they really need to renovate it to do so.  Anyhow, the reason why BART is great:1) I can get to San Francisco from Fremont for cheaper than I would if I were to drive (With today's current gas prices + the crazy $4.00 bridge toll)2) I can sit on the BART train and relax instead of driving on the 880.Yeah, BART is kind of noisy and not the cleanest, but it is pretty good in my opinion considering how long it's been around.  I think we are lucky to even have an alternate option to driving and taking a bus (I HATE BUSSES)... And yeah, BART can be ghetto sometimes with the people that ride it, but then you see past that and all of the non-ghetto people, and business people that also ride BART.

527,4,"Mar 4, 2013","I'll throw in my modest two cents about my experience (singular) with BART. Easy, convenient, newbie-friendly.I did absolutely zero research regarding this rail system. Hopped off the plane, decided to give it a try, had about 20 minutes to catch the next train (via info collected from my smart phone), decided to go for it. (Cue Rocky theme song)I found the ticket machines confusing, and I didn't know how to otherwise find out how much to pay/where to get off the train, so I asked the woman working at the information booth. (Conversation with a stranger? Imagine!) She gave me the lowdown in about five seconds, and I was off. (Play Rocky theme song)Dragging my wheeled suitcase behind me, I quickly found a seat in front of a map of the stations, and within a few minutes I was loungin', maxin' and relaxin', reading a book. The train reminded me slightly of a system I took in Amsterdam a long while ago: quiet, comfortable, efficient. I'm sure this isn't always the case, and I saw a few suspect suspects, but I always felt safe. For about eight bucks, it was a perfect way to navigate the San Francisco streets and get a taste of the city. Love BART!",bart
528,2,"Feb 22, 2006","I'm sorry but every time I step past the ticket taking machine I hear that ""get down, get down"" music from Pulp Fiction in my head.  The feeling of 70s funk overtakes me and I expect to see Shaft and a bevy of girls with boas coming down the stairs. Why? Because the BART is still stuck in the 70s, the decor of the stations, the style of trains and its interior, the underground stations are labyrinth, dirty and dark looking.Hey, this is transportation, not a fashion show you say, so okay but the NYC subways get new cars, the DC metro looks like something out of the future yet we get this and somehow this gets rated the best transportation system in the nation.  What a sad statement on public rail in the U.S. is all that tells me.  The service is spotty, it doesn't run until later on the weekends which sucks if you've got a flight.  And flying out of Oakland, well, read my review of AIR BART for that.  If you don't plan for the absolute slowness of BART, AIR BART or both, you will find yourself like me, hailing a cab from the Coliseum station to the airport just to make your flight.

531,4,"Jan 5, 2008","Ok I am totally erring on the side of the BART gods and giving this place a four instead of the 3.5 I'd like to give it. Really I depend on BART a lot (as I do VTA, CalTrain, Light Rail and the occasional jaunt on AC Transit and MUNI but hey who's saying utilizing public transportation is a bad thing). BART is an even contender heading with other Bay Area public transportation systems heading into this review and this is how I decided 3.5 was an adequate star rating:             efficiency: 4 out of 5--BART is usually on time (or within             a reasonable time frame). However, when there's a problem            at one station, there are problems with ALL trains heading in            that direction. unforeseen upside: if this was to happen to your            train under the transbay tunnel you could wind up on the news!            All joking aside, BART is well timed to commuter bus shuttles            and local bus services throughout/leading to 5 counties.             cleanliness: 2.5 out of 5, two things-don't ride the suspiciously             empty car on New Year's Day and hey, it beats MUNI.             comfort level of the trip: 3 out of 5--tip one during commute             hours, if you want to sit, always go for one of the first cars. For            every beautiful sunrise over SF in the wee hours you get five             people screaming on their cell phones, 2 homeless people             talking to you/themselves, 4 teenage girls squealing and one             guy sleeping for what feels like a dozen times over. Still it beats            MUNI.            convenience: 3.5 out of 5--during commute hours all is well. But             there is limited service between the lower East Bay and San             Francisco at night and on Sundays. As some have pointed out            they do close before the bars do, so that can kind of suck.             those creepy voices (the soft robot voice/robot boy voice) and            the flashing minute signs: 2 out of 5. Creepy. Plus when the             attendant or station agent blares across the loudspeaker you            can really detect the rhythm of the electronic voice afterwardsFrom when I use to have a car, I do remember that the parking lots I use to park in (Millbrae and Fremont) were both well lit and quite safe.I also feel like I get more than my fair share of late trains right in a row but that's a whole other story....",bart

Technically there is no food or drink allowed onboard, and if people listened to this then I think it would be great, but people don't listen most of the time, causing messes.  Also, the annoyance of people feeling we need to listen to their cell hone conversations or loud music gets old, but that isn't BART, just rude people.Overall, a great public transit service.",bart
533,3,"Nov 24, 2006","A great big ""eff you"" to BART for expanding to SFO. It created an unholy balance by forming 3 types of trains heading South of San San Francisco. The ubiquitous ""SF Daly City"", nearly extinct ""SF Colma"", and the hated ""SF SFO Millbrae"" now dominate the south of Balboa Park landscape.Do we needed a train to SFO? It's an ok idea, but in my opinion the shuttle thing worked fine. We certainly did not need that hundred million dollar glass and concrete farce we call the SFO station. How many people use the South City and San Bruno stations anyway? You can count them in the tens.And to further drive home a point why even penetrate San Mateo county or take BART to San Jose? Those snobs are not enlightened enough to take public transportation Those prissy princesses are too busy driving around in S.U.V's or taking their beloved Caltrain (like omg! yay caltrain! let's go drink appletinis and shop for Coach bags) too appreciate BART. Effete noveau rich bourgosie bastids! They don't belong in our shining city on a hill!Sorry for turning it into a class war, but I must admit I do get a personal joy when I see a Caltrain rider's face writhe in horror when they enter the BART train. (HA! Go back to Atherton!)The point is: Don't shove BART into places it wasn't mean't to go. Screw the South Bay. They stole the A's and they're a bunch of Prissies anyway. Bart should expand North and east reaching out to the hardworking, taxpaying coutnies of Alameda and Contra Costa. The Richmond line should extend north and connect to Rodeo and Hercules  with a possible link to Vallejo. TONS of people commute from Vallejo and would clear up the northern corridors.That hate tirade aside, I do appreciate the SF Richmond line (or as I like to call it ""the Blue Ball Express""). Thank you for saving me the costs of living in Berkeley  to school by allowing me to commute form home.SHut down SSF, San Bruno, and Millbrae trains now!

534,3,"Feb 3, 2011","I take the Bart from Downtown Berkeley or Rockridge to Daly City and back 3x a week for work, with an occasional 1 or 2 extra trips to Powell for shopping.Pros:Gets you to most of the major cities in the Bay Area, at a speed competitive with driving (especially since driving = sitting in traffic most of the time here), without requiring any worries about tolls or parking.Efficient. The Bart is more reliable than a bus because it will actually show up at the time it's supposed to.Clipper card + 6.35% HVD autoload!Train conductors stick half their body out their window to make sure those automatic doors aren't closing before everyone's in.Cons:Lots of sketchy people on the BART and it sucks to have to sit near them.Questionable cleanliness of the cloth seats and carpeted floor.Expensive, though if traveling to SF, not as expensive as paying the $6 Bay Bridge Toll and THEN trying to find and pay for parking.Sometimes the BART is laggy or makes random stops to let other trains pull ahead/get back on schedule/maintenance.Most BART stations have broken escalators, so expect a lot of running up and down stairs.Crazy crowded anytime people want to go to work / leave work from Powell, Montgomery, and Embarcadero.Once, I saw a drug deal happen right in front of me.80% of the female BART window workers are always angry.Supposedly, a $250 fine for eating/drinking on the BART.Closes at midnight so you can't stay out too late (a la Cinderella).Sometimes some lines just don't run and you have to take another one and transfer.",bart

538,3,"Feb 24, 2011","Well BART where to begin?  Hm... Oh, first, people it's just BART not The BART.  Adding ""the"" makes you seem like a tourist.  *Done being a jerk*Okay so I took BART nearly every single day of my college life.  That means from August of 2006 to December of 2010 I was on the Fremont/Daly City train.  This being said I've got plenty of experiences that create a reason for this review to be middle of the road 3 stars.Most days I didn't have a problem.  I got on in the morning, was at school on time, and then on the way home I got back fine.  Also most days I was on a packed train to and from because I was often on with the commuters so I've never had much of a negative experience regarding BART patrons during those peak times.  However, you bike riders- bikes aren't allowed during peak commute hours so if you're docking stars for people not giving you any room, you may want to think about when you're getting on the train.Though I can't say my time riding BART was without problems.  This is where the system seems to completely fall apart.  If there is a single issue- not matter what size it is- the system comes to a screeching halt.  I guess that's what happens when you've got one track for every line going into the city/east bay cities.  Switch problem?  You're stuck.  Equipment problem?  You're stuck.  In the tunnel from Lake Merritt to West Oakland on any given day?  You're stuck.My biggest issue I've ever had was when there was a fire in the Hayward yard and I was stuck in 100% packed trains from start to end everyday for over a week.  The trains were literally completely full at the first station and cleared out only a few stops before mine which made for some terrible mornings.My other issue was having to get up mega early to get to school on time since it takes at minimum 45 to get from Fremont to Daly City and the Fremont station has very limited parking (I'll do a review for this station later).  Granted this was fine for me because without having to drive I could do homework, sleep, play video games, listen to music, read, and so on.But what of the people.  As I said the commuters are just fine.  Though when I started school late or finished early I was often on trains with rowdy kids, the most ghetto people you can find, and the pan handlers.  I've even had to ride it later at night (7, 8 pm or so) for when I had late classes.  However, Contrary to what you'd think the late trains are actually quite safe.  Most of the people on the train are the people who stay late at the office, people who are exhausted, and people coming/going out.  Though the stations at night are a different story.  While nothing ever happened to me in the stations or on the train, having to get off and transfer at an Oakland station wasn't the best feeling.  So overall it depends on what time you're on the train.  Same goes for station agents.  Some are totally helpful and amazing, some treat you like utter crap.My other problem is that they stop direct service to some places from the city in the evening.  This meant having to transfer trains at 7:30 most nights I had late class so I could get home.  It's not like no one's going that way, but they still end direct service pretty early.The trains themselves are decent.  They are phasing out the carpet in favor of textured floors to increase traction for when it's rainy and so they can be cleaned easier.  The cushioned seats are getting pretty ratty in most trains, but it beats sitting on plastic for an hour.  My biggest complaint is the temperature control in the cars.  Each car has a mind of it's own so some cars will be blazingly hot while others will be freezing- all on the same train.  There are even times where it'll be 80 outside and the heat is on in the car or it's freezing and rainy, but the AC is on.  I just don't get it...Lastly, price.  It is not cheap.  From Fremont/Union City to Daly City is pretty much 12 bucks roundtrip.  There really aren't any discounts for students so I was stuck getting the $48 ticket for $45 at Safeway... woo... I saved 3 bucks... They do offer free transfers for Muni at the Daly City station, but you're better off using SFSU's shuttle.  It is cheaper than gas + bridge + parking + parking tickets, but it's still steep.  Yes they need the money, but you'd think they could do something for students.So that is my mega long review for BART.  It's a necessity for some of us, but it is pricey and you do not want to be stuck when there are problems.",bart

GHETTO FAB! and use caution please. Be aware of your surroundings and valuables.

A distinguished-looking elderly gentleman sitting next to my friend, who has been quietly reading his paper, suddenly turns to him, and in a voice loud enough to be heard  by everyone close by, says: ""Interesting article in the paper today. It's about a short story contest.""My friend says cautiously, ""Is that right?""The man then says, ""Yes, they had to pick from hundreds of entries.

And somehow, the seat next to me must always look extra comfy. Cuz he/she always ends up there. 3. Fights.

The BART needs renovation to weather an earthquake because we all know if the major when hits the BART is hopeless. Renovation is also needed to add comfort for riders. How about accommodating the bike riders with a bike rack on the BART? Better seating? More poles to hold onto? Another negative about BART is it is expensive, very expensive. Their deals for college kids stink and they should consider students, who are broke. Why can't they make a deal like MUNI?Third, the BART seems to me it always breaks down. If I had a nickel for every time I was late due to a malfunction I would be rich enough to drive into the city. Hmmmm (thinking)....not really, but you can catch my drift.Lastly, How about the BART operate longer hours, so people from East Bay have a more affordable way to get home from going out in the city.The BART works, but definitely could work more efficiently.",bart

When the train enters tunnells, the tinted windows allow you check out cute passengers and then you can catch yourself being caught checking them out. Then there's that quick darting of the eyes. You're fooling no one. lolWhat prompted me to finally write a review was the last time I was on BART. It was just before the World Series. The Giants were playing the Phillies. It was the night that the Giants went to the World Series. I'm getting choked up just thinking about that night. Anyway, BART was packed and there was that one passenger who tries to keep the doors open and holds everyone up. Well, a conductor called that passenger out and told him ""don't be selfish. There are other people on the train that need to get somewhere.""When we started to push towards the door to exit, a couple of the other passengers as well as myself said to our friends ""don't be selfish,"" and shared a laugh.

Outside of SFO and downtown SF the station locations kinda suck, the TVM's can be a pain to use, but overall it's not bad.

555,4,"Jan 7, 2006","Having used public transit in the other major subway areas: Paris Metro, London Underground, New York, Boston T, and DC, I have to say BART does a good job. Compared to most of the other systems, BART is efficient, relatively quiet, and (perhaps unique to BART) carpeted, which does cut down on the noise in the cars. On the downside, the station staff vary greatly in motivation and attitude. Downtown Berkeley staff are helpful, Powell St morning staff are, at best, retarded. I'm a cyclist, which means that when I exit, I have to run my ticket through, exit without the bike, re-enter through the gate, and then exit with my bike through the gate (the standard routine if you have a bike). On two occasions, the guy who works at Powell St has chased after me for failure to pay (yes, I did pay, thank you very much). Really, I love being treated like a criminal. A real upside to the BART system, despite the Powell St experience, is free valet bike parking in Downtown Berkeley. Luxury! They have a bikestation that holds 150 bikes near the ticketing area. You give them your bike and get a ticket. At the end of the day, you retrieve the bike from them. That's it. It means I can bike commute and not worry about having to take my train on board (bikes are banned at peak hours). The system is safe and fairly well patrolled -- I've never had a problem in the seven years I've commuted on it. Returning from the city at midnight is no big deal either. I do wish BART ran until 2am. The last train to the East Bay is around 12:30, which means if you want to go to the city to see a late show, you'll need to drive. Would I rather drive than commute on BART? Heck no. BART is a great service. It's not as quiet as the DC system, and the maps aren't as cool as the London Underground, but it's miles better than the Boston T and I'm grateful that it's here.",bart
556,5,"Jul 3, 2007","Three stars for BART?  Obviously NONE of these people take MUNI who provide a low rating.  It will do no good to give extensive justification for my rating other than to say: it runs on time - all the time - with very few exceptions.  MUNI is exactly the opposite.  'Nuf said!Oh yes, one thing: I lived in San Francisco for over 25 years, until about three years ago.  If I lived in the extremities of the BART line, I would probably complain about the fact that BART does not have and cannot easily accommodate express trains - at least currently.  There don't seem to be many complaints about that though.",bart

Otherwise, not so much.I don't understand why BART continues to raise their fare prices, yet they don't really do anything with that extra money other than pay their drivers the highest salary of any transit agency. Sure, whenever I've needed to take BART to work or to an appointment the train arrived on-time and everything was fine, but what about running until, oh I don't know, 2 AM? How about cleaning your train seats more often? How about making BART stations in the East Bay a little more safe? How about not making me rearrange my schedule to get home from work/school because I can't bring my bicycle on your stupid trains during rush hour?As a transit system that can get me from point A to point B, it's not bad. Unless someone kills themselves by throwing themselves onto the tracks or the train catches fire (both of which have happened to me while on BART), you are on-time. I appreciate that. Now how about using the extra money you jack from me and use it to run later, allow me to use bring my bike during rush hour, or not have to step over the homeless just to get to school.

How else can you get from West Oakland to the city in less than 7 minutes for $3.10?  How would i get home from Rockridge after a big night of drinking?  BART is extremely efficient and damn cheap.  The trains are absolutely disgusting when it comes the cleanliness. They definitely need to replace all of the seats with plastic ones, that way they can wipe them down and sanitize them occasionally.

I would way rather ride the BART then the CalTrans any day!I'm also looking forward to BART extending down in to the South Bay area of San Jose. Once that happens we truly will have a BART system that covers the entire San Francisco/San Jose/Oakland Bay Area.I think far too many people dog a system because of things people do or don't do, but as a whole the BART transportation system is awesome.

565,3,"Oct 10, 2012","At the moment BART trains are decked out with stickers boasting 40 Years of Service. It shows. Really, though - this transportation system is showing its age. I wouldn't use BART if there was another option. There isn't another option and they know it so, hey, why should they try harder? As it stands it sure as hell beats driving into the city. Being able to get on and (usually) get a seat, kick back and just zone out for 45 minutes is usually worth the occasional hiccup. Thankfully, BART has finally started to replace some of those old, filthy cloth seats with new, vastly superior vinyl ones. Having seats people aren't afraid to sit on is a great big step in the right direction. The fact that they are only now just starting this process shows what a stranglehold BART has on the Bay Area transit system, though. Let's remove all that disgusting stained carpet while we're at it. How was this not done decades ago? It makes it easier on the BART cleaning crews as much as anything. BART certainly isn't perfect - especially on weekends whenever they're doing maintenance. The delays can really chew into your day. Trains are mostly on time, but there's always problems here and there. I haven't used a public transportation system that doesn't encounter these problems though. When you're dealing with machines things are bound to go wrong. And in the case of rush hour service, frankly I'm amazed it runs as smooth as it does. While it is getting better if you were to reduce a BART train to its essence it is basically a rolling can of germs. But most of the time it is worth riding with the germs so you don't have to pay for parking, or worry about traffic, or how many drinks you have at the game. Hey, it's public transport - if you're expecting perfection you're bound to be disappointed.",bart

569,3,"Oct 30, 2006","BART is ridiculously expensive, with no weekly or monthly passes like most other major transit systems.  The trains don't come as frequently as they should, and don't run late enough.  The seats are reasonably comfortable, but not very sensibly organized for commute time, with people awkwardly sandwiched between seats instead of standing and holding the railing along the edges.  And passengers can be really annoying -- for example, they will line up and scowl at anyone who cuts in from the side of the line, even when the train is 90% empty. On the plus side, you help out the environment a little by not driving, and it does span a pretty wide range of the Bay Area.  Within SF, there is a decent MUNI/bus system to get around, even to places BART won't take you.  And it's convenient to take to the OAK or SFO airports.",bart

But there are some things that just IRK the living hell out of me.- the seats.  if you've been on other public transit you will know that it is NOT normal for seats to have brown stains and smell like pee.  to this, i suggest converting the seats from cloth covered to plastic seats. yeah it'll be somewhat more uncomfortable but at least it'll be cleaner.- the arrangement of the seats.  as is right now, its really inefficient and can only seat a limited number of people.  japanese JR has seats that go in rows, so it fits more people into the train and more ppl can actually sit.  - not letting strange smelling people in the bart. this def needs to be worked on bc whenever there's someone smelling funny sitting in the train everyone else avoids that area for a good 15 feet. more space is lost.the prices, i suppose, are somewhat reasonable.  the transit system in DC, i think, is a LOT better, though. other than that, good timing, and i wish it ran later.",bart
571,3,"Jan 7, 2013","The Setting:  Daily use of BART system while on project out here.  I am not here on weekends so this review is for weekdays only!On the right panel of this screen I see 6 reviews for BART and all of them are either 5 stars or 1 star....I will take a shot in the dark guess and say that the 1-star reviews likely come from non-frequent riders who have very different expectations for a public transportation system.  That being said....The Cost:  4 starsIf you compare the cost to that of cabs or driving and parking, the BART is insanely cheap.  I pay $7 roundtrip to get from Montgomery to 19th st Oakland.  The parking alone would cost me more.  It is $8 from Oakland to SFO, versus over $50 in a cab.The Time:  5 Stars (for daily commute), 3 stars (for Airport)It is MUCH quicker from SF to Oakland via BART.  It is slower than driving/cabbing from SF to Pleasanton.  It is much slower (around an hour versus 30 minutes) versus cabbing/driving to SFO.  That being said, I'd rather avoid the rental car process in this city for many reasons...NOTE: If you are traveling to a specific destination that is only accessible via one of the lines (Richmond vs Freemont vs Dublin vs Bay Points), I would encourage going to the BART website and looking at their schedule.  It is super accurate and punctual, and it's a cruddy feeling to get down there to see your train leaving and having to wait 15 minutes (or more) for the next one.The Crowd:  4 stars (during business rush hour), 1 Star (any other time)During the business rush hours if 730-9am and 5-630pm, the BART crowd is almost primarily working people, almost all keeping to themselves and wearing headphones.  Bike riders that use the BART are fairly respectful and not pushy with their equipment.  As expected, SF's substantial vagrant population takes over the BART system after-hours, using it to sleep.  They constantly pester you even if you are wearing headphones, which after these months using it, I've now had to resort to being curt with them.  I normally wouldn't but they are fairly aggressive salespeople...The Bottom Line:  This is an effective, normally time-and-money-saving method of transportation in this city, but if you have the choice, I would use other means of transit during the later evening hours (after 7 pm).",bart

Other transit systems should take a page from their notification book (Sac lightrail finally is, oh so slowly). AND they run til reasonably late hours (which is rare these days--at least coming from the town I do).3. Stations are nice, trains are clean (relatively speaking--especially considering they're carpeted and haven't changed much since the '80's).4.

Whenever I go to  BART stations for assistance, the problem gets solved professionally and courteously. Whenever there is trouble on the trains with disruptive behavior from passengers, I use the BART watch app and the response is immediate. Officers are concerned and take their duties seriously. I once lost an iPad on a train and reported it.  Within a week, it was found and returned to me via the BART lost and found, and the reps there were exceptional.

The doors even make a cool sound when they close.  It's a world above the slow, prehistoric Boston subways in comfort, reliability, and convenience.Now that it actually IS the 21st century, though, the trains seem to be a bit worn and shabby, in need of new upholstery at least.  BART still stands up well considering it was built in the 1970's.They really badly need to update the ticket machines so there is some way to get a $4 ticket off a $20 bill and get change in bills or at least, $1 coins.

581,3,"Mar 3, 2010","I've been around the world, and I'm surprised that a city as wealthy and famous as San Francisco can have such a uniformly awful metro system. The only saving grace is that it's the only real decent subway system in the entire State, and after several months of living without one, you're like a starving man in the desert going after the twinkie. I'm also shocked at how expensive the tickets can be, especially for a working person who has to commute (I'm talking $200 a month for some commutes, and this isn't even an unlimited ticket); it's cheaper to drive even with the bridge tolls which is sad.It's very backwards when California heavily subsidizes its automotibles by building out of control freeways, then penalizes people who try to take public transpotation. The midnight closing time is also really ridiculous as well as the filthy fabric seats.I will give it three stars because there are some really nice views going from the East Bay into San Francisco. And the BART stations are some of the few places in California where people from all different classes and walks of life actually stand side by side. The people who ride the BART also tend to be thinner and healthier than car drivers.",bart

The trains are generally clean and run until pretty late ( about midnight or so). WE use it to go from Fremont to the City pretty frequently and have almost always had a good experience. They have signs too so you know when the next train is coming. My only two problems with BART are I think it isa little expensive compared to other systems in other cities. Additionally, I don't really like the zone thing, I think it is a bit confusing and would prefer flat rate or day pass like NYC however I guess I can understand because of the space it covers and though I think it is confusing if you ride it the same route every day I guess you get the hang of it. :)",bart

This must be the first subway system in the world that does not ask you where you are trying to go, how many tickets you want to and then tell you how much you owe them. Of course, if I missed a step on their automated machines as I was rushing last night, yeah, go ahead and let me know, that will make me a smarter traveler next time.",bart

You bet!One night, I was trying to buy a ticket and it wouldn't take my last dollar, so I thought I would try to add fare at the Millbrae station. The Millbrae station wouldn't take my dollar either, so I talked to the attendant, who was in a good mood and let me go through without asking for money. Then she pointed out to me that since I walk with a limp, I should get handicap prices. Handicap pricing for BART tickets is half the price! Talk about a handicap-friendly business.And the other thing I love, which is more about the people than about BART, is that I have never had to stand in a crowded train because someone always offers me their seat. I'm not in a wheelchair, and I'm not really inconvenienced by standing, but I am not going to turn down a seat! I think this shows the caliber of people who commute on BART.BART is also safe and friendly and gets cleaned every time it's in Millbrae. In the east bay,",bart

Today, in absence of a car, you take me around the bay area as needed - gparents, Target, SFO, etc, and you do it cheaper than driving would cost. You also let me ride for free in the city with my Muni pass.And this morning, even though your schedule says you don't start service till 8am, you ran trains early for Bay To Breakers.I was wrong about you, and I apologize.",bart

I commend you for preventing me from any unnecessary road rage if I were to drive to Giants, As, Raiders, Warriors games, Oakland airport, and SF airport. Thanks for being there for me when my paranoid self does not want to drive in stop and go traffic! To top it all off, I love you for being so darn close that I can literally roll out of bed and walk across the street 2 minutes before my train comes and rush in on time. =)P.S.

We have the Trolley, which I love, but it seems to move at the speed of sound, where as the BART moves at the speed of light. You don't call the trolley ""rapid"" transit, but it's good enough I suppose.The BART has many advantages though. People use it because it goes to the right areas. It's not expensive. Basically, if you're a commuter in a central business district, the BART is the only way to travel--sometimes with a combination of other mass transit enterprises.I've used the BART on occasion and I have to say, it's not the best mode of transportation in the world, but it definitely beats sitting on the Bay Bridge for an hour in traffic.",bart

A year ago, BART decided to adopt Einstein as its patron saint and proclaimed ""Time is relative"". Since then, its services have been increasingly erratic to the point where its customer ratings shoot through the roof when passengers manage to reach their destination the same day.In such a brave new world of worsening services in so many variables(cleanliness, engine trouble etc) is there an invariant, an absolute which is immune to change? The only such constant lies in the protection of redundant jobs and high paying salaries and perks of unionized BART workers.",bart

Why, oh why, must you use upholstery on seats and carpet in your cars? If we need to give up comfort, I'd sit on cleaner plastic seating than a mystery soiled seat any day.  Visit other cities' public transit-like Portland's or even NYC's to see how much cleaner & more streamlined their trains are.  2.  Spare the Air Day.  What happened to this? Where is that West Coast progressiveness to lead our country to greener pastures & less emissions? 1 day this year versus 4 days last year?  3.  BART tickets.  If they get de-magnetized or whatnot, why are there at least 3 different responses on what you can do from agents?4.  Bonus.  You should reward passengers every now and then with an incentive to ride BART-free cups of coffee, BART rides, etc....

603,2,"Sep 12, 2006","I really want to love BART, still do. I don't really mind the cost so much, but BART is really not extensive enough, so if you want to use it for your commute, chances are you will have to drive somewhere and park at a station (which is not always an available choice). And if you do have a BART Station with parking, the price can be pretty steep. You can expect to pay $84 a month for the privilege to get a parking spot before 10AM. If you live in the city, then you will have to cab or bus to a station, there isn't much available (let alone affordable) parking in the BART stations in the city.  I subtracted a second star because BART cars has these nasty cushions and carpets that are pretty gross -- you can smell the fact  that people sweat, barf, and piss on those things, and I am not sure that it is a great decision on the part of BART to have carpet and cheap cloth seat coverings. Why can't they just make it smooth plastic or metal, something easy to hose down and clean like in other major cities (e.g.: NY, London) where they have public underground transport ? BART gets another star less for its operating hours. For the most part, you have Cinderella syndrome when it come to travelling via BART -- you need to get there by midnight if you do not want to be stuck. The only time they operate long hours are when they shut down the bridge, and that is a real shame -- weekend traffic into the city suffers as a result of the short operating hours, in my opinion.",bart
604,4,"Aug 7, 2008","Having never lived anywhere that any transit protocol other than driving was realistic, I was thrilled when I moved out to California and could take BART places. Nine years later and I'm still a pretty staunch defender. It's downsides are plenty - the lack of a late night schedule, the constant fare hikes, the occasional inexplicable delays, crowded old cars that may not be dirty but certainly aren't clean, to name a few - but once I finally made it to living in the city and working downtown, being able to knock out 85-90% of my travel needs for a $45 monthly pass is pretty great. I mean, I paid nearly $60 for one tank of gas last weekend. Given the reigns for a day I'd probably focus on non-absorbent seating, better air circulation and cooling, and providing people the means to get to or from the East Bay at night - at least 12th St to Embarcadero. I'd post the occasional reminder of good public transit etiquette so that locals aren't constantly groaning at tourists to walk left, stand right! or not stand in the ticket gate until your ticket is in hand, and in a perfect world I'd extend you all the way around the bay (even though I don't think it's your fault you're not) and cheapen your fares. Oh, and either more handles or lower overhead bars so that my girlfriend has something to hold on to please!

The BART was about to go on strike on August 17 and I go back to Los Angeles on the 18th. ""Shit! Fuck me! God damn those stupid economic wreckers!"" All those thoughts (plus other not so nice thoughts) were what went through my mind when I read the front page or the Examiner on a Saturday afternoon on a MUNI train. I began to look for alternative route. Fortunately there's a bus route that does go into the airport or at least close enough. I never rode the bus because the Union leader agreed to a last minute deal which, at the time, have yet to be voted by the workers. I don't know if they agreed or not because I don't give a crap. California need to pass a law to ban public transportation workers from striking! Anyhoo. I was lucky I get to experience the BART again! *giggles*",bart

I once tried applying for the BART Train Operator position, but that spot is harder than diamonds to get into... ANYWAY, I'll reiterate: BART is #1 in America imho!!!They're not that grimy (Cmon, what're you, afraid of a few germs?!? Worst affliction you can catch is possibly HIV, which is decimated soon as the virus hits O2 anyway.), they have free days (dubbed ""Spare the Air Day""), and they're the most convenient move you'll make when crossing the baaaaayyyyy areaaaaaaa!!! Additionally, AC and heating is provided. Now isn't that comfort or what? The plushy seats aren't bad either.Sure, their fares increase every year The Lord's present, but hey, when this snake is the metal beast covering the best climate case in the world, you had better shut your trap about whatever touchy feely problems you associate with it.

It basically goes in a line up Market to the airport and doesn't get you close to half of what you want to get close to. MUNI is good for this, but try getting to the Marina on BART. Not happening. Any other transport system might branch off, and even maybe branch to the south, hitting San Jose and Redwood City, and maybe even connecting via one of the other bridges... A circle would be nice. Convenient. Or help me out and get a shuttle from Alameda. Oh, and speaking of convenient, parking is not. West Oakland seems to be the place with the best chance of parking, but most of the lots are ticketed only or so small you just circle in frustration.

There are far less crazies  than Muni and a 45 dollar fastpass gets  you anywhere in  the city. I've been driving everywhere, though, and  the last time I took BART, I got busted for my free ride.

And also i'm sure i would have gotten ridiculously lost in my own car. (Not that I didn't walking around, but it was easier to figure that out, at least).  Talk about convenient. Sure, it could be cleaner. Yeah, it can get pretty crowded.  But as public transport goes, this was a great idea. My trip to San Francisco wouldn't have been the same without it. Oh yeah.

I'm willing to pay extra for trips that don't go to work or the boyfriend's house, but this isn't even an option. Secondly, why is it so hard to find a ticket machine that takes credit cards?

I think only London is more outrageously expensive, but larger world class cities like Paris were always providing decent unlimited passes at reasonable prices!Why does so much money keep getting poured into widening roads and a subsidizing lots of selfish people who throw a fit when there are carpool lanes? This is something that needs to be subsidized but I guess I can understand why people are leery of that due to the crazy amounts that get spent whenever there's a cool civic project in SF. There are people working 4 jobs and they have families where their partner is working too and they can't afford health insurance for their kids. I don't get why BART costs so much but freeways cost so little. I realize that there's subsidized pubilc transportation though so that is cool!Are the taxes really so high like I always hear people complaining?

Instead they offer us Muni busses with NO AIR CONDITIONING. It's so hot in this bus. You think that Bart would pony up some quality service for its riders given the prices we pay. What are we paying for? An outdated train that is barely comfortable? Major disappointment. This is America 2015.,bart

The seats are padded (and as my European sister-in-law mentioned, pretty wide to accompany fat, American asses).Things I won't miss:a.) People who pretend to sleep on BART so that they won't have to give up their seats for pregnant women or the elderly or disabledb.) The guy who brushed his teeth on BART and spit his wastes into a discarded Chronicle (back when newspapers used to litter the trains before everyone got smart phones)c.)

It's stations are clean and well organized, while the trains are comfortable with plush seating.The routes are priced depending on how far you are going on the system, however it offers a very good cost-effective option!

652,3,"Aug 1, 2013","I'm typing this review, as I am riding the BART into San Francisco. While I haven't used the service in months, I depended on it religiously my freshman year of college to bring home on weekends. Trains usually arrive every 15 minutes on weekdays and every 20 on weekends, which is fine (even though it doesn't quite reach Rio De Janeiro's one-bus-every-10-seconds). They try their best to clean their compartments, but most of the old seats are littered in stains and are breeding grounds for bacteria (Apparently, according to a NYT article, the seats are soiled in ""fecal and skin-borne bacteria."" Yuck.) Fortunately, these are being replaced by new, coated seats that are easier to wipe down. BART will also be replacing all compartments with next-generation ones soon, which I find exciting.Now, the bad: While I've usually been able to work in peace on the train -- it's not the NY subway -- you should expect your fair share of solicitations: Panhandlers making their way through the entire train, compartment by compartment, are not all that uncommon. Sometimes they'll stop in your compartment and start shouting at everyone. BART also closes at midnight every night, which is annoying. I understand that they need to close shop from 12-4 a.m. for maintenance, but couldn't they do this from 2 to 6 a.m. on weekends at least? I know that this is not BART's fault per se, but it's also frustrating that it takes 2 to 3 hours (sometimes more on weekends) by public transit to get from Berkeley to Palo Alto.

Don't use long-term parking at BART. If you do, instead of posting your proof of payment on your car, instead post a sign that says, ""My car will be parked here for several days and nobody's really looking. Would you like to steal it?""2.)

I'd normally love to give this business a 5, but cannot justify it based on the following:* restrooms need improvement in cleanliness* certain BART stations are not in very safe locations (e.g. West Oakland)* excursion fare is rather pricey (more than $4.00) - I think I understand that this allows a person to ""tour the system"" within 3 hours for a fairly cheap price, but what about the person who forgets something and needs to exit the same station within seconds/minutes of entering? Maybe there should be a timestamp, in that the excursion fare only applies after, say, 20 min but not before. I don't think it costs too much money/energy to process a single entry/exit, so it may be okay to not charge excursion for people needing to immediately exit.

The BART ticket machines are not very user friendly. Once you get the hang of them they are not so bad but still. In LA the ticket machines are far easier to use even when you are using them for the first time. Part of the reason it is difficult to use the BART machine is due to the fact you need to see how much it costs to get to your destination. After this you fiddle with buttons to tell the machine how much you have to pay. If you are a first timer you will take a great deal of time figuring out how to do this and it probably annoys the locals haha! I've seen bewildered people ask how to use these machines. I've seen bums help passengers out when they spot their bewildered faces.In LA you can get a day pass, a week pass or a monthly pass for most of Greater LA at the machines. I do not think you can get that from the BART machine. I'm pretty sure you can't. You need to get tickets or passes for the SF MUNI system elsewhere. As far as I know, you can get a pass for both BART and the MUNI but this is definitely not at the machines.I have heard people brag about how efficient BART is here in LA. I always believed them since I know how long you need to wait for buses in LA and since I know that some of the train runs are few and far between. When you think about it though LA is massive and the Frisco peninsula is narrow. Kind of hard to be inefficient there. Considering how massive LA is I actually have more respect for our public transportation system. i do have to give BART credit for their cushy seats though haha! They are far more comfy than the seats in LA!The worst thing about BART is that it is NOISY as heck during some parts of your journey. In any case, BART is good enough for me. However, it is a lesson in appreciating LA more. No, BART isn't better and the NYC subway isn't better either.

You have no idea the public transport envy I feel when I come to the Bay Area or London and see that.  It screams efficient.Hence, I love the BART.  It is expensive, as other reviewers have pointed out, but it is a sweet ride.",bart
683,4,"Jul 22, 2010","Dear BART, you talked to me today and had me all freaked out for a total of 2 minutes!  It's nifty that you've implemented an automated teller to repeat how much dinero one puts in the ticket machine, but it's also a bit scary.  I don't really understand the purpose, but this is me assuming that all deaf/mute/blind people don't benefit.  Anyhoo, although your trains don't come too often and you have YET to go to San Jose, you are the bomb for transporting my carless self from Berkeley to Fremont most weekends during college, and now from SF to Oakland/Fremont whenever I randomly need to go visit friends and family.  I don't really understand why you are ravaging Lake Elizabeth in order to make the extension to Warm Springs, but if you promise to have her back to her normal self by the time you're done with whatever it is you're doing, I'll forgive you for the inconvenience of having to walk around detours in my favorite place.  Thank you for all the good times, interesting characters and entertainment too.  If only you had cops that didn't shoot innocent people under the mistaken premise of grabbing tasers, I'd really really like you and maybe give you 4.5 stars.  Be careful about who you keep in your company because you eventually become them.  Peace.",bart
684,1,"Oct 28, 2008","The only reason I ever rode Bart is because it got me from point A to point B.  Period. Well, I take that back.  The second reason is because the cost of driving downtown would cost me 2 craps and a whistle to park my ride.  Thank god I don't work in the FiDi anymore!Onward....The Good - Like I said, it got me from A to B.  The Bad - The trains smell like ass and they look just as bad.  It's in need of a serious overhaul and for the amount of $ that they pull in, they should be able to afford it.  Not only that, but any old stank-ass vagrants can ride it and you don't know if the person that was sitting in your seat before you is one of them!  Nasty stuff.  You have no idea WHAT was in that seat or what germs and nasty sh*t was left behind, unknown to the naked eye.  The Ugly - They should change the name to FART.

They're hella jealous!Employee 2: Me too, man!  I make more a week than my brother makes a month!

I sometimes worry about riding it after viewing several You tube videos of weirdos jacking off next to other passengers and others starting fights and harassing passengers. It's dirty and too many riders have zero respect for keeping it clean for all of us to enjoy. And the security and workers hardly ever enforce the rules or go after those who litter or the mental nut bags, instead they like to shoot youngsters and take the law into their own hands. Bart, I know I sometimes have to rely on you to get me into the city and to work, school, interviews etc..and although you're a bit cheaper than taking the Bay link Ferry, I think I'd rather pay more to feel more secure and know I'll be getting to my destination on time and in one piece.

I'd guess it takes about the same amount of time (30"") as taking an expensive cab, and definitely less time than renting your own car (not to mention the annoyance, expense and time to park once you get there).Your BART card doesn't expire, so hold on to it, grab a machine the next time you're at a station, and just add more money to it if need be.

I was only coming back to lower my rating...So, I have been riding BART for the last year just about everyday of the work week.  And until May it has been great.  I enjoyed getting on the train and heading out to my gig in Emeryville every morning.  Nice to have a 26 minute warm-up for work every morning, listening to the iPod, reading and trying to keep my bike out of everyones way.  I laughed as I saw gas prices rising, knowing that I drive now about 150 miles a month!  Ha! Gas means nothing to me sucka!No. TLR, Not so fast.....Yesterday marked the 4th major delay on BART in the last 30 days.  This time I was 50 minutes late.  Now, I leave a cushion... but holy crap!  That is just about an hour stuck in a tube?!  With little knowledge of when I would be let free.  We just had a rate increase too. What give BART?

697,3,"Sep 6, 2006","It's so great that we have a functional subway here in the bay area. I live 2 blocks away from North Berkeley Bart and use it all the time. Having said that there are some serious problems I find. 1) Expense: Why oh why do I have to pay $10 for a round trip to the city? Between gas & toll carpooling quickly makes more sense which makes Al Gore sad. 2) Downtown SF only!?!?!? Oh I dearly wish there was a line out to the Richmond. Someone told me that there is some earthquake safety problem but of that I'm not sure.  3) Wacky Bartcard: Almost all other public transportation systems in the world use a flat rate. A $1.50 to get into the system and free to get out. This can be quite a hassle if you have to get a bunch of people into the train since each of them needs their own damn card. When they are tourists in turns into a fiasco .... ok so you say that the further you go the more you should pay? Why, then, is the minimum charge $1.40? If I only travel one stop it should be proportionate as well ... where is my $.50 bart stop? 4) Bus transfers : Ok so this is arguably a fault of the bus systems but i'm going to complain here anyway. You leave a bart station, grab a handy bus transfer and viola you can get to the Richmond (after 45 minutes of battling traffic and 10 zillion stops). Then it's time to come back ... if you don't make sure to bring exact change with you watch out ... you are going to get some nasty stares. I really wish that all bay area public transportation systems used the same magnetic cards. Then transfers could be calculated automatically. 5) San Mateo and Santa Clara county voters : IDIOTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 6) Train notification signs : when they aren't blank or telling you about some stupid safety precaution or advertising they occasionally tell you when the next train is coming and how big it is. Why they can't simply have that up there and post permanent signs for the other BS is well beyond me.",bart

707,3,"Aug 14, 2008","BART is the easiest and best mass transit system to use to get all around the different parts of the Bay Area with perhaps Amtrak coming in a distant second.  I used BART for several years for my daily commute from the East Bay (San Leandro) to the Financial District (Montgomery St), which only took 30 minutes door-to-door (assuming there were no delays). And only costs $11 roundtrip (includes $1/day parking for Fremont station)Yes, I'm aware the system has its occasional hiccups and outages, but no system is perfect.  During my rides on BART, I can simply take a power-nap to refresh myself before I reach my destination (whether it's my office, car, or the Oakland Arena to watch a Warriors game - Yes, I'm aware that Baron Davis is now w/ the Clippers, but I was a loyal Warriors fan before he came to the Bay Area...they're still our local b-ball team...even if they do suck), read a book, do some work, or just catch up on my Wallstreet Journal or e-mails.  Today, I still can rely on BART to hope on the Fremont station, quickly coast down to downtown SF to do my holiday shopping without having to worry and fight against traffic or other people for parking.  The price of the tickets have increased and we now have to pay for parking, but I guess that's what's needed to keep this system going and improving.If/when they finally get rid of all the red tape and bureaucracy and extend BART down to San Jose and the rest of the South Bay, and effectively connect all three airports (SFO, Oakland, & San Jose Int'l), then I'll uprade my rating of the system to 5-stars.",bart

Bart seems to keep me posted pretty well. There are times where Bart can let me down, and that's the precise reason I didn't give it five stars. There are always improvements that can be made, but I'm satisfied thus far. Another thing to note about Bart is the convenience factor. I don't know how many times I've gone down into the station, and lone behold my Bart train is already there! I can clock getting downtown to about ten minuets or less... school about 20 minuets...now how awesome is that?  No matter how you look at it Bart is one of the better forms of mass transit around. Now I just wish boyfriends were as punctual as Bart..eh I won't hold my breath...",bart

I went to grad school in Boston, and holy shit, the Boston T is like an insult to humanity.  Here are BART's strengths and weaknesses in comparison to other major US transit systems (e.g., New York, Boston, etc):Pros:Fast (BART's *lowest* typical speed - 36 mph - is nearly as fast as the *fastest* speed of an NYC express train) +++Reliable (my experience is about 98% on time) +++Safe (0 fatal accidents in approximately 20 billion passenger miles) ++Cheap (people complain that it's more expensive than Boston, but per mile it's a lot cheaper) +Comfortable (rarely reaches true crush loads) +Clean Stations +Timed Transfers...OMG, these are the best things ever +Cons:Worse Coverage Area (but that's not really BART's fault - it's the geography of the area) --Infrequent Off-Peak Service -Trains Carpets Getting Funky -BART wins 12-4...that's enough for 5 stars in my book.Update - my favorite BART quote ever:""BART, which carries about 340,000 riders a day, meets schedule about 95 percent of the time.

716,3,"Nov 13, 2007","Traveling from the South Bay to the City...Commuting from San Jose to San Francisco five days a week is not for everyone.  It requires mad skill.  Different modes of transportation should be used on different days, depending on what you have going on in any given situation.  Picking one's mode of transportation from the South Bay to San Francisco is much like choosing which wine to have with your food.   It takes finesse.  Experience.  Taste.  Ones choices are:  1) Fremont BART; 2) Caltrain; or 3) Driving.If one chooses the mode of transportation wisely, one can make it from San Jose to the financial district in San Francisco in an effortless hour to hour and a half.  Effortless, because your time will be spent catching up on a favorite novel, reading the newspaper, or calling a friend you haven't spoken to in ages.if you do not choose wisely, you will be stranded in a quagmire of public transportation or gridlock hell.  There will be no parking spot at BART or Caltrain.  BART or Caltrain will be delayed.  You will miss the express service and it will take 2 hours to creep into the City.  And then, once you get to the City, MUNI will not show up.  Or, you will spend two hours in your car inching up the 101.So when should you take Fremont BART to the City?  In one, and only one situation.  When you are both leaving the South Bay and the City either extremely early or extremely late.  Mix and match as you please -- it will give you 4 combos (early-early; early-late; late-early; late-late).  But you can never, ever, plan on leaving either the South Bay or the City at a normal time.  This is very similar to the rule that you should not feed gremlins after midnight. You may take BART if you need to get into the City very early (leaving Fremont no later than 7am).  Why?  If you don't leave Fremont obscenely early, you will not find a parking spot at BART.  Or, leave Fremont late, by 10am -- more parking spots open at that time.  Conversely, leave the City early -- no later than 2pm.  If you leave between 3-7, you will be stranded on the parking lot, aka the 880 South.  Thus, BART is also a fine choice if you are having a late dinner in the City, and want to leave from 7 - 9 pm.BART gets three stars, because it is generally reliable.

Back to the delays, medical emergencies cannot be helped for the most part,  but the reason for the holding of the train is what exactly?   Track maintenance during the commute hours??  The results of delays are not just the obvious issues with attendance wherever one is traveling, but also crowded trains.  When a train is delayed, more people get on at each proceeding stop.   Lack of personal space aside, tensions as well as temperatures rise.  It makes for a very stressful and potentially unsafe(?) start and or end to one's day.  Now I don't know if BART ever promised a pleasant ride, but somehow I would think that some basic safety questions would at least arise but hopefully be addressed.  How many people is safe to travel in each car?  Is it safe to hold trains at the end of Warriors games, or the last train of the night and send BART reps to the platforms to pack people like sardines (and I mean to the point of not being able to move any part of one's body) and send them on their way??  Is trained staff on board to address medical issues that arise from this stuff?  Yes the solutions to my concerns have a hefty price tag, but the price of not addressing them might just be greater.  I'm not just talking about personal comfort and individual passenger health, which sadly hasnt been enough to motivate a change, I'm talking about larger scale effects on the economy.  Where could we be if more people could just have a reliable and safe commute to work not to mention the rest of this beautiful Bay Area?  Ok, off the soapbox.  What are your thoughts?BART, my request to you,  since you increased our fares at least once since I became a rider promising improvements, please deliver.   It's great that threw are new cars and seat covers,  but what I care about is reliability.   Thank you.   Day one:  2/6/15 : took the Daly City train that should arrive at embarcadero at 8:44.  I am currently leaving as I type, West Oakland station and it is 8:50.    We arrived at embarcadero  at 8:57.  Now, on the ride home, we are holding as we are backed up behind a ""couple of trains""... at 5 :51",bart

In fact I took BART to the Golden State Warriors game the other night  with my homeskillet and I was amazed at how quickly I got there!

I can leave my car in Pleasanton and catch the train into the city for a week of being car-free.  I can go to Berkeley and catch the train to Oakland or to SF.  When I'm in the south bay I can park at Millbrae and go anywhere from there.  That's where the Cal Train station connects to BART too.

Yes many people use you for commuting and trips into the city for entertainment like concerts and dining, but miss the last train before midnight and you are screwed. It's so annoying getting out of the Warfield and making sure you get to BART before the last train. Or if you leave Oakland Coliseum and you need to transfer, do it early enough or you'll miss it! ugh! What's the point? You just might as well turn into a pumpkin.....The NYC subway isn't the cleanest and yeah it's pretty crowded at commute times but it's so easy to get around the city. And it's CHEAP!

It would be nice if it was flat rate like NYC, Chicago, and LA subway and train systems, but you can't have everything.

They should do more to integrate the different transit systems around the Bay Area so you can just use the same card (E.g. in NYC, the same farecard lets you on either the subway or the bus.).- The BART tickets are so easily demagnetized!

I don't even have to go outside!It cracks me up that the little schedule at the Millbrae Station has ""Union Square"" penciled in next to Powell Street, I guess a lot of people had questions on how to get to Union Square.Also, huge plus that BART can take me to Little Star in the Mission and eliminate the headache of parking.

738,3,"Apr 20, 2011","I've ridden public transit in Washington, DC, Boston, NYC, Philly, Houston, Amsterdam, Paris, Barcelona, and London.  How does the BART measure up?  Decently.  There will probably not be a service representative to answer any questions.  If there are, they will be deep in conversation and ignore you until you interrupt them.    There are kiosks with which you can use cash or credit/debit to purchase tickets.  You have to figure out your destination to figure out how much cash to put on the ticket.  There is no way to input how much to put on your card, just start with where the machine allows you and then you have to use the up/down arrows to add/subtract dollars and cents to your ticket.  Annoying.  You will have to swipe in at your entry point and exit point.  The platforms have electronic signs that do tell you when the next train is arriving, pretty accurately.  It's expensive compared to all of the other cities in which I've ridden public transportation.  In Boston, I can get from the airport to anywhere on the MBTA $2 ($1.75 with a Charlie Card).

It's totally worth it if you live in SF because $45 for a monthly MUNI fast pass will let you take BART unlimited within the city.The price can add up if you commute from the East Bay but I think BART is an excellent public transportation system! The gripes I have about the trains (esp the ones with carpet) is that it can get smelly/damp on rainy days and the seats can have questionable stains.

If you work off-hours like I do, it's a different story. Riding during the day isn't too bad, except for the panhandlers (sometimes aggressive) walking the trains and the general semi-foul smell that BART always seems to have. If you're riding at night, however, you best be on your guard. In the past two weeks of riding (I come home from working weeknights close to midnight) I've seen: 1) a loud argument between two homeless people in the 12th street station result in one of them violently kicking the train 2) a fight on a train over a hat 3) a guy stripping naked in the Montgomery station 4) someone smoking crack on the train. This was pretty much the last straw for me, so I usually commute via car or the bus now. Basically, if you plan to ride after 9 PM, prepare for some crazy stuff to go down.

The system closes at midnight for some reason, which doesn't make sense on the weekends. If you want people to stop driving while they're intoxicated, have the public transportation system (BART especially) open longer to accomodate the crowds during late-night weekends.

765,3,"Nov 1, 2008","A few things BART could do to be kick-ass:- Install that glass barrier thing like they have for the SFO AirTrain.  I was on the train when some dude leapt onto the tracks at Civic Center and held up the entire system for hours.  Thank god for Muni, but, having some sort of barrier between the passengers would keep bodies off the track, keep other sorts of debris off the track, and stop that wind tunnel effect when trains come roaring into the station (esp. at 24th and Mission)- Run earlier and have more frequent trains on the weekends.  Maybe it's just me and my early-bird ass, but it sucks having to wait until like 8:30 on a Sunday to catch the train down to Daly City.  At times I just took the J to Balboa Park and hopped on the 54 Felton bus to the Daly City Station instead of waiting for the station to open.  And I wasn't commuting to a weekend job either, but I know a lot of people do.  Having the option to take the train instead of the bus would be nice.- RUN LATER.  Remember when the trains ran all night that one time?  That was awesome.  Not only would I have to peace out of parties too early to make the last train, but it might help its budget problems if, you know, more people were riding the train.  I know I'm not the first person to suggest this, but they really need to consider it.  C'mon!All in all, it's doing a great job, but it could be excellent if it did these few things.",bart

770,5,"Sep 24, 2015","For all its quirks, BART is a major asset to the SF Bay Area and a strong positive quality of life differentiator. I take it from the far suburbs to the City pretty much every day and to me that beats driving in our traffic jams in every way.  Of course, it helps that I live at the end of the line and can always get a good seat on my way to work so I can sleep or do something fun or productive.It is mostly functional as big delays are fairly rare (once or twice a month do I get hit by those). If one wants to live near a station, the choice of neighborhoods is great as the service area in the East Bay is large. The stations and trains are clean-ish and modern-ish (compared to Chicago or NYC). Clipper payment system is impeccable. Many stations do have large parking lots that always have room if you are there by 7:30. A lot of the tracks are elevated or at least are on the surface, affording a great view of the Bay Area. Most importantly, speed is unbeatable when roadways are congested.It is unfair to compare BART to transit in places like Northern Europe or East Asia. Sure, those are superior but for America, BART is just awesome. It is no secret that public transportation is just not a priority in this country so an apples to apples comparison is called for. In my experience, the only system in the US that compares to BART in both service area and cleanliness/modernity is the Washington Metro and even that comparison is a toss up. Folks like to bring up NYC as the ultimate transit success yet as functional as its subway is, a lot of it is unbelievably delapidated.I love my BART.",bart

I'm no PhD in sociology or behavior science so I know what people want/need/act.  Bart is really hit or miss.  1)  When I was a kid... I would drive over to west embarcadero and bart into work at embarcadero center.  Great... took me within a block of where I needed to be, saved me $$ on parking and bridge fare.2)  Going to an A's game?  awesome.. there is stop right there.3)  I went up to a class in downtown oakland.. I parked at the Fremont  station and took BART all the up and back.But that's kinda it... I still have to drive on one side to get to a station.... and most of the time, one of the stations, either the head or tail end, are in areas that are kinda sketchy, and I don't REALLY wanna spend time there, and there aren't any convenient/safe connectors on the other side.BART isn't especially cost effective...  doesn't run frequently enough for me to say ""wow... that was convenient,""  as an overall trip, because I have to drive to one end, isn't especially fast.... it's a chore and an effort to use mass transit like this.It fits the uses of some people... while not others... bummer!!  why is it that in the bay area... we have like 40 different bus lines, and half a dozen rail lines for public transit!!!  is it because our public works and government is just all suck arse that they can't get people to decide on stuff?  sheesh...  no wonder everyone is buying a hybrid!!!",bart
777,2,"Jul 11, 2008","Good points:- You'll get there. Eventually.- Better than nothing. Usually.- Only delayed sometimes.- The newer refurbished cars are much more pleasant to ride in. (although they still have to do something about those nasty old seats)- Gets you to the airports. (tho' AirBART is still a freaking joke)- Newer stations are fairly nice and more-or-less modern.- Recently, they actually seem to have gotten half a clue about making real-time train arrival and system status information available via the web and mobile devices.Bad points:- Trains and various station technology stuck in 1983 (I'm surprised they don't still have ticket machines that use Nixie tubes for their displays)- Train cars are filthy more often than not. Newspapers strewn hither and yon, half-full soda cans rolling around, chicken bones tossed on the floor, sunflower seed shells everywhere.- Air conditioning never works. (or am I mistaken about the trains even HAVING air conditioning?)- Mumbling train operator announcements... ""NESTOPIZZMSHSHSDHFPIUTHHSUTD, CHNGREFREDASFARPRTGHDDGGGFHD ANNASFDGSHGHGFUEDF""- Expensive (and rising) relative to other transit systems in the US and abroad, while reliability and rider experience is generally much poorer and, aside from minor improvements like the refurbished car interiors, seems to be declining.- Many stations are in very poor repair. Ugly 1970s earthtone color schemes only seem to accentuate the 35 years of grime oozing all over everything. Restrooms, if they're in service, are reminiscent of the 3rd world.- Useless after midnight.- Appears to be managed by cranio-anally impacted morons.- Rider information, maps, announcements, not always clear, sometimes needlessly misleading or confusing. Only took them 35 years to finally acknowledge in their printed materials the presence of, and ability to transfer to, other transit systems such as MUNI, Caltrain, Amtrak, etc. - Continually commits clueless and inept media and public relations gaffes, only furthering the the impression that the system is run by overpaid and out-of-touch boobs.- Infighting and lack of cooperation with other transit agencies appears to have contributed further to the already overdue and overbudget TransLink card rollout.- Tickets that get demagnetized if you look at them the wrong way, causing riders delays exiting the station, and frustration trying to get replacements issued. (Oddly, I've never had a BART ticket get screwed up on me outside of the system, it only happens to me after I've ridden a train and then try to exit. It's not like the contents of my pockets are any different in one place or the other. How do I know it's not the new RFID readers for the EZRider cards in the turnstiles jacking the things up?)- The fact that it's the only viable option some people have for getting certain places in anything under half a day.- Probably other snide comments I haven't thought of yet...",bart

Trains depart every 15 min or so and the cost of a one way trip is $5.35.  I took the train to the Powell St station, which incredibly just happened to be located within 3 blocks of my hotel!  The BART is also a great way to get to the Oakland airport or Berkeley.  Just beware, depending on where you're going, you might have to take the muni or a bus as a connection, so in that sense the coverage is a bit limited.  All in all, the trains are clean and comfortable, a super nice ride no doubt!",bart

BART is necessary in my life-I need it to get to work and to take me to Cal Football games...so in the fall I am pretty much on it six days a week, twice a day.  However, just because I frequent BART does not mean I don't notice it's faults.  It's smelly.  Sometimes really, really smelly.  The seats are seriously FILTHY.  The paper tickets get demagnetized really easily (I am looking forward to the BART EZ Rider ticket I just ordered).  It is incredibly loud going from SF to Oakland.  Like, ipod on full blast and I still can't tell what I'm listening to!  Can't they do something about that??  It gets so painfully crowded at rush hour, they can't add a few more trains?  I could go on.  Pretty much, I only take BART out of necessity and the fact that I would feel guilty driving to work everyday.

And, becoming less susceptible to colds.Things that DO suck:As of late, rush hours have been hard - I'm sure from gas prices/economy woes.  There's always a funky smell so maybe one day they will remove those seat covers.

784,3,"Feb 2, 2009","So... it's better than having no public transportation around the bay area and it is definitely better than the muni...but that's not really saying much. Whoever thought it was a good idea to use fabric seats? Everytime I sit down, I think about the possible other people who have sat there after doing whatever it is that they do and i think that it's seeping into my clothes and skin....disgusting ... and unlike stainless steel or other kinds of metal, fabric can actually hold moisture and harbor bacteria... has the public health department been notified? i think it'd be interesting to see how much bacteria, fungi, and other stuff they can find on the bart seats. Why aren't the stations cleaner? Bathrooms?It's not like it already doesn't cost a ton of money for all of the bay area to ride bart. You'd think they'd have a little bit of surplus to do some remodeling or AT LEAST cleaning of the stations and bathrooms. Other things BART should do:-make changes to make it less noisy-make some sort of card/device to which you can add money OR a one time fee for monthly use. -run later (although multiple drunk people put together on a train doesn't seem to be the best idea at time, in addition to the fabric seats, which would probably now also contain vomit)-more security-workers with less attitudeother than that, bart is ok...but then again, that is almost like changing everything but the logo.",bart
785,4,"May 9, 2009","BART is one of the better public transportation system in the Bay Area. It's fast, usually very prompt, and very predictable (they have a ""rotation"" system in place where if a Richmond train is here, you know what train is next). I usually take BART to and from downtown. Too bad it's not more extensive in the city, or else I would take it more often. The stations and trains are relatively clean, and the seats are mostly comfortable. But because the seats are clothed and cushioned, it does (and could) seem somewhat dirty.

We thought this niceness was a fluke until the guy on the other end (we needed to talk to him to use our new hand written ticket) on the way back out of the city was super friendly also.

Traveling opposite to the rush commute, the trains are already 15 to 20 minutes apart!  BART is not cheap either!

793,3,"Oct 9, 2006","Things that suck about BART:They're very careful to make it impossible to see the signs saying when the next train will arrive until AFTER you've swiped your ticket.  Meaning, you're on the hook for $3+ if you decide you could get there faster via some other means.You can't take a bunch of old tickets, stick them in a ticket dispenser machine, and have it spit out a ticket for the combined amount.  Nor can you use old tickets to add value to a new one.  No, to get value out of old tickets, you have to visit BART's service counter at select locations (e.g., Powell St. station) at hours of their convenience.It's loud.  So loud that you can't even listen to an iPod on the thing, without cranking it up to damaging levels.  BART's howl is anything but relaxing.On the plus side, it finally goes to both airports!",bart
794,3,"Jul 26, 2007","I use BART once in awhile, to go to San Francisco or the A's games or to SFO airport, which I find really convenient. However, I am not a big fan of BART for several reasons. One is the fact that the trains are so crowded during rush hours or during an event like a ballgame. There are not enough handrails to hold onto, especially if you are short like me.I once rode to SF during December when one of the routes was closed down. The train kept stopping and loading on passengers until I couldn't even raise my arms because we were packed so tightly. Whenever the train started or stopped everybody tried to stay upright, which was not easy if you had nothing to hold onto.I recently traveled to Scotland, where I rode trains and buses for two weeks. Although some of the older city buses were a bit dingy looking, I would say in general their public transportation system is much cleaner and comfortable than BART. They also allow food on the trains, and even sell food and drinks in most of the larger stations. When we returned home from Scotland I noticed how dirty and worn BART looked in comparison with Scottish trains.Another annoying fact about BART is the unavailability of restrooms at most of its stations. When the stations were first built, they had one single restroom for men and women, which was inadequate to serve the quantity of riders on busy routes. Since then the restrooms have been closed (I just checked BART's website and it states that the street level restrooms are open but those underground are closed). In the UK train and bus stations have restrooms with several stalls, all open when we were last there in May 2007. You sometimes have to pay (currently 20 pence) to use them at larger stations such as Glasgow and Edinburgh, but at least they are there when you need them.",bart
795,4,"Sep 3, 2007","I will never understand why people who board the BART trains in the downtown SF area after 5pm on weekdays insist on forming lines to get on the train. First of all, the lines generally block the passageway for people trying to get off the trains which kind of defeats the purpose of having a line in the first place. Second, people like me just step to the side, wait for the people to come off the train and still manage to board the train before the people who insisted on forming a line get on. Organized chaos perhaps?In New York, there are no lines when it comes to the subway system. Either you push your way to make the train or you get stuck having to wait for the next one. Granted this isn't New York and I haven't had to experience any ""pushy"" BART riders, but people come on. Forming a single-file line is so grade school. Thank god for my monthly MUNI fast pass that allows me to afford to ride BART at all in the San Francisco area. BART is a bit pricey.Recommendation: Feel the seat first before sitting on it. Nothing says a shitty day then sitting on a damp BART seat. Especially if it is the first thing in the morning, on your way to work",bart

I am a union worker as well, and work very hard for my employer. Without my employer I have no job. So why would I milk it dry?

It still is an excellent, smooth-running operation although I will now offer a few friendly suggestions to make it better. But I am REALISTIC also and know that BART is a public agency and what with the economic tumult at hand-my words of wisdom will probably fall on deaf ears. So be it!Coming into SFO and dragging a laptop, backpack and suitcase full of clothing, I am heartened to see that there is now an airport BART stop and make a run for it with all my stuff. But first you have to get on an Air Bus-just like at Disneyland-that takes you to the actual BART stop. Once there-it's time to buy a ticket in the BART machine. Get in line. Hope you have the ride amount of money and change cause I didn't see any change machines. Finally-with ticket in hand, I knew I had to go to Daly City, but trains would come and they wouldn't be announced-just roll in and you would have to ask someone or try to see the front where the place they go is posted. Get to where I am going and fading in the heat fast! Know I have to transfer to a Muni bus & ask the BART attendant at the station about transfers or where to get change. I must have interrupted her important phone call and this devoted public servantsnarled a reply to me that I can go buy a hot dog if I need change? I apologized and thanked her for the information.Bought a hot dog as directed by the personable BART employee who looked like BART just hired her off the crack addict welfare rolls over in Oakland. As soon as I drag myself over to the bus stop-the bus pulls away  from me just as I arrive and I am left to rest on the bench amid the flying in the wind trash and San Francisco vagrants. But finally I have a cool place to sit and ponder BART! The trains are amazing technical creatures run with the efficiency to rival the trains in Switzerland and Germany-like clock-work! IT IS IN THE FALLIABLE HUM AN  ENDEAVOR that BART falls short. Not enough sensible ticket machines. Not enough change machines. No attendants to stand watch and answer questions. No human beings sitting in the little offices there that are CARING & WANT TO HELP! Everything seems to be a hassle & am imposition to them.

Hope you soon create an electronic version of the senior ticket (since I turn 65 next year).One question, if you don't mind...Why is it that your elevators are so often out of service? I have never seen this anywhere else. For example, the busiest skyscrapers whose elevators are in constant use, don't seem to have the problems you do. What's up with that?

Several escalators were not working at Powell Street Station making it difficult to carry our one heavy roller bag to the train platform.  We dealt with two idiots that boarded somewhere in Oakland who ran into the car pointing their fingers at riders making shooting sounds. Then they had to sit in my car of all cars and talk ghetto crap to one another while listening to loud gangster rap littered with ""F"" bombs.

I'd much rather take the SamTrans MX into the City because there are less people, they're usually the same people and the germ quotient is reduced by a huge factor.The aroma factor is also much better on the MX.  BART train aroma is not so good.  Mostly smells like pee and sweat, especially if you sit on either end of each car.  Then there's the sick people...hacking, coughing, sneezing, wheezing.

My friends from L.A. and other places wish they had an alternative to driving (a real alternative, not buses that get stuck in the same traffic.)But it's hard to give them more than 3 stars when you have trains that only run every 15-20 minutes, puke-covered seats and carpets, and endless incidents because it's such a dumping ground for unmedicated crazy homeless people. And a lot of this crap wouldn't happen if BART really served the public instead of existing mainly to funnel over-inflated salaries to its executives' pockets.Some day, there will be an intervention.",bart

817,2,"Oct 29, 2014","Bart is very convenient, overpriced compared to other cities with better public transportation, and VERY NOISY especially in the tunnels. The worst part, though is how filthy some of the stations are. The Powell Street station, for example, absolutely reeks with urine smells, and looks like it hasn't seen a mop in years. I understand that there is some construction going on, but that is no excuse for the complete lack of maintenance. Clean it up, BART!",bart
818,1,"May 7, 2015","If you want to know how messed up BART's priority is, then read this.There has never been enough parking spots in the Dublin/Pleasanton station.  If you don't get there by 7:15am, then you're sunk.  Parking fee went up drastically from $1 to $3 and it didn't help.  Long wait time to get into the monthly restricted parking.For quite sometime, folks can park at nearby station, West Dublin/Pleasanton and use the Stoneridge mall parking lot and Toys 'R Us parking lot as unofficial overflow parking.  We all know that's not legit but what are the alternatives?  I wish they smarten up and let us pay for parking there.  After all, Stoneridge mall has plenty of parking near the station.If BART is a customer oriented organization, that's what they'd do.  A lot of people don't have a choice.  BART is the only public transport to get to the city and they have to drive to go to BART.  Instead of helping them, BART decided to work with Stoneridge mall to close off the parking spots nearby West Dublin/Pleasanton stations.  Those spots just sit there, empty, while commuters are reeling from finding parking, knowing they're running later and later for their work.BART can't be fixed without outside intervention.  The contempt towards its riders is palpable.   I'm actively looking for ways to cut my dependency on BART.  I suggest y'all do the same.",bart

I love the scenery out the windows going northbound after Daly City, It's really nice.However, You always have those delays right when everybody needs them.

So travelling in BART was a pleasure ..till about a month ago.. now, not so much.The frequency is good, stations are good, The trains are fast and there are lots of stations .. excellent.But the traffic is increasing every day, and it is getting more and more crowded. It is not BART's fault, but it would really help if the number of trains are increased for the morning and evening commute.Lately there have been delays everyday, which may be longer than 10-15 minutes. This is very irritating. Most of the times the driver does not even bother to inform us the reasons for the delay.People have to stand for 40 min and the crowd just gets bigger and more angry.  All this gets really frustrating because the cost of commute is exorbitant.All of us also received an email saying that it is going to increase further, dint we ? The cost will be justified if the expected standards for service are met.BART is an excellent service/initiative, but it is time for them to re-evaluate themselves now and make some serious changes.",bart
825,3,"Nov 26, 2017","BART, is now not cheaper than driving to San Francisco.  I've travelled many times through the years, but, Friday, Nov 25th, 2017 was the scariest, dirtiest, and most expensive.  I can't believe how dirty the Sears are, the backs of the seats, the walls, the windows. You could hardly see outside.  It actually cost us more in money and time than driving. But, the threat of the ad and bodily harm was the last straw. We stopped on the way back from San Francisco at the Bayfair Station, and were waiting for a Dublin train, when 8 Teenagers started harassing the few people waiting.  They were loud, jumping through the seat dividers next to us, they were looking us over.  We did see Security waiting to unlock the train doors when we got on, but no one later at the Stations.There should have Security at ever Station, and riding & walking through the trains.  We had to add money to our ticket at Lake Merritt, and there was a guy yelling, and screaming and waving his arms around in a rage.  We quickly moved to the other side.Also, what happened to the change machines?  So many people were looking for them!BART is really neglecting the maintenance and safety of riders.Something must be done.We all know they make millions and are building new Stations, but, they still should be forced to maintain the old ones!  Lastly, bathrooms!!!! Why aren't they open? There should be janitors and Security.  They need to be open!!!I don't know what hell people do when trains are delayed?!!",bart
826,3,"Aug 20, 2005","Ok Good and Bad are equal on BART.Good: It IS clean, efficient, and plain handy when needed. If i need to get to berkley, it can get me there in less than 30 minutes from downtown san francisco. Nothing else can really do that. It also is great for getting to the airport, it is still cheaper than taking an airport shuttle. I can take a cab to the bart station and the bart to the airport and it's still cheaper.Bad: Expensive, moreso than other cities, expecially when you go further than like 5 stops. Also it doesn't really go many important places, usually i have to go to a stop and get a car ride from a friend from that stop to where i am going. I live by fishermans warf, and i get off the BART and have to pay again to get on the MUNI. They should be connected so i don't have to pay more. Also there is no monthly pass for BART. It also is loud and you loose cell phone reception every 2 seconds, which sucks when you have to call the person to pick you up at the stop you are arriving at, but that's not completely their fault, but it's still going into the score above.In all, BART is still the cheapest way to get out of town, the bay bridge costs more than BART most of the time, let alone the cost of buying a car and gas and so on.",bart

Seriously, holding a bike the whole trip is a bitch.2. Cleaner seats and floors.  I did not ride BART to contract Hepatitis, thank you very much.

829,3,"Jul 24, 2008","My blood pressure is certainly lower in writing my BART review than my Muni rant.  Must obtain biorythmn report.  A friendly and observant Peace Officer would certainly be a welcome sight at times - I salute BART Police for even showing up.  Must be god awful duty.  Much like a High School teacher must feel, dealing with seeming grown ups who act like spoiled brat rock stars with the manners of Attila the Hun.The seats are gross.  Cloth?  Come on.  Did I say gross?  Yes.  Gross.  What do they use in the Paris metro or the Tokyo subway?  Use that.  I'd say after having 10 trillion riders a day, perhaps they know what the F they are doing.  But this is America.  Why would we go ask the Dutch fer chrissakes how to build a dyke when the stupid-ass way we manage the Mississippi River and the New Orleans' levee systems seems to be working so freakin' well.  American ingenuity - oh yeah.  Right.  We're The Best.  Rah-rah.  Go Team Go.  One huge plus:  taking it to SFO.  Kudos to all.  This works.  Amazingly simple in concept.  Soooo very difficult in execution.  I mean, how many decades did it take to extend it to the airport?  (I believe about three decades.)  Watching the morons up in Seattle argue about extending their light rail system to Seatac Airport just boggles the mind.  ""A train to the airport?  Who wudda thunk?""  ""But it's not a money maker!"" they scream.  Public transportation is, by definition, not a profit center for a region.  It's like a police or fire department.  Infrastructure folks.  You know, like keeping the roads in working order so we can actually use them.  New concept for some.  Have to give these people extra time on the exam.A nice spit shine to the trains would be cool.  Maybe a new color?  I don't know.  I'm not a designer.  But dirty grey silver stainless is not a good look.    Running them all night only makes sense if you just happen to be in the lower 95th percentile of the population who find that we don't have an extra 50-60$ to pay to get back from our fave haunt in the City to our suburban home.  We don't want drunks on the roads after the bars close?  Then run public transit all night.  Of course, not every five minutes.  Duh.  But how about once every 45 to 60 minutes after 1:00 a.m.?

I do think the shooting incident was an abberation and  I feel relatively safe on BART,  The trains are clean, and the vast majority oof the time on time.   Someties there is elevator issues, but usually I just go to the next station and walk to my final destination.  I don't think I have ever encountered a rude station agent, though at times they could be quicker. (the new wheelchair accessible fare machines have been a godsend in this regard!) I know other places have more stops, but at least in NYC when I went, it was difficulyt to know which stops were and weren't accessible.  I find it more comparable to the Washington DC metro, and tboth of ours have gotten high marks from the disabled community. I do wish it went moore places though.",bart
831,1,"Oct 1, 2010","I used to like Bart the first time using it.  But after using it everyday for the past 3 years the more I hate it.  Now I loathe it. 1. Never on timeThey are never on time and they run purposely slow during the mid morning through to the afternoon.  Even missed a flight once out of SFO because they were 30 min late and didn't bother to explain or warn us.  You can not depend on their schedules at all.  I wonder why they always stop at the same spot in between stations for a few minutes everyday.  I never understood that.  Perhaps they screwed up on their posted scheduling and thats how they make up for it.  But if they had some brains they would just wait at the station so that more people can have the chance to get off or get on the train.  Sitting in the middle of nowhere doesn't help anyone.2. CostThey are way way way too expensive.  To go from Pleasant Hill to SFO is 20 bucks round trip!  (minus 40 cents)  And to go one stop from SFO to the next station is 6.50!  Why?  So that the airport doesn't loose much money from the loss of airport parking?  It should be 2 or 2.50 anywhere jut like the subway in NY.  If one wants expensive traveling then take CalTrain.3. They don't go everywhereUnless you live next to a station and/or your destination is in walking distance of a station, its really not useful or economical. It's actually cheaper for me to drive than to take Bart, that doesn't make Bart very green. I can never get folks to want to take Bart, its way to inconvenient and if you have 2 or more people its not affordable, like if you want to take it to the city, expect to drop 24-48 dollars for a small group of people. That is crazy!Only reason I take it is that my company pays for some of my ticket and I can walk to it from work and home.  I'd rather drive to tell ya the truth, though I hate to pollute unnecessarily, but remember that electricity isn't necessarily harmless to the environment either.At least the stations out in the walnut creek area are clean.  :)  I guess paying union fees up the yin yang does do something for them.",bart

833,2,"Feb 9, 2017",Better than driving on packed freeways but late a lot. The information on delays they give out online and over the speakers inside BART is frequently wrong in the sense that it's over or understated. Can't hear the announcements.,bart
836,4,"Jun 26, 2015","I just wrote a review for the AirBart and felt it necessary to write a review for it's parent:  Bart.  Also, I read a few of the negative reviews, as I tend to do.  I understand out-of-towner's frustrations.  As a long time resident of the Bay Area, I have seen how our public transportation system is no where near as convenient as Chicago's L Train or NYC's Subway.  In fact, it is damn difficult to navigate around the city.  If you do not do your homework in advance you can lose valuable time just working out how to get to your desired location.  Whether it's by Bart, Muni, cable cars, bus, or a combination of all of them; San Francisco is a mess.  I couldn't imagine navigating the city and trying to see the Palace of Fine Arts, AT&T Park, and the Painted Ladies in Alamo Park, all in the same day.  Whereas in the aforementioned Chicago and NYC, all it takes is a couple of transfers and you arrive within blocks of your destination.  So in this regard, yes we are lacking.Another area that they are lacking is in pricing.  Sure they offer a Clipper card with minimal savings on how much you load onto it, but for the most part Bart is not tourist friendly.  Cities like Chicago, Pittsburgh, NYC, and many others, offer a variety of passes that are beneficial to tourists.  Whether it's a multi-day pass, a week's pass, or a month, it provides tourists unlimited travel through their city's public transportation system for the allotted number of days purchased.  I don't know how many times this has saved me money on my travels!  Every time I visit cities with this option it upsets me that the Bay Area has been slow to adopt some sort of ""weekend pass"" that would encourage using their public transportation.  For that ... one star deduction.  For the reviewers from the Bay Area ... sure Bart may not be ""clean,"" but what public transportation system is?  You sit in the seats at your own risk.  Standing is ALWAYS an option, just make sure you always carry a thing of Purell ;)  I've seen the clientele that frequent Bart and am amazed that it doesn't look worse!  I think they do a great job cleaning/updating all of their cars.  Like some of the other Yelpers have stated, it sure beats the bus :)In terms of being on time, I have the Bart app on my phone and things thing has been a life saver.  If I am at the game, restaurant, or bar, I can plan my departure with the trains arrival to make the most out of my evening.  No wasteful waiting around for 5-15 minutes for the next train.  Sure delays happen, but for a system that runs all year they do a fine job.  Just make sure that if you are cutting it close that you just pick up your kids and haul tail to the station.  So to wrap this up, I gave it 4-stars because of how useful Bart has been for me.  For Giants games, city events, touring downtown Oakland or San Francisco, and getting to the airports, Bart beats driving.  Just plan ahead, estimate the time needed, and be fully prepared to see some interesting characters.  Sit and touch things at your own risk.  As they say ... ""Bart and you are there.  Boop Boop""SIDENOTE:  For all the visitors to the Bay Area ... Watch out for panhandlers.  They are more cunning and creative as time passes.  The last guy I saw was VERY convincing, but was a liar and a cheat all the same.  Do not fall for them.  The last guy I saw asked everyone in the Bart for their attention and gave this speech:""Oh man,  Oh geeze, this is embarrassing.  Hi everyone, and thank you for your time *insert fake tears/crying*  My son is at SFO and just missed his flight to Chicago.  He has $130, but was told he needs $300 for a ticket.  I have already collected $90 from the previous car, from such caring people, and just needs help to cover the remaining $80.  I am a Veteran of the Army and served in Iraq as a medic.  Whatever you give to me I promise to mail you double as long as you provide me your address.  *More tears and sniffling*  My boy is scared and won't ask anyone for help.  I need any amount for him.  Please help!""Needless to say many people chipped in.  From my estimation he made $65 from the car I was in alone.  Only reason I know is because I was sitting near the door to the next car he was going to hit up and saw the money in his hand.  Not only that, but the guy in front of me gave him $20.  Convincing right?!?  I almost believed the story too ... that is, until he moved to the next train car and started the speech again.  Guess what .... He still needed $80!  He just regurgitated the same speech he gave the car before.  Funny thing was, once he saw me (who he recognized from the previous train) he quickly collected whatever money from the car he could and got off at the next stop.  Why didn't I call him out?  I was so dumbfounded at the level he sank to.  Since then I have beat myself up for not exposing him, but here I am to redeem myself.  So ... if you see this guy (usually on the weekends)  DO NOT FALL FOR IT.",bart
837,4,"Jun 26, 2015","I am a BIG fan of Bart.  It is convenient, fast, and the easiest way to avoid traffic.  When this finally opened up I was excited at the possibility of finding flights out of Oakland OR San Francisco AND being able to access either one by a train system.  My big surprise was the cost for a one way travel.  It was $6 for this 8-10 minute ride.  This is my primary reason for giving it a 4 star rating instead of 5 stars.  Comparing it to SFO, the connection from the station to the other terminals is free.  Granted Bart takes you right up to the ""SFO Airport"" stop.  Comparisons aside, I am pleased that AirBart is up and running.  It now becomes another factor in my travel planning.  It all comes down to plane ticket price (out of OAK or SFO), travel time to the airport via Bart, and the convenience factor.  All in all, I recommend using AirBart, but just be prepared for the cost!  All things considered, some times the airfare out of Oakland is cheaper than out of SFO; when adding in the price of Bart it all comes out in the wash.

The Clipper often doesnt allow you to get through stalls efficiently, which results in us missing trains.

850,4,"Jun 29, 2012","BART is a good system San Fran has. I got a clipper card and it worked on all the public transportation systems in San Fran. The clipper card allows you to put any amount on it so you can charge the card for whatever you think you will use. Also, you can charge the card at a local Walgreens or at a local BART station ATM. The BART employees were help full and informative. I like the public transportation system you guys have and the connectivity to local buses is good as well.You do have to improve on the speakers and letting travelers know where they are and what stop the train is stopped at. I couldn't  hear a thing coming out of the speakers as to which stops we are stopping at and I almost missed my stop so you need better signs on what each stop is and the speakers need to be better as well so we know where we stopping at. Same goes for each station. When we are stopped at the civic center stop the maps there doent help much with the timing on when each train comes and how long it takes to get to a certain location.

852,3,"Aug 7, 2014","Overall I like BART but their evening/night scheduling is poor and could be greatly improved.  People will use BART more when the wait times are less and you can count on efficient transportation.  So instead of 10 car trains every 20 minutes at night you should have 4 car trains every 6 or 7 minutes so that no matter when you show up there is only a couple minutes wait to the next train - like a real city and like nearly every major public transit in the world.  Oh gosh, Stan, doesn't that mean having more drivers on duty?  Why yes, BART, but I guarantee that $30/hour burdened cost will be more than made up by revenue gains for what, five extra riders per hour, when people can count on quick and convenient service.",bart
853,2,"Feb 4, 2012","I really have no idea why people give Bart 3 and 4 stars. This is a 2 star ride at best and it only gets those stars because of locations and general safety (because when the Bart police will kill you crime seems to go down).I have been on trains and subways all over in the US and Europe and with the waiting times between trains, number of people being forced into cars because of the waits, and the price - they have a long way to go to hit a 4 star level or above. The smell is pretty bad as well - right on par with L.A. except with less exhaust fumage mixed in.At least with my hybrid I don't feel guilty taking my car and being clean and germ free upon arriving to my destination!",bart

That is awesome initiative to promote pubic transportation and raise awareness of the problems of pollution. So for that, I give BART 5 stars!",bart
855,4,"Mar 31, 2014","Overall, BART provides the best way to get around the eastern side of SF and the western side of the East Bay.  It is about as cheap as driving particularly if you are crossing the Bay and have to pay toll.  It saves time too - it can take an hour (sometimes over two even on weekends) to get from Berkeley/Oakland to SF during peak hour, versus some 25 minutes on BART.  BART is not too cheap, but let's be real.  It operates in the one of the most expensive areas in the country.  The Bay also does not have the population to lower cost through ticket sales, so I don't think comparing NYC's cost to BART is fair.  On a weekday, more than 6x more people ride the NY metro than live in the City by the bay.  That has to be taken into caccount when casting judgement between the two systems.BART is expanding their computer systems to increase the number of trains running, and they seem to be making some important expansions to the South Bay which will provide them a better way to get to SF than Caltrain, although the upcoming electrification of Caltrain will improve its service around the time BART reaches Diridon.  Now, the bad:  I am not going to complain about the clientele being rowdy, drunk, or homeless.  This is an urban metro system, you will have to deal with people that are not like you.  Yes, Ive on many occasions witnessed crazies or ""police activity"" between Civic Center and 24th st, but I have never felt in any danger.  I know this is a long shot, and there is a good reason for MUNI to do this instead of BART, but the City needs some better form of transit into the Richmond.  If not MUNI, BART should expand (or plan to expand) under Geary and eventually across the Golden Gate into Marin (which is the reason BART should do it instead of MUNI, as MUNI doesn't operate in Marin).  BART is expanding their inefficient E-BART service to Contra Costa, a sparsely populated area when compared to the Richmond.  Yes, it would be be exponentially more expensive to tunnel under Geary and build under the Golden Gate, but it would provide much needed traffic relief to Geary and the Golden Gate, as well as direct public transit from the rest of the Bay to Marin, northern SF, and Golden Gate Park.  This is what the City's traffic needs the most.  My biggest qualm about BART is its operating hours.  What will it take to get 24 hour service?  They always say that they need to close the Tube every day for maintenance.  I don't buy that.  Why can't you run single track between 1am and 5am?  What is the issue with having one train every 30 minutes cross the bay during night hours, exactly what they do on New Years and other holidays?  Honestly, at least run the Sunday schedule at 1/5 sunday capacity so people won't be stranded after midnight.  What will it take?  More ridership?  Well SF's population is expanding, and so is the East Bay's.  At least give us an extremely limited service during night hours.",bart
856,1,"Jun 26, 2013","BART UNION BOOOO - Shame on you.It is incomprehensible to the average worker, who has to earn their pay increases, (small ones at that) and has to pay for a percentage, if not all of their medical benefits, to watch the BART Unions bleed everything they can from their employer.  The BART Unions continue to drive our fares up and up and then takes as much as they can, so that there is nothing left to spend on decent facilities and services.  Shame on you for being so greedy!  When a Union steps in to protect the workers to the degree that they no longer have to perform, it is a slap in the face to the average worker.  We watch as BART employees do less than their best at keeping their stations clean and operable.  We put up with rude and mouthy BART employees that have NO sense of customer service.  We stand by, helpless, as the Unions demand pay increases and threaten strikes when people all over this nation are taking pay cuts and getting laid off.  On occasion a BART employee goes out of their way and has a nice disposition, but these employee's are rare and we thank the UNIONS for creating these monsters that feel they are owed unjust pay and benefits.Shame on you!",bart

Luckily I was able to take the Contra Costa County Connection express bus and leave the car at home, it was also useful with not being stuck in traffic with all the other morons who can't drive around here.2.  The trains are usually crowded, but before I even get to what goes on inside the train, let me elaborate on what's going on when you stand inline. People come in at the last moment and just pass you and the line like you're not there.3. Then you get to the train and things become even more interesting, you'll encounter all sorts of characters.  Homeless people whom you can smell from a mile away, mentally ill people who will be screaming/cussing and talking about all their problems, stuck up CA women who spend too much time on their smart phone and wondering who they will marry and how much money they will gain and the list goes on.4. Hopefully you'll find a decent seat without urine, feces or some other crap all over it.5. Then it's time to get off the train (MacArthur Station) and you can barely get off the train because of the swarm of people outside waiting to come on-board.  I usually greet them with LET ME GET OFF THE TRAIN PLEASE!! in a nice loud commanding voice (works most of the time).6.

858,2,"Jan 15, 2014","Works decently most of the time to fulfill its main function, which is obviously to transport people around the Bay Area. Unfortunately, BART lags behind many other public transportation systems. Trains are all old and clearly not designed to cope with high volumes of traffic, with only 2 doors per side in each train and transverse seats make for narrow aisles, meaning it's hard to move around within the car. No public information displays or automated announcements regarding next station or interchange info. Motors and screeching wheels get inordinately loud, drowning out the voice of the operator as well as any conversations you might be having. The cloth seats and floors all look dirty. No mobile phone reception in some tunnels. The fact that BART runs trains of differing lengths can be a bit confusing at first as well. Stations are all aging and definitely show it, although some modifications help a bit. The black vs. yellow tiles to indicate where the doors will be positioned are helpful, and there are screens showing when the next trains are due. Other than that, poor signage in general. A lot of stations just have that drab Brutalist look so it's hard to tell what station you're at. Fare gates are old and slow; Clipper card readers don't read the cards very well and it takes multiple taps to register at times. Ticket/Clipper top-up machines aren't user-friendly and are clunky to use. Cross-platform timed interchanges are perhaps one of the few things that BART has managed to get right. Clear labour issues; why are strikes even permitted for a service that's clearly so essential to the Bay Area? Staff, when they're working, are often surly and unhelpful. Fares are relatively high, although definitely cheaper than driving. Direct access to SFO is nice, and is actually a serviceable way to get to the airport if you don't have too much luggage.",bart

865,4,"Jul 13, 2007","I grew up taking BART, so maybe I'm just generous for sentimental reasons. For all the crap BART gets, they're actually a lot more efficient and pleasant to take than other transit systems in other major cities. Have you checked out the Paris Metro, the London Underground, or the New York Subway? (OK, maybe not quite the same as the Metro, Underground, or Subway, but along the same lines...) I can't speak to promptness but I can speak to cleanliness and comfort level. Considering the grand aspirations of the BART designers (cloth upholstery, carpeting, etc...) and the quality of a fraction of the riders, this crap is pretty damn pleasant to ride on. Also, aside from the sporadic tube fires, suicide jumpers, and criminal activity, there are few serious delays. A frequent inter-San Francisco rider, I notice the delays a lot more than your standard commuter and I still give them 4 stars. The smooth ride usually puts me so at ease that I am able to fall asleep and miss my stop. When this happens (which is often), I thank god that BART does run frequently enough that I can hop on a train running the opposite direction and still get to my intended destination in a reasonable amount of time. Minus one point for the ease with which the tickets demagnetize, forcing me to visit the little BART staff window at least once a week and forcing me to lose countless dollars throwing away the demagnetized tickets instead of going through the hassle of getting the demagnetized tickets replaced. The BART stations are also pretty okay, my only complaint is the lack of bathrooms. But that's just so people don't smoke crack in them. And crack is bad. So I can support that. Don't smoke crack and don't hate on BART. If they raise prices one more time, they lose a star from this rider.",bart

The BART restrooms are either always locked (downtown stations) or filthy and with a drug addict inside.3.  The air conditioning doesn't work in many of the train cars, so don't expect comfort.4.  The escalators in stations aren't always working. For example, the escalator in the Embarcadero station has been under repair for 3 weeks. Elevators are also unreliable, so pack lightly, you may be carrying your luggage for a long walk.5.  Bicycles have priority over any other passengers, so expect someone with a bike to push on the train no matter how crowded, rush hour or not. BART has no idea how to manage bicycles, so they just let them run rampant. You'll see.6.  Frequent breakdowns, police actions, medical emergencies mean that BART is extremely unreliable; you must have lots of patience to take this transport.7.

This bloody thing does not even attempt to connect the relatively small square footage (for a major metropolitan city and population) of San Francisco.  I get that it is for the Bay Area, in general, which is why I am giving it 3 stars.

891,1,"Mar 10, 2009","I'm with Matt H and give this incredibly craptacular public transit system exactly what it's earned - ONE STAR. (can't pick zero)I could write an entire essay on why BART is the absolute bottom of the barrel for public transit, but I will stick to a few points:-BART is overpriced - for a reason. BART executives make six-figure incomes each year, give themselves raises, and bonuses, and do virtually NOTHING with the excessive amount of money they abscond when you ride. When was the last time you got on an unscented BART train? When was the last time you stopped and thought to yourself, ""Wow, this is a clean station!""? When was the last time you were able to use a restroom at a station? And if it was recent, were you afraid to touch anything inside, including the floor?? The answer to all 3 questions: 1975 or thereabouts.Not only do Bay Area residents pay into the mediocrity which is BART through the 1/4% added sales tax, but many who DO pay that extra tax are nowhere close to a station! For the nearly $15 it costs to get to the airport from Contra Costa, what has BART done to show for it? LINED THEIR POCKETS with the money from yours! Which brings me to the next point...-BART is corrupt. ""Expose"" articles were printed on the front pages of major Bay Area newspapers a few years ago, decrying the excessive earnings of everyone from the execs to the drivers (who make $30+ an hour - to START!), and outlining in detail how corrupt and money-hungry the BART setup is. It was outrageous! It was appalling! It was upsetting! And yet what did the complacent, supposedly outraged Bay Area residents do the next day...?? THEY RODE THE TRAIN! Way to go, Bay Area. You get what you deserve.-Fares are more expensive than gasoline - even last year when it was over $3 a gallon!To drive from Pleasant Hill to SFO (roughly 40 miles) costs about $4.50 in today's gas price. BART ticket price: $7.05, which adds up to a staggering $14.10. In NYC, that would get you SEVEN one-way rides to anywhere on the subway. In Boston, you'd get more than EIGHT one-way rides anywhere. Distance-based pricing is a JOKE. But it certainly ensures the continued fat-cat salaries of the unionized lackeys running the monopolistic BART system. Oh, and if you're going with at least one friend on BART, consider this: Round-trip fare for two to SFO - $28.20; gas + bridge toll in a car with only 20mpg - $13.00. That's MORE THAN TWICE the cost. Carpooling for a night on the town? The per-person savings is a no-brainer, even if you valet your car in the city!-Inefficiency runs rampant, and is completely unpredictable.My wondrous jaunt on the illustrious BART yesterday took me from the Oakland Airport to Walnut Creek. Of course, I had to transfer trains, and in typical BART style, their definition of ""commute hours"" for the Pittsburg-Gun Point train meant that after 5:48pm, trains would only be coming every 15 minutes or so. Very practical. No shock that once the train pulled in (3 minutes late), it was packed to the gills and i barely fit in, leaning onto the ""DO NOT LEAN ON DOORS"" sign to avoid sexually harassing the people around me. These trains are about as punctual as Alaska Airlines, with the customer service attitude of United Airlines, and the trains look like a UPS package - beaten and filthy.-Smells, sights, sounds!Less than two weeks ago, I was again forced to ride the revolting trains to the east bay. As I boarded at Coliseum station, a mother and her boyfriend/baby daddy disembarked. Once I was on board, I noticed that they'd left a present for the next riders: a Subway bag with napkins in it, and next to it, a rolled up dirty diaper. Surprising? Not at all. So, attempting to be helpful, I picked the diaper up carefully and dropped it into the Subway bag and left it on the seat. When I reached my transfer station, I picked the bag up with one pinky finger and carried it to what I'd hoped would be a nearby trash can. Well, there was NO TRASH CAN on the platform! I ended up being forced to leave it on a bench. Maybe that teenage mom was smarter than me - she knew there would be few, if any, places to leave the damn thing!-Safety: Our Number Twelve PrioritySure, we all know that you may be one of the lucky winners of a gunshot to the back, but that's just the BART Police. When they're not around, there's no shortage of savory characters riding all around you. Even in commute time. Join in on a conversation the person next to you is having with themselves out loud. Rock back and forth in sync with the homeless. Pick up the beat of a nearby inconsiderate rider's blaring iPod. Bring something messy to eat - if it drips all over the seat, the 1970s upholstery will absorb it in no time.

For example, they paid some hefty sum to a contractor for some switching software, I believe, when the new extension to Millbrae/SFO was built, but that software is reportedly screwed up and trains are often delayed as a result, making commutes down there frustrating.  My understanding is they are sitting around waiting for the contractor and the sub-contractor to sort out who needs to fix the software.  This is sheer bullshit.  This is a huge public organization and it needs to grow some hair and start kicking ass and taking names until that software is FIXED.  I've heard the most laughably wimpy public statements by BART representatives on this, saying things like ""Our hands our tied, because it's a dispute between the contractor and subcontractor...""  My customers wouldn't put up with that, my public agencies shouldn't either. But while I'm handing out brickbats, the people of the Peninsula should be ASHAMED of themselves for rejecting BART--which is my understanding of why it doesn't go down the Peninsula.  With a larger rider pool and comprehensive coverage, and more frequent and fast service compared to Caltrain, BART could presumably dramatically increase its ridership to pay the general overhead and make a huge impact on the horrific traffic on our highways in these areas.   While San Francisco is patting itself on the back in being named this week the Greenest City in the country, the broader Bay Area should hang our heads in shame that our mass transit is this jumbled and poorly utilized.",bart

Why do the BART drivers have to mumble when they speak over the PA system?  Why do the tickets have to be paper tickets that bend and get de-magnetized if I keep it in my wallet?

897,5,"Jun 21, 2005","UPDATE: Bart now gets five stars because they have just become the only public transit service in the entire United States that makes it cheaper for me to drive my car wantonly through the Bay Area. Now I can avoid your piss-soaked, stinky service. THANKS!If I could give BART a half star rating, I would.  Bart claims that it is the best transportation system in the country.  The ads are plastered on trains, posters and in stations.  Oh, and by the way let's not call them trains.  Train implies that there are comfortable seats, nice scenery (not tunnels of darkness), amenities and interesting destinations (not Fremont and Richmond).  More like monorail.  Whoever ranked this the best system in the country has issues, or there was no competition; like a baseball team that wins due to a forfeit.  Bart is constantly breaking down, the system costs way too much to use for the distances that are offered.  It costs nearly three dollars to ride from West Oakland to San Francisco.  That is a distance of roughly seven miles.  You get no transfers so once you leave the station, screw you buddy.  Come back in and pull your pants down and cough it up for another fun ride on the single line going to nowhere.  The problem with the transportation around here is a lack of shared systems.  Bart, SamTrans, MUNI, and AC Transit cannot continue to survive working separately and fees for each will continue to skyrocket and make a trip on the London Underground seem like pennies.  Oh and don't even bother staying in the city for a drink or ten if you live anywhere outside the city.  Bart wants you to apparently get in your car and drive across the hideous Bay Bridge drunk, and failing that they would much rather you pass out in a heap on the electric third rail of their horrid 1960s designed beehive stations.  San Francisco is one of the best cities in the world, yet the main transpo cannot manage to run 24 hours?  Buses and transportation systems in Omaha probably run longer hours.  Next time Bart wants to crown itself the best transportation system in the country, they better at least ask their riders.",bart

On previous visits to the Bay area, I would normally either rent a car or drive my own vehicle to the area. However, on my most recent trip to San Francisco, my friends insisted that we opt for public transportation.We took the BART from a station near Oakland Airport to Downtown San Francisco (and back for our return trip). Certainly, the time it took utilizing the BART as opposed to driving in a personal car or taxi was fractional; it saved a lot of time (though there was a few minutes in which our train was stopped/delayed in the underwater tunnel). Moreover, the cost was certainly reasonable -- as we didn't have to pay for a rental car, fuel, tolls, or parking.All in all, public transportation in SF rocks! I'm a big fan now.",bart

908,4,"Sep 1, 2007","san francisco is regularly inundated with tourists. this review is for you. oh, and i shouldn't forget the locals who never ride BART except to take the train to baseball games.. this is for you as well.getting around on BART is easy to figure out. it is a train which travels on a rail in one direction and another direction (usually the opposite one) on the other rail. these rails are defined on a color-coded map which should look familiar to anyone from new york, london, chicago, atlanta, or any other city with subways. it's not even as labrynthine as it first appears - there are only four end destinations and five total routes. here's how to read this contraption. first, find your location/station on the map (here's a hint - there are signs absolutely everywhere in the station telling you the answer to this). now, find your destination on the map (no, ""san francisco"" is not a single destination). now comes the part you connect the two. if the line is blue, you'll be catching a dublin/pleasanton train or san francisco/millbrae train depending on which way you'd like to go. transfers are easy to figure out as well with the use of the map, some basic logic, and/or by listening to the train operator - because they announce details like that.ok, so congratulations on picking your route. now, there's a train coming. but where is it going? is it going your way? holy crap! this is where you freak out and ask everyone in the line or doorway, ""does this train go to san francisco!?"" well, all you really had to do was read the large-print, bright red LED signs above you because they tell you exactly where the train's end destination is. also, there's that pre-recorded voice announcing the destination of the train which may confuse some..phew! you are on the train you wanted - you know this because you interrupted two businessmen who were busy doing something important on their laptops. ""now what? there aren't any available seats!"" well, here's your chance to practice your balance - this is always more fun after a night of drinking. i suggest, if you've never ridden BART, to hold on to the disgusting, unsanitized rails above you, or near the door. this ride isn't smooth. now, if you fear you've lost the comfort and security of that map you saw at the station and are now lost in the BART system forever, do not fret. there is one mounted near every door. the fun part here is to stare at it, point, and make observations of what is around each station loud enough so the locals can take notes on this information.general things to know when riding BART:1) the larger seats by the doors are for elderly or disabled people, by law. if you do not give up your seat for an elderly person and you're a young twenty-something, be prepared to be harassed by the liberal denizens of the bay area. hopefully you feel like the jerk you are. also, if you are male, you are required by tightly held codes of honor to give your seat up to any female who may be standing near you. this, however, is not required by law.2) do not hold the doors open if they are closing on you. BART trains already run on some haphazard schedule that no one follows, so don't make it worse. also, these doors are stronger than you'd think and might take your arm off.3) most people are friendly around these parts. they'll answer some questions you may have, or carry on a conversation if they look like the type to talk, but that doesn't mean we want to hear you yelling into your cellphone about how you have been to many restaurants and still not seen the ""san francisco treat"" of rice-a-roni on any menu. we also don't want to hear your ipod.4) bikes are allowed on BART, much to the chagrin of bike-unfriendlies. do not feel bad if you have a bike (within the specifically allocated bike hours, of course). you're just smarter than those who don't.5) i wish the panhandlers would read this because this is where i'd tell them to stop telling us their repetitive sob stories, annoying people for money.6) and, finally, this one deserves capslock.. on the escalators, STAND ON THE RIGHT, WALK ON THE LEFT. it's not written in stone, people, but it's common sense.if you have further questions, or want to study the maps beforehand, refer to http://www.bart.gov. please note that, on 99% of the year, BART stops running around midnight, so plan accordingly.",bart
909,3,"Oct 18, 2008","It's difficult to accurately rate BART as a whole.  On the one hand, it's a relatively easy, convenient, and quick way to get around particular parts of the Bay Area.  It's also relatively clean, especially when you consider the fact that its seats are cloth and its floors are mostly carpeted.  On the other hand, BART is way too expensive for daily or even regular commuting.  They do offer combination BART-Muni passes and so-called ""high-value"" cards, but I don't consider saving only 6.25 percent a particularly good value, especially when I cannot buy these cards at every BART station.  Also, since you're probably going to have to add some money to use the card a final time, you end up losing some of that measly 6.25 percent.  And I'm not even mentioning the ripoff that is paying $3 extra to get from BART to Oakland International Airport.  (Thanks for making us pay for your poor planning!)In the end, I do like BART.  I mostly use it to get from San Francisco to SFO and to commute to Berkeley when I have seasonal work there.  So for me, BART serves its purpose.  But BART can be pretty annoying to get to if you live in the western part of San Francisco, and the extent of its Bay Area coverage is pretty limited, although I guess they're going through with taking it all the way down to San Jose.Strangely, I find BART the most efficient during rush hour, which I cannot say for Muni or any other major public-transportation system I have used regularly.",bart

916,2,"Jan 17, 2011","I've been in a lot of public transit vehicles, and none disappoint me more than that stinky train BART.First, I ride a bike. Oh no!! Look out grouchy old people & easily offended workaholics! I choose to ride a bike, because I do not want to have to take up two seats when I sit down & I think breathing cleaner air is important. I do not ride a bike to be harassed or scowled at while trying to get where I need to. Aren't there kiosks in the BART station asking people to ride their bikes to work more? Hmmm...how would I do that comfortably on your trains BART? CALTrain seems to have a whole train car devoted to their bike riding patrons. Should CALTrain ever dominate your tracks as the Bay Area transportation scheme gets bigger, I will advocate on behalf of my bicycling brothers & sisters to get their model approved for the expansion.Second, clean your cars. I know that BART is an underground housing shelter for the less fortunate...but when it rains, and you have fabric seats, AND carpet(which you are now getting to replacing with non-skid surface - 12 years later), the smell of mold & rot is somewhat unbearable. Why rely on chemical warfare to do the job your trains are already doing? My favorite is a regular commuter I would see, would floss his teeth for the entire 20 minutes he rode - flicking oral debris everywhere. I once saw a group of young men patting hard down on a group of seat cushions, which caused a huge plume of broken-down foam dust(with skin tabs, hair, fart dust, and God knows what else) to be released into the air. Their intent was to cover their friend's food with this dust. So, people eat on BART... When was the last time a citation was given to an eater? I see more drunk people on BART during game season than I do in SF bars!!! Seriously?! Tear down those decals that tell us where a train is serviced...instead have the folks who recycle materials to pull their carts onto BART to remove the waste your union paid workers seem to have a problem doing themselves.Finally, we come to service. I do respect the drivers & technicians you have working your trains. They are courteous, informative, & your backbone. Treat them well, because they are all you have going good for you. You should also treat your station agents better. They are in need of more help, since their attitudes are not always friendly. More help does not mean more people...because lets face it, I've had to wait for some to finish their personal conversations before I see a line go down. Give power back to the rider. Put out more information to them so that the station agent doesn't have to do every little thing. They work hard long days & nights...and some of your patrons on BART are less than well behaved. Your staff at the top have also got to figure out the BART police scenario too. Top execs collect a big enough paycheck, and THAT means you should know how to train your officers to do their job AND review them on a regular basis. There is no reason anyone should die while using your moderate priced transportation.I hope this single opinion shows how I have now come to rely on a bike or a personal vehicle to make my Bay Area travels happen instead of using BART.

918,3,"Apr 24, 2017","My first time.We took BoltBus from Los Angeles to BART's West Oakland Stn. and from there took BART to Downtown Berkeley to visit UC Berkeley for their Cal Day.For those unfamiliar with BART [Bay Area Rapid Transit] like we were, I have a few tips.From the West Oakland Stn. to their Downtown Berkeley Stn., the actual travel time is about 12 minutes.  However, don't forget to add the waiting time, which varies depending on when you arrive and the metro trains' schedule.   Although BART says in their booklet that they operate from 6 am to midnight, we learned that not all of their lines are operating during this entire time period or every day of the week.  Which meant we had to exit at their MacArthur Stn. to transfer onto another train line to reach our final destination.  This means more time is required for those planning on a tight scheduled.  The BART attendant can assist you if needed.The cost for our particular BART trip was $2 per person/one way.  The fees are posted on the wall near the ticket vending machines.  My wife, daughter, and I all bought our own ticket with $2 cash each.  Each traveler must have their own ticket.  You need these tickets to enter the train's departure platform and also again to exit the arrival platform of your destination, so don't discard or misplace them.  [When you've arrived at your final - paid for - destination, the automated turnstile kept our ticket after it was inserted.]Having exact change to deposit is preferable, but if unable, the machine does dispense change.  The posted instructions could have been written better on this subject, but weren't, which caused frustration and wasted more time trying to figure things out.  On our return trip, our smallest bill was $10.  The machine has a button to press for ""Multiple tickets"" [and then it tries to guess what you need].  It first assumed we wanted 2 tickets and wanted to load $5 per ticket.  Wrong.  So, we had to press another button to tell it we wanted 3 tickets [which the machine then automatically loaded $3.xx per ticket].  Wrong again.  The machine has a button to ""Subtract $1"" and another to ""Subtract 5 cents"".  Neither sum or choice was the correct change for our intended purchase.  With no other obvious option, we pressed the button to ""Cancel"".  After several tries with the same result, we complained to the lone BART attendant in the booth and he came to our rescue.Here's the secret to solve the dilemma.  After telling the machine you wanted more tickets [in our case, a total of 3], to get the correct change, you press the ""Subtract $1"" button to go from auto-loaded $3.30/ticket to $2.30/ticket.  Then, keep pressing the ""Subtract 5 cents"" button until it goes from $2.30/ticket down to $2.00/ticket.  Then, let the machine know you're done and it will return $4.00.  Paper money [$1 bills] were not dispensed as change.  The vending machine returns your change in coins.  [I wasn't looking forward to getting $4 in nickels and was worried when I only heard 4 coins drop.  It turned out to be four rarely used, but well-worn out $1 coins.]The BART system is convenient, but showing its age.  The public restrooms were reportedly gross per my wife and daughter.  Depending on which station you used and the social-economic level of its users and neighborhood, they probably have varying levels of cleanliness.Don't stand too close to the edge of the platform for safety reasons and never turn your back to strangers.  As reported on the news, there are psychos out there that shove unsuspecting patrons onto the tracks.  It may not have happened on BART yet, but it does occur.Be safe, avoid traveling alone if possible, and take care of yourself.",bart

921,5,"Nov 26, 2012","BART is undoubtedly the sexiest rail transit system on the West Coast.  It is a heavy rail intercity system, so it's significantly faster than light rail systems and features modestly retro sci-fi set-like stations (if you look carefully).  A great thing about riding BART is that you can relax or think about other things without worrying about all the impatient dimwits on the freeways or Bay Bridge.  With the congestion on Bay Area freeways, BART is faster in certain circumstances and can be generally relied upon to always take about the same amount of time.  Personally, I find BART to be a less stressful and hassle-ridden way to get from the East Bay to SF than negotiating the heavily impacted MacArthur Maze.  It's also nice to only have to pay a few bucks for transit fare and not have to hunt for and then lose an arm and leg to parking fees in SF.  Think of it as packing lighter for more freedom of mind.  I find that people complain excessively about the cloth seats and carpet.  Here are some thoughts:1) They aren't that dirty.  Stained?  Yes.  But are you planning on eating dinner or licking the seats?  Do you scrub your gums with them?  If you do so frequently, I'd cut it out because it's against the rules and defies common sense.  Otherwise, they aren't that big of a deal, warmer in fact, than the new vinyl seats they're installing.2) The vinyl seat ""solution.""  Firstly, yes, the vinyl seat covers can be ""cleaned easier"" if needed.  But do you really think that they're going to wipe the seats down every night if nothing has been spilled?  Probably not.  In exchange for a psychological improvement for the thin skinned folks who apparently have imaginary HIV, we get a clammier feeling seat that holds all the scary bacteria closer to the surface than on the cloth seats and a slightly louder interior.3) Regarding the carpet, it is also stained, but again, do you really want to trade a quieter interior for a grimy new linoleum floor?  The carpet may get ugly fast, but for me, a layer of cloth that absorbs some of the budget-cut induced rail screech is preferable to aesthetic ""perfection.""4) For those rude and condescending people complaining about ""bums,"" get a life.

The BART union has created this mess, diverting money to their overfed bellies rather than focusing on improvements to trains and stations.

926,3,"Apr 2, 2013","I have a love/hate relationship with the BART. I commute each weekday from the East Bay into San Francisco and I've experienced a wide range of service from clean & worry free commuting all the way to stinky/dirty & unreliable service.  I've seen people get up and offer their seats to elderly people and I've also seen homeless people passed out lying in their urine and vomit.   I've seen people leave packed cars so that others can get out at stops and also I've seen cyclists jam their way into rush hour packed cars and then block the doors so that people can't get out at their stops.  I've listened to amazing street musicians playing in the downtown stations and purchased their CD's and I've also donated coins to homeless families begging with their children.   I've sat in newly renovated seats and I've also mistakenly sat and put my hand in something left behind by a previous passenger that had not been cleaned.   I've been in trains that were on time, I've been delayed in crowded trains the trans bay tube for up to 40 minutes (unsettling at best).  I've seen posters cheerfully advertising $150,000 in salary for open BART Police job positions and then witnessed the glazed over look in the eyes of BART Police Officers telling me that no salary is worth the price that they pay for their jobs.  At the end of the day I can say that I take BART because it's there and it's a better option for me than driving, however, BART's far from perfect and I wish they would spend more attention to cleanliness, reliability, the riding experience, parking, safety,  and cost.",bart

Pros:--getting to SFO has never been cheaper or easier. The beer can on a rope to OAK is up and running as well... Crappy traffic will not make you miss your flight. --Reasonably punctual. --is cheaper than gas and insurance.--Less stressful than driving or riding--Great place for people watching.--With the introduction of the Clipper card you can get in and our of the station without fussing with the terrible ticket machines or worrying that your card will be demagnetized. A Clipper card is essential to your happiness if you ride BART often.--You always have an excuse to leave the bar. The train stops running around midnight. --Fewer panhandlers than other major citiesCons:-You never can remain at the bar until closing time--No public restrooms in any underground station.  This really stinks literally because our transient community has taken to using stairwells and elevators as toilets instead. It stinks figuratively because you also cannot use the toilet. Your children cannot use the toilet.  It's a major inconvenience. --most of the stations are poorly maintained and filthy--most of the famously well compensated ticket agents are not skilled in customer relations--the maps and signage are outdated and unclear,  even knowing which platform to stand on to catch the right train  is unclear.

I rode the subway for 7 years in Boston and nobody ever touched me (on purpose)--compared to most other cities subways (NY, Bos, Chi, DC) it serves only a small area of the city and leaves out a lot of important tourist destinations like the GG bridge --Its really expensive compared to other cities public transit: one-way is $4+ compared to $2 in a lot of other cities.  I guess BART goes farther distance-wise but still--Terribly inconvenient to get to the airport.   Millbrae BART and SFO are literally across the street from each other, but to get from Millbrae station to SFO station on BART you have to take not one but TWO trains!  Ridiculous!  And you have to take a Caltrain to Millbrae if you're in peninsula/south bay.  --You can't get a monthly BART pass, which is really annoying--Its really really noisy compared to other subway systems I've been onI just feel like BART really needs to make up its mind if it wants to be a commuter rail that connects SF to all the surrounding cities, like the East Bay & South Bay or if it wants to be a local subway system for the city of SF.

She told me that BART is a Public Transit System and BART has the option to NOT have the bathrooms available at anytime but if I really have to go she can open the bathroom for me.

We spent a few hours in town and went home.  Same clean car and we had our choice of seats.  I was amazed.  Then I moved to SF and began to rely on BART every day/night.  The stations became not so clean and the patrons not so sparce (or clean).  I've seen plenty enough to never ride the train again but the only other option is taking MUNI and that's another review.  For the most part BART is on time,  clean enough to stand up in,  and if you mind your own business - safe.  I learned the hard way a FEW TIMES that BART isn'tt open late.  And I have been short a few times and the attendants were cooperative;  not that they would leave their fortresses to chase down a jumper.  The homeless like to camp out in the stations which is fine with me;  better than being out in the cold and I've tossed a few dollars to some of the entertainers there.  The cars get way too crowded during peak times however and more than a few times I've given up my seat for an elderly person only to watch a teenager plop their sorry ass down.

The cool part is that it gets SF folks without cars over to Oakland, Berkeley and Daly City. My #1 complaint though is that it doesn't run 24hrs. UNREAL! What a waste. It's clear to me that BART is purely to make money off people who live way out in the berbs coming to work in SF during the regular 9-5 shifts. They do nothing for SF residents who can only get to a couple of neighborhoods. And they do nothing to keep the people of the bay area safe at night by providing an alternative to drunk driving to and from the east bay. If BART ran 24hrs/day (even at a limited night schedule) I would forgive all other follies.

It is very good a certain things - getting you from downtown Oakland to downtown SF and back, getting you to OAK or SFO without spending mad $$$ or getting crippled in traffic, and staying on schedule.  There are many things, however, which need to be fixed, and can be achieved without billions of dollars.  The cars need to have more doors and less seats.  The service needs to be expanded.  Now I'm not saying we need NYC or Chicago style 24-hour service.  All I'm saying is Boston or DC style, run a bit later and start a bit earlier.  Also, I don't get the focus on extending BART deeper into the burbs.  People who live so far away clearly aren't dying for the city life.  Now while I'm all about expansion to the burbs, an easier, and much more needed fix, is infill stations.  You don't have to build new tracks or imminent domain miles and miles of property.  All you have to do is plunk down a few stations between existing ones.  You gotta have 1 in Albany.  You gotta have 1 in Jack London, after West Oakland, but before going underground.  You can have a few more between Lake Merrit and San Leandro.  Having only Fruitvale and Coliseum during that stretch is a joke.  In SF they need a bunch more too.  Step it up BART!",bart

They prices go up every year, which is fine, but users need to see a significant difference in service and or train(s).  Last Thursday (5/15) I had the most HORRIFIC experience to date, well actually, if you give me some time, I'm sure I could come up with 3 more similar instances.  First of all, I knew there was trouble when I went down to Embarcadero station and the ENTIRE platform was flooded with people.  Also, there was a Fremont train with all doors open, and people packed to the brim, with others standing outside realizing they have to wait until another train comes their way.  I KNEW I had to just get out of the station.  It was about 5:15pm, and I boarded the on coming Dublin/Pleasanton train....it was FOUR CARS!!  WTF!!!  So again, everyone packed it in like sardines (with leaving people on the platform that couldn't fit).  The train went TURTLE SLOW.  Realizing that every platform was pouring with people, I off boarded at Bayfair Station to catch a Fremont train.  Again, the platform was FULL.  You would think that a breeze through the station would easily push 5-10 people to their death - or maybe they would be considered lucky for they would no longer be on the platform with 1,000 people.  I boarded the Fremont train, and as the train got to South Hayward, the operator said that someone had FAINTED on the train.  There would be another Fremont train coming on the other side of the platform and gave the riders 2 minutes to DART out of the train RUN ACROSS to the other side of the platform and BOARD ANOTHER TRAIN.  WTF?!?!  It was such a PATHETIC commute that there were even people clapping as we reached the Fremont Station.  I bet they were clapping for 3 reasons: 1. Couldn't believe they made it to their destination; 2. Couldn't believe they didn't need to TRANSFER to yet ANOTHER train; and3. They probably don't ride Bart on a regular basis and wanted to ""rub it in"" to those of us that do.As a consumer, when you are not satisfied with a service, in good faith the service provider gives you a DISCOUNT or REFUND for the awful service.

966,3,"Jun 11, 2009","Ever since I left my job in San Francisco and started working in the East Bay, BART has been my way of getting to work. I've gotten used getting there and having the train be pretty on time. It really doesn't lie about times except maybe by a minute or two. I just don't like it when they leave just as you arrive at the door and there's nothing you can do except watch the train go by and wait another 15 minutes during the commute hours. What I am not a fan of is/are people getting on to the train and pleading their sad story/sob story. I've been on a train where there was a regular asking for money for medication. They don't have enough for the month, etc. Then they get a phone call and break out their cell phone. Yeah right they're on a fixed income etc.The other was recently where a guy got on and said, ""Can anyone spart $6.00 so I can get a breakfast meal at Burgar King?"" OK, $6.00 for a breakfast? Where does he think he is? So this lady gives him $1.00 so he needs five more. He then goes to the other end of the train pleading for $6.00. HELLO!? If you asked if anyone could spare some change and or $1.00 you're more likely to get that then the $6.00 you're asking for. Damn, if you're going to pan-handle on the damn trains at least ask for a reasonable amount. Geez. You're not bright and obviously if you're asking for $6.00 it's probably for beer or something. My other gripe is when there's someone REALLY REALLY smelly on the train. OMG! The whole car REEKS of that guy! Can someone please do something about that?Since BART has taken out some of the carpeting in cars it's been more pleasant to ride. The new floors are less likely to smell like urine which is a big plus. Now if they could only change their seats to something other than cloth...When a car had no air going in and is boiling hot and there's a person that smells that's when I have to change cars. I'm sorry, but a warm car with a smell is enough to make me sick. If it's just warm I can fall right asleep. Except when there's some guy that stands right next to me as I'm trying to sleep asking for money.Don't scare me while I'm about to sleep. And please don't stand next to me if you smell.

The trains had plenty of available seats, after all it was before noon and many people were home recovering from their celebrations of the night before.  The train was of course with the usual suspects; one sleeping passenger on a seat looking like he had been there for several hours; another passenger with no shirt walking down the aisle with his pants literally falling down and he clearly had wet himself (just what I wanted to see); then the one goon who played his rap music so everyone in the car could listen to the m..f.. lyrics that are so welcome by all; and then the jerks that come onto the train sizing-up the other passengers and try to look threatening just standing there never taking a seat. Getting off at the Civic Center Station presented several misfits who were going-up to those waiting asking for a dollar.  They clearly were there to pander and annoy paying passengers.  How did they get down to the platform, they for sure didn't pay to get through the gates. Would have been nice to see a uniformed BART officer attending to some business along the way, but again never saw one. I know they are pressed, but really they could go through these areas frequently and make a positive difference.  The kiosk attendants should be monitoring the cameras on the platform and get security there and perhaps fewer of these misfits would be hanging around harassing paying passengers.

Three fatal shootings in three years.NYC Transit Police: 2,400 officers, no fatal shootings in the last ten years.Caltrain: 6 officers. No fatal shootings, ever.Why does BART need such a huge, aggressive police presence... and their own SWAT team, armed with automatic rifles? Do they intend to use those rifles on a crowded platform, or inside of trains?They have more officers per rider than NYC, by a large margin... which means that an average rider pays about 50 cents more each way to pay for salaries, training, etc. They were designed to be a completely automated transit system, with cars arriving every two minutes... instead, they are a huge, self-perpetuating bureaucracy. Willie Brown was right... they're transit police. They should have tasers, not guns.",bart

I'm guessing it's the latter.

While I understand a public transit agency cannot stop anyone from using the system, it doesn't feel safe, especially if you are using it during non-commute times.  There are a lot of homeless and crazies that move from car to car and train to train.  I saw a man sitting in a seat who was accosted by a crazy walking through the train.  BART does nothing (and I mean NOTHING) to make patrons feel safe; they have dummy security cameras in the majority of their cars!  BART has a ""schedule-smedule"" attitude; they don't run on time, are frequently 20+ minutes delayed and don't apologize.  The trains are pretty filthy; I don't know if they are ever cleaned.  BART also holds the entire Bay Area hostage every 3-4 years when the train operators union contract is being negotiated. During the last strike, I had to use AC Transit; the commute experience was radically different and I crossed over the to the Light Side.  Now, I only take BART when I have to (which fortunately is not very often).  Other major cities have larger systems and fewer problems.

Missed a train at 1am and there was another in 5 MINUTES! The Swedes know what serving the public is about. Barcelona has better subway service than BART. Amsterdam, Lisbon, Vancouver...Do BART officials ever take notes from other major cities? Oh I forgot, in America we don't fund shit, so I can't blame BART officials. When will BART stop using cloth covered seats? All kinds of who knows what is soiled in these seats. If you don't live near BART, it's a pain. to get there. By the time you drive/bike to the station, you might as well have driven/biked to your destination. Fares are always going up with mediocre service. How many times are you stuck and they don't tell you what the delay is about? In BART's defense, they don't have the advantage of developing with the growth of the metropolis.

The train conductors may or may not be morons, that is still up for debate. The station agents are indeed morons and there is no room for doubt there. I can't recall if I've met a meaner or sketchier group except for Hut people (not you Rajie!) than BART station agents. I've fallen asleep many-a-time on BART and getting back home is never easy because the trains stop running way too early. I'll never for the life of me understand BART's excuse as to why they stop running trains so early which is ""Maintenance"". Maybe you're just lazy and not very well managed. Because of this, countless people are put-out when trying to enjoy themselves. I can't tell you how many nights I had to end early because of BART. BART is like a demanding, possesive person who knows that you need them to take you to things and help you get around but holds it against you and controls you and always ruins your night because you need to eventually get home but you're on BART's schedule and BART is like the only person in the world who matters. BART has a huge ego.  Despite all this, I take this train at least 10 times a week because I work in the city and live in a land where Oaks grow and don't feel like driving. Call me a complainer, but BART is way behind on where it should be. Let 'em strike, let 'em eat cake for all I care. Just try and use bigger trains and run a little later into the night. Egomaniac!",bart
1037,1,"Jul 31, 2009","Sorry BART but in my experiences with you, you failed miserably.  I'm not even going to compare you to other transit systems in the world because then you'd look even worse.  Your employees are morons, your security sucks, your system with it's easily demagnetized cards is inefficient, and, really, you don't go very many places and where you do go is expensive.  Take this instance for example:I purchased two rides, one for leaving SFO and for one returning.  Aside from the bizarre machine that only allowed me to select an amount in $.05 increments [do you know how long that took to reach $10+?], the one leaving worked fine.  Coming back was the problem.  The card was safely stowed in my wallet, nothing touched or altered the magnetic strip, yet it would not work when I tried to swipe it through and told me to see an attendant.  My friend was already through and waiting for me.  Of course there was no one inside the two glass booths so I used the help phone on the wall and was told I needed to walk all the way on the other side of the station.  It was not a short distance and I was annoyed but off I went, leaving my friend behind.  I was met by three people all stuffed into one booth, talking and laughing with each other - why the hell weren't any of these people in either of the booths on the other side of the station?  The only one who seemed willing to bear with the inconvenience of helping me took my card with a grunt after I explained what happened, gave it back to me along with a dime [to this day I still have no idea why], said nothing to me and I walked back to other side of the station to go through the machine where my friend was standing.Again, it wouldn't go through.So I again walked all the way back to the other side and the woman said to me in a snotty tone, ""Uh, because you have to swipe it there"" and she pointed to the machines directly next to her booth.  Well, gee, wouldn't it have been nice if you said that to me before?  Not everyone is aware of BART's odd transit rituals.  When someone hands you a transit card, most people would assume you can use it in any of the machines in the station.So now I had to walk all the way back to the other side just so I could tell my friend I was going to walk all the way back to where I just was and I would meet her on the platform.  The cell phones did not work underground, obviously.  I spent 20 minutes walking back and forth across that damn station.  Then we somehow lost each other between the upstairs/downstairs but that's a whole other story.Oh and the scammers who stand by the machines and try to get you to buy their cards instead of your own - wow, way more aggressive than the people who do it in NYC.  This guy looked like an indie band hipster dropout and I had to tell him five times to leave me alone.  He [and others] were also all in full view of BART employees and of course none of them ever came over to question why these people were milling around the ticket machines all day long.  Way to go, BART workers!",bart

1045,2,"Sep 26, 2010","So, I finally made my first trip to San Francisco last weekend. It was supposed to be a quick weekend trip in & out of town. I agree w/ previous posts that ticket dispensers are fairly confusing & make you feel rushed getting through the gates & down the escalators/stairs so you won't miss your train. Arriving via SFO to the BART station onsite was relatively painless.The pain started in my ears as I sat right next to a door, sitting sideways for my ride to Downtown SF. The nearly deafening screaming sounds the BART made going in & out of the tunnels on the yellow line bound for Pittsburg Point made deciphering what the train conductor was saying as we pulled into each stop very difficult. The cars inside look old & the carpeting does nothing to change that appearance. (Can you imagine the germs riding along w/ you in the chairs & that nasty carpeting?) The seats were surprisingly comfortable - which had to be the best part of the entire ride. After hearing the noise for more than a 1/2hr as we got to the Montgomery Street stop. My ears were ringing for the remainder of the evening & falling asleep was very difficult as my ears just kept on ringing. Next time, I'll make sure to wear ear plugs when I hop on.The worst part of the ride was when I asked for directions to the street where my hotel was located. It was tough to find a BART worker anywhere in the station at around 10:45 in the evening. The worker I found pointed me in the exact opposite direction of where I needed to go, so I roamed around a cold, wet, & foggy Downtown SF for nearly 2 hrs until I finally came to my hotel. (I asked a total of 5 individuals where 3rd Street was & finally had to purchase a street map in a nearby 7Eleven b/c I was completely unfamiliar w/ my location). I was extremely unhappy that (aside from NOBODY in SF being able to give directions  - apparently that isn't being taught in schools anymore) the one person who should've pointed me in the right direction, simply wasted my time, energy, & left me feeling pretty helpless for a time. Certainly NOT a good way to start what was supposed to be a relaxing weekend in a brand new city.I'd rate the BART customer service at their stations very poor. I'd rate the ride itself OK as it did get me there safely w/o breaking down or me having to drive a VERY tricky Downtown SF street grid late at night esp. since it was so foggy that night. The trains rock back & forth - sometimes very violently - but it is cheaper than a cab ride from the SF Int'l Airport.I was actually resolute enough to brave a return trip back to SFO at the completion of my less than 48hrs in Frisco. Will I take the BART again? Most likely I will.",bart

1052,2,"Sep 4, 2014","I've been riding on BART since the 90's, ever since I moved to the Bay Area from Chicago. I've been commuting regularly into the city for the last seven years, as I would prefer not to drive and worry about the sacrilege that is finding parking in the SoMA/FiDi. If there was a more efficient, consistently-performing, cheaper alternative (we're supposed to have jet packs and flying cars by now, right?), I'd be using it in a heartbeat...but unfortunately, I have no other choice. But after having experienced Portland, Oregon's TriMet and MAX Line systems recently, I am just filled with utter frustration with BART.Sure, every city and state government has its' hiccups when it comes to spending on public programs. Since I am not a resident of Portland, Oregon, I don't see the issues that nudge at the locals. But in regards to their public transportation system, you see where the money goes.For the most part, their drivers are basically polite, and then there are those who are downright warm and friendly, without fail. How many buses have you been on where the disembarking riders speak or shout out a ""thank you"" to the driver? Again, I'm from Chicago, and I've never really seen that in my life!Don't get me wrong: there are very warm train car operators, booth attendants, janitors and police personnel who work for BART, but they are certainly a minority. Their example should be the majority. For example, there are several train operators on the Pittsburg/Bay Point line who I find are normal, friendly voices to hear overhead. They keep you posted on delays and sometimes you can hear that they share your frustration, too. There is one gentleman in particular, who states each stop clearly and sometimes gives additional information about the stop; he also speaks in Spanish occasionally! He also ""nudges"" commuters awake right before arriving at Embarcadero. That is someone who is good at doing their job and going beyond their requirements. This is what I like.Here is what I dislike.It's what you've been hearing from many, many people before, and unless some serious changes are made, you will continue hearing many more similar comments. Let's skip the whole part about these train cars being very old. Yes, BART has been operating since the 1970's (George Lucas fans might remember how futuristic BART trains looked like when they saw them in ""THX 1138""), but these train cars were assembled as early as the late 60's, from what I understand. The train cars are technologically outdated and just downright filthy. I can't tell you how many times I give off a sigh of relief when I am able to board a train car with a bare floor AND the newer seat upholstery. If the trains are being cleaned, they're not being cleaned as much as they need to be.New train cars? Hold your breath until 2017. Three years to wait. THREE more years of waiting.Fare enforcement? Practically non-existent. The closest thing I've seen of it was at Concord station, when a BART employee yelled at a guy who tried to ""piggy back"" through the turnstile. Unfortunately, I've seen more people---mostly guys---jumping the turnstile then catching a bus than BART security enforcing the ""no ticket, no ride"" policy. These guys are rarely caught, it seems.And why the hell are there buskers ON the train? Someone else wrote in a review about a couple walking through the train cars asking for money. If it was the same couple I saw, the husband was playing an accordion. An ACCORDION. What the hell?!?And performance artists. Really?!? I grew up in the 1980's in Chicago and not ONCE did I ever see that on the Ravenswood/Brown line or any other route for that matter. Sadly, I've seen this TWICE. If you're a performance artist doing a skit on a BART train, you need to find a better paying second job because your career counselor lied to you in high school/college.I think I've said way more than I needed to, and I'm not really saying anything new. All that regular BART commuters can expect are fare hikes in the next few years, just to get the kinds of service that other cities already receive for the kind of money they put into it.",bart

Compared to the 10 year span when I drove my kids to school in SF, then took MUNI and BART in to work, my commute now is a cakewalk.  BART is a 5 minute drive from my house and 10 minute walk to my office.  So I really shouldn't complain, but it is just inherit in my nature to constantly bitch and moan. It seems that nothing (or no one) makes me happy, or is good enough for me.  I hate when the train is so crowded in the morning that there are already no available seats on the second stop to SF.  Why can't they divert some of the trains from the Pittsburg/Baypoint line that arrive every 2 minutes, and spread some of the love around?  And if I want to get a seat on the ride back home, I have to hop on a train going in the opposite direction, get off a couple of stops down, then take my regular train home.

1063,2,"Oct 19, 2012","In New York, there is a MetroCard that offers riders the option of paying one fee for unlimited rides on buses and subways for a month. Same with Chicago's Metro system. Even Los Angeles's crappy Metro system offers a Metro day pass. But here in the Bay Area, we have to deal with overpriced transit from BART, who introduced what is quite possibly the worst possible system with the Clipper Card. You can't get a Clipper Card at a transit station. You have to go to a retailer like Walgreen's or Ace Hardware. You can't reload a Clipper Card at a transit station. You have to go to back to a retailer like Walgreen's or Ace Hardware. You can set up an Autoload for your Clipper Card, but you have to create an account on the Clipper Card website, and then call in to their Customer Service line to setup a security question, and then it can take up to ten days for your first Autoload to get loaded. Sigh. BART and its transit partners in the Bay Area need to look at New York City's system on how to do transit right, and dump this worthless Clipper Card system.As for the trains themselves, it's great they're finally replacing those disgusting old seats with new vinyl seats, but that's only a Band-Aid on a much bigger problem. Your cars are old, too many riders scoff at the rules of the system because there is zero enforcement, the air circulation inside the cars is lacking, there are too many bums who use the trains as their primary residence, and all this adds to an unpleasant ride. I only go on BART when I absolutely have to use it, which I try to do as little as possible.When I lived in Brooklyn years ago, my wife and I would go in to Manhattan all the time, because the system was cleaner and less taxing on our wallets. Needed to get from Coney Island to Dyckman Street on the New York subways? $4.00 round-trip. Round-trip from Concord to Embarcadero? $10.70. Both trips are about 26mi each way, so why is BART 2.5x more expensive? That $6.70 difference keeps me from spending $100 or more per lost visit in San Francisco.",bart

He cannot walk well and usually gets a ride, and hadn't ridden BART in a few years.. He purchased a handicapped-price ticket and boarded without incident in Daly City. By the 24th St station, cops were on the scene and dragged him from the train. (How were they alerted anyway? Is this what BART is using their $5.4m grant from Homeland Security for?)  He showed them his leg braces and Medi-Cal i.d. to no avail - it seems now you need to show them your Medicare card.

I took a train in the other direction to downtown Oakland to see if I could get on, but two more trains completely jammed with commuters passed before I could get on board.  But the icing on the cake was their announcement around Orinda that it was no longer a Concord train; they were turning it back at Pleasant Hill.

And when we got to Concord, BART had obviously done the same thing there to a previous train because that platform was full too.  This all feels like some kind of BART control center power trip!Random points on BART's inept inefficiencies:-The heat and air conditioning settings on any given car have nothing to do with external temperatures.-The digital signs in the stations that provide train times are right about 20% of the time.  The signs for which track to use to catch the appropriate train are right about 80% of the time.-The train operators are highly unprofessional with comments like ""I know it's tight, but squeeze closer and smile at your neighbor"" -- not what you want to hear when you're already 40 minutes late. LOTS of smart-alec employees making smart-ass remarks.-Big lead-in announcements, ""This is a special announcement from the BART operations control center"" to tell you which elevators are broken down.  That's just kind of pathetic.-The train speaker volume is often either so low it's inaudible or so loud it hurts your ears.-Their is NO coordination between Pittsburg and Richmond lines at MacArthur station and you are just apt to see train doors close in your face as you are to wait 15 minutes or more for a train.-The stations are filthy -- people-grime yes -- but holding the railing as I ascended stairs left my hand absolutely black with grime in Oakland tonight.-There was a bat flying around the 19th Street station tonight -- ok, not really a BART issue, but I was waiting for panic to set in on the crowded platform.-Changing the destination of the train during the trip is a major major slap-in-the-face to us riders.  It really kills any sense that you think they CARE about getting people delivered on time.-Raising rates, paid parking, paid bicycle lockers, in-your-face advertising that provides revenue, etc. with the trains, stations, elevators/escalators and service in such a filthy and unreliable state is incomprehensible. -No food, drink, smoking, loud music rules that are constantly disobeyed by those who don't care because there are no repercussions, except an occasional blast by a station agent through the loud speaker system that impacts all the rest of us.-There is NO use for BART time tables.  They have absolutely nothing to do with when a train actually arrives at a station.  Hilarious to see people looking up the times on these boards in the stations; waste of paper, ink, space, whatever.-BART technology and stations are worn-out vestiges of some prior decade which the agency fails to properly upgrade; they seem to have no interest in turning it into a world-class system, perhaps because they are already so far behind.These are just some of my observations on the BART side.  The commuters themselves should have a book written about them!  Strange, strange, strange ideas of what is appropriate and acceptable public behavior.I have major issues with the violent apprehensions made by BART police officers, but I have recently witnessed two different officers being exceptionally caring and nice to a person who appeared to have Down's Syndrome.  Those rare occasions are wonderful to see.I know it is better than sitting in traffic jams with people who are driving while using their cell phones.  I just wish I could afford to live within walking distance of my office!  I do find it astonishing that a high-tech center like the Bay Area can't have something a whole lot more reliable and user-friendly but affordable.My challenge to all you who feel the need to rant about BART -- what does that acronym really stand for?  And please don't tell me Bay Area Rapid Transit.  I want to hear much more creative responses!  ...more along the lines of Basically Awful Reliance-free Trains.Or, if you're more inclined, how about a BART subtitle that the agency could use in their marketing campaigns, like ""BART -- We apologize for the inconvenience"".I just needed to get a horrible commute off my chest, but feel free to have some fun with your public responses here.  :)  Oh, and don't forget ""to check around you for personal belongings"".  Shall I list those for you? ""wallets, cell phones, newspapers"" LOL",bart

1094,3,"Jun 14, 2006","I'm a relatively new (since April '06) daily commuter on BART.  So far, so good -- a definite improvement over MUNI (I rode the N-Judah to work for 3 years). First, the good: (1)  BART trains are much more comfortable than MUNI's fleet of light rail trains.  This is probably a no-brainer, but I appreciate the width of the cars (cuts down on the ""cattle car"" effect) and the fact that they have carpeted floors (which I like mainly for the noise reduction factor, and for comfort on those days when I have to stand, which is fairly rare). (2)  BART has a great on-time ""track record,"" with some notable exceptions (see below). (3)  BART's station stops throughout the Bay Area all seem fairly logical to me; the layout of the system was planned very well. Now, the bad: (1)  Many (most?) BART trains need to have all or most of their seats reupholstered.  Yesterday. (2)  Almost all of BART's fairly avoidable service interruptions seem to take place during rush hour (obstacles blocking the track, computer malfunctions shutting down the Transbay Tube, to name a few).  This is a mystery to me. (3)  As much as I believe MUNI needs to raise its fares, I also believe BART is a bit over-priced, and should consider evaluating its fare structure systemwide. Bottom line:  for the most part, BART is pretty da** good, largely reliable, and its service to the airports is always a better alternative to taking a cab or driving yourself.",bart

How do they not realize that these incentives will greatly increase ridership and revenues when gas prices go up again?     BART is always on time. But they are on time because they don't run enough trains to have a chance of messing up.  I also am surprised at the relative lack of crime with the missing security.  They barely have people at the booths, much less BART police (except at the coliseum).  Also, in response to a recent battery theft in my gf's car, all the BART cops say is ""don't come to West Oakland.""

If you have lived anywhere outside of a major metropolitan area then you know that paying $2.25 for a one way bus ticket that only comes once an hour, or even less frequently, totally blows and makes BART seem like its heaven sent.4. Comfy seats... i just try not to think about who has done what on them5. Feels like a roller coaster ;)6 . It does go to the whole bay area, or the important parts... news flash nobody wants to go to San Jose anyways and Marin can choke on a dick for being ""too good"" to have BART tracks running through their backyards.

Can be pretty pricey sometimes but that's what the emergency exit gate is for, am i right? ha just kidding....True other areas may have better public transit systems but if you consider the fact that in New York there are approx 2-5 million rides per day(more than all US public transit combined) or the Chicago ""L"" which has 658,524 each weekday compared to approx 380,000 a week for BART I think we have a pretty good system. Maybe if more people used BART we could get to a point where they could lower the prices and still increase the number of cars.

1119,4,"Nov 10, 2009","I can't believe I've just spent so much time reading reviews about BART.  I must really miss SF.  BART is an anomaly on the West Coast.  Where else do you have a rail system largely built in the early 70s that takes you to many of the big destinations in a metropolitan area? (Who are you fooling?  No one wants to go to San Jose.)  Certainly not LA, San Diego or Seattle.  What's great:- It's fast and efficient.  - It'll take you a lot of places in downtown SF (w/ connections to the Muni Metro & plenty of buses) , the Mission, downtown Oakland, and downtown Berkeley.- It feels like a rollercoaster.- Great views of the East Bay.- Relatively safe and clean as far as mass transit goes.  Okay, it's not Tokyo, but it certainly isn't as dirty and stinky as the NYC Subway.What's not so great:- Compared to other cities, it's kind of expensive.  (Compared to other cities though, getting into, parking, and leaving SF is expensive too).  - Save the Mission and the Market Street Corridor, BART doesn't really go anywhere worth while in SF.  A lot of non-San Franciscans and even locals don't like Muni so they don't go places BART doesn't go.  SF and the region as a whole would benefit from a line underneath Geary Blvd, and if a Geary line ever got built, then a Park Presidio/19th Ave line to Daly City creating a loop should be next.  (If only!) Why spend billions upon billions to extend service to San Jose and Livermore when hardly anyone out there is going to ride it?- The ridership may not warrant 24/7 service, but why don't you at least stay open until 3am on Fridays and Saturdays?  DC with a similarly aged and built system does it.- It's not very intuitive.  Thank god I started riding BART and Muni with the help of locals, otherwise I would have never figured it out.  Okay, that's my two cents.  I'd better stop now, otherwise I won't stop.",bart
1120,3,"Oct 3, 2010","3.5 stars...I don't have a lot of experience using the BART system but enough to voice a little review. BART is the subway/train system allowing San Franciscians to get in and out of the city and to bringing people to and from the airport. The trains and stations I found to be pretty clean, the seats on the train to be comfortable, and the BART map and automated ticketing stations to be extremely easy to read. Prices for BART tickets are a tad high (it's $8.10 to get from downtown to the airport), and at the moment there is no card to allow you unlimited access to all of BART and MUNI (though if you only need BART within city limits the Clipper Card would probably work for you). The system within the city is limited so don't expect to use BART to get around San Francisco but it is the best way to get out of the city for a day if you don't have a car. If you're more familiar with NYC transportation MUNI is like the MTA and BART is like the LIRR (or Metro North or NJT). I have 3 main issues with BART, first is that there are a few lines and it's not 100% clear which line you're getting on (only the direction), the second is that there aren't any announcements on what stop you're arriving at (and if there is an announcement it's completely inaudible), and the last issue is that when the doors open at a stop its extremely hard to figure out which stop your at because it's only labeled with small letters every 200 or so feet so you've got to do a lot of careful and quick scanning to make sure you're not missing your stop. BART isn't the worst sytem in the world but it definitely has its kinks.",bart

1136,2,"Jun 7, 2010","*Review is only about the situation that the letter describes*  In general BART is pretty solid.Dear BART-I am writing to express dissatisfaction with the strict regulation surrounding the usage of BART parking for regular BART patrons.  On the morning of Thursday, June 3, I parked at BART per my normal work commute.  However, I had a special situation--I would be traveling to a work off-site in a co-workers car (meeting my co-worker at BART to hitch a ride in the morning) but would be returning from work via BART to Walnut Creek (so needed to park my car).  Instead of making a commotion and trying to ""sneak"" by through the handicap gate to pay the $1 parking fee, I proceeded to explain my situation to the agent at the kiosk.  She listened and then strictly responded ""Unfortunately we aren't setup that way.  Parking is limited and we just can't allow it.""  I further asserted that if this were a normal morning I would have occupied the parking space during my regular commute (so the comment about limited parking was irrelevant to the situation at hand).  Had I reacted quicker I would have asked her to reference my EZ Rider transaction history--she would have seen my daily commute from the Walnut Creek to Macarthur station and understood that I was not trying to cheat the system.  There is a clear history showing payment of parking at Walnut Creek along with my normal faire to Macarthur and back.I didn't want to cause a scene so asked if I could enter and exit, the response I received was ""It's your choice.""  Because I needed to leave my car, I entered (as documented on my EZ Rider card history) at 7:37:58 and exited the gate at 7:38:12 after paying my $1 parking fee, a total of under one minute.  It's clear that BART has setup the system to charge potential parking offenders (that use parking when not using the BART system) the maximum one-way faire fee, as the charge associated with my entry/exit was $5.20. It is outrageous that I must pay the full one-way faire to enable a smooth commute the one day that I rode BART one-way.  I am completely aware of BART's need to prevent non-BART riders from parking in the lot (and I am in support of this), however, there should be some degree of common sense used by the agents.  What can be done to improve this system and correct this unnecessary charge?Pertinent information:Date/Time: Thursday, June 3, 2010. 7:35am Station: Walnut CreekBART Stall #: 40 (parked on the day of 6/3/10)BART EZ Rider: ****I appreciate your consideration and timely response.

Also, the parking situation in the East Bay is atrocious especially at the Fremont station. I have actually been hours late to work or school because I spent an hour or two circling the parking lot. Also, if you catch the train at its starting or ending point be prepared to have the train park on the platform with its doors shut for 10 minutes then sit in the stagnant train for another 10-15 minutes on the platform.

Let's hit the basics....A lot of public transit systems completely blow.  They're crowded, smelly, inefficient, and add time to your commute.  BART is SOOO not these things...WHY I LOVE IT-BART can actually be MUCH faster than driving when commuting to and from the city at peak hours.-BART say, ""Its okay Michael, I'll drive"" when I'm paper bagging my to-go cocktail in my Gucci tote. (as long as its before 12pm *see below*)-BART has seats that can be a little questionable and I have read SOOO many complaints on here about them.  Listen... STOP complaining that the seat appears to be dirty.  I'll let you in on the secret... THEY'RE DISGUSTING.  Its a petri dish.  Lesson to be learned?  Just don't lick the damn thing and you'll be FINE.  Its cushy and when I'm making rides in excess of 15 minutes I appreciate it greatly.-BART can and is most likely to provide you with SOME form of entertainment, be it a dancing naked crazy man, a glorious conversation to overhear, or watching some pornographically disturbing make-out session with either two gross middle aged to elderly adults or two pimply teens (and no, those are the only age groups who do that and you know it).  And lastly, -BART keeps the East Bay crowd underground and out of my potential street parking spots.WHY I DON'T LOVE IT-BART......... Bart, bart, bart.  You need to LISTEN right now and LISTEN GOOD.

Don't even begin to play wit me cuz ima take out mah hoops and fight chu.Do you even KNOW how man car loads of club crashers drive over the Bay Bridge to hit up city spots?  And I'll tell you exactly what happens... Tina (generic condescending female who is pretending to be matronly and responsible to avoid her serious relationship issues in that she NEEDS a man, a real prince this time, and can't seem to find one) says, ""Oh, I'll drive.  I promise, no worries... I'm super hung over from last night anyway (what, Tina, hung over from the lifetime reruns and Kleenex brand tissues with lotion to wipe away your tears of shame? No, you're right, it was probably those big plans you had... ha.)THEN Tina texts her ""BFF"" dude who lives in another city just to see what's up (not like she hasn't been in love with him for 5 years after they roomed together in college or something) only to find that he's out on a date with some tramp from the marketing department at his mediocre job thats pays way less than Tina's though she pretends that she's jealous to make him feel like a real man...  And you know what, I bet he's taking the date to Applebees or some shit like that.  Probably for the two for one happy hour on cocktails and appetizers...... or somethingWell WATCH HER!

1184,1,"Jan 22, 2016","FARE EVADERSIn light of the recent fare increase, I get quite irritated when I see a fare evader.  I see it occur about 3 times per week.  I see this crime so often that I now can tell when someone is about to evade the fare by watching their body language.  They begin to look over at where the station agent is located.  Often the station agent is busy/talking to another station agent/distracted/assisting a customer.  The fare evader walks to the turnstile which is located farthest from the station agent, and positions himself very close to the customer in front of him who is in the process of going through the turnstile.  Then the fare evader quickly runs through before or during the seconds that the turnstile gate closes.  Often, the fare evader has a very satisfied look on his face, that he never pays for a BART ride, and never intends to pay again.  Can you imagine how many thousands of dollars BART may be losing?  (And we, the honest people, are paying higher fares for?)  If me, just one person, is seeing the thieves evade the fare at least 3 times per week, there must be many, many more that are unseen.One evening recently at the Pittsburg station, I witnessed another fare evader and decided I had seen enough.  I went up to the station agent, told her what I saw in a loud voice, and pointed to the fare evader.  The fare evader saw me do this.  The station agent did not try to detain him.  She did not announce anything on the speaker system.  As I was leaving the station, the fare evader followed me and told me that he ""was tired of people like me doing things to his people.""  I assumed he was trying to make my reporting of his crime to the station agent into a racial issue (I am white; he was black.)  He kept following me so I turned around and yelled as loudly as I could, asking for someone to call BART police.  After 15 seconds of my screaming, he wandered away and got on a bus.  I called BART police myself, but they never appeared.One time I asked a station agent about the prevalence of these fare evaders.  He told me the following:  ""the Board of Directors at BART have instructed us to not to do anything about it.""Twice, I have called the ""Comments and Complaints"" phone line to voice my concern about this, and asked what is BART's policy on dealing with the fare evaders.  I asked if they could please return my call.  I have never heard back from BART.  That phone line is: 510- 464-7134.EATING AND DRINKING ON TRAINSBART has signs posted in the stations and inside the train cars prohibiting eating and drinking.  It is announced on the speaker system via a recorded message, and the consequence when caught is a $250 fine.  Yet there are a good number of people who ignore the rules.  I wouldn't care so much about this normally - but I have realized how these rule breakers can actually cause a danger to other passengers.  When liquids are spilled on the floor, passengers can slip and fall.  I was in the same car as a woman who spilled her coffee right before the train departed the station.  Then I observed how the coffee ""traveled"" all over the floor of the car, expanding further each time the train stopped and began moving again.On my trip each morning, the train begins to become very crowded, especially at the MacArthur station.  I see people carrying tall, hot, paper cups of coffee.  They are standing up holding the coffee, and they are positioned extremely close to other passengers.  If the train comes to a sudden stop (which happens often), and if that hot coffee spills on fellow passengers, then doesn't BART recognize the potential lawsuit(s)?Additionally, scraps of food, ketchup, mustard, and other food items are seen on the seats, even in the morning, when you would think that the trains should have been cleaned prior to the morning commute.  Shells from nuts and seeds, chips, Cheetos, open cans of soda, and water bottles roll on the floor.",bart

Don't worry about the crumbs, we know your blueberry muffin is clean. Don't worry about the spills, coffee is better than pee!""That homeless guy on the back seat of the car is cool.

There are handles everywhere to grab on to anyway. She is probably faking being old. She can stand fine, faker! There are too many pee stains but once again, Grandma is probably the culprit, the homeless guy passed out wouldn't do that. Crack make you sleepy, not incontinent, right? Perfect! The sign was right: that lady is covering the pee stains with her coffee!But let's get realistic:It is even more expensive to drive into the city.You can -but shouldn't- play Sudoku or read the papers while driving.BART is convenient for most commuters.It is very punctual except twice a year when it is a nightmare.There are no professional clowns on BART... but there are always funny people to watch or some happy ghetto conversations to listen to. It is important to be in touch with our time: some watch MTV or VH1 for the latest vulgar update. I ride BART! Once a week I get my 15-minute lesson on ghetto talk. I get to learn what my teacher's friends did to her, and how she is going to f&*#ing do all those things to them. Last week was ""How to pronounce the c-word"". Our teacher made sure we understood. She repeated it about 20 times. She is a great teacher and can really get the class to pay attention. That class was a special promotion: everyone in the car got to attend the class. The kids too! It was awesome!As a young man I always get a seat. I observe and choose my spot and my target, like a lion picking the sickest and weakest wildebeest, then a little push, a little intimidation with a light frown and of course, my i-pod on my ears. One quick acceleration, and I pass my victim. Once I have positioned myself in front of the seat, I slow down, I look at the LOOSER, give him a little smirk and  -very carefully- sit down. ""Sorry? what 's that? a ""jerk""? Hey, look at who's standing and all pissed off... the LOOSER!""All real men ride on BART. Real men are not gentlemen, they're tough men, strong men. There's nothing gentle about them. They will teach you how stupid it is to get up and give up your seat for a lady or an elderly person who will probably spend their day eating Cheetos behind their desk or watching a ""Murder she wrote"" marathon in their rocking chair anyway. They can stand, it is good for them. They should actually thank us, the real men!BART is great. Better to be in a grumpy mood altogether than alone in a car!

1187,2,"Nov 1, 2009","I'm going to review a couple things about BART but first let's all get this straight.  BART is an intercity transit system meaning it services within the Bay Area and BETWEEN the cities held within, not within one specific city (an intracity.)  So to compare BART to MTA (NYC) or any other metropolitan isn't fair.  They're different, get over it.However, BART could and SHOULD be offering a monthly pass, a weekly pass, student discounts.  Senior citizens are offered discounts but come on, what senior citizen would want to ride BART?I'd take BART more, but some, and by some I mean A LOT, of the stations in the more 'rural' areas (coughcoughGLENPARKcoughcough) don't have an adequate parking lot.  Yea, it can park about 30-40 cars (i haven't counted).  But do you have any clue to what's going on here?!  MUNI sucks, so I'll drive to the BART station, I can cross the bay via BART, but where am I to leave my car?!  Seriously, build a freakin' parking GARAGE.  The BART Union is screwing you (not literally, I hope...)  BART employees are, on average, paid more than any other public transit agency in the Bay Area's, if not state or country's.

1188,4,"Aug 16, 2010","BART rapidly became my favored way of getting around the City -- for an out-of-towner it was a lot easier to figure out than Muni.  Occasional panhandlers hang around to hit you up when you're getting tickets, and I was told to avoid the Civic Center Station, so I did.  Otherwise, I had no trouble getting from my hotel in the Mission district to downtown tourist destinations.  One side goes north; the other goes south -- and all trains stop at all the stations in the City.  It couldn't be easier.",bart
1189,3,"May 13, 2011","Oh, where to begin.  The three stars say so little.  First, BART is on time.  I have only very rarely been inconvenienced by a slow-down in traffic on BART, and almost ALWAYS inconvenienced by traffic when driving in SF.  And let's not get started about parking.   Second, I have not had the dismal experiences with fellow passengers described by some of the other yelpers; in fact, I find my fellow BART passengers endlessly fascinating, especially when the entire Raider Nation gets on in Richmond.  (OK, there have been a couple of very smelly, scruffy, out-of-it persons with whom one would prefer not to share an upholstered BART seat.  And suspicious substances on said seats.  But not as a general rule.)   I believe in BART, especially in principle.BUT.  I used to live in NYC, so I know what a working mass transit system looks like. And I can say the following:BART is too expensive.   It should be cheaper AND have more trains and cars so that we would have MORE riders at lower prices.  As is, lots of folks prefer to drive for understandable reasons, which sucks.  BART is not sufficiently extensive within the city of San Francisco and/or not sufficiently linked to MUNI.  The whole BART/MUNI disconnect can ruin your experience of public transit in the Bay Area.  BART is great for suburban commuters to downtown, but a fail when it comes to the city.BART should run 24 hours.  I say this as a person who lives along a BART line and experiences BART noise at close range.  It should run 24 hours so that a person can actually use it to get to the airport at dark o'clock.  So that people who work late or party late (especially those who party late and imbibe mind-altering substances) can get home safely.BART should have better signage for its stations.  A person new to town is lucky to figure out where the heck s/he is with those dimly lit stations and tiny, subtle station signs.  Still, I believe in public transportation, and at least people ride on BART, which is more than I can say for the subway in LA.  Go BART.",bart

The world famous underwater bay area rapid transit tube. I have been through it a million times and frankly is just fine. It is very noisy and I like to complain about cellphone service. Since it costs a fortune to have cellphones and ""technically"" service is available and good would it not make sense to have consistent and reliable service in there? I hate cellphone use in the tube. TMO never worked. Of recent use I hated Sprint. Data never worked when trains moved unless you were locked in a signal at a station. Sprint is gone bye bye and now ATT? Sucks. The curse of the tunnels? Fix it. Damn it. Half of discretionary income of all stupid people with no income goes to cellphone bills and does not work when there is nothing to do and want to use it! The tunnel is good however.

A redo of the interiors to something more modern and practical is long overdue.- I swear they must be purposefully hiring people who speak English as unintelligibly as possible, and then give them training in mumbling in their own imaginary language, to make the station announcements.- The ticket machines are outdated and not very user friendly.",bart

When we arrived at the pedestrian bridge linking the stadium and BART we found it packed with thousands of people and two measly 4 car trains visible waiting on the platform. Historically I have taken BART to concert events. They had two years advance notice of this sold out concert and they made no preparations to accommodate the needs of the  riders. Thousands were left stranded. We were lucky. We only rode one stop and were 18th in line for a taxi.",bart

1200,2,"Jan 27, 2012","BART is pretty much a so/so transit agency for me, and there a few pro's and cons to take into consideration about them. First the good things  The trains are regular enough (more regular then most of the buses I have to wait on) and you have the added benefit of not worrying about traffic. There is also the fact that you pay depending on how far you travel, so if you want to only go a couple of stops you end up paying a rather cheap fare.  They are on Twitter so you can see if there are any delays, this isn't the most reliable thing, but I appreciate the effort none-the-less Now the bad things.  The trains are absolutely filthy, especially those horrible fabric seats that are covered with stains (don't want to even think of their origin). These same seats are often covered in a myriad of trash, mainly in the form of newspapers, which makes traveling on BART a not very pleasant experience.  Stations and their surrounding areas are not that well lit at night, which means I avoid traveling through them after dark if  I can. Especially the Fruitvale station which is the one I use most regularly. You'd think with all the money they have they could afford to put more lights up. Panhandlers are regular sights on both trains and their surrounding areas, more recently people have started trying to sell off tickets brought with stolen credit cards. This makes walking into a station an occasionally nerve wracking experience. The announcements for next stops on the train are often very muffled, which makes it hard to know which stop is coming up ... It worries me as I'd hate to think of the confusion and chaos that would occur during an natural disaster, or if some other emergency situation where to occur.  The worst for me is that air conditioning in some of the trains doesn't work in the summer. Being in a train, crowded with people, and no opportunity to open a window really is the pits.",bart

The biggest con of the Bart that it stops at midnight, which is not very helpful if you want to come to SF on the weekend and drink. I am sure that Bart could save lots of people's lives if they could take the Bart at 2:00AM and wouldn't have to drive under the influence back to their homes. But, at least we have it.

I should have caught it. I live here. Ok, so we had wine with dinner.Duh.He negotiated a $3 exit with the Station Meister.  Now he has $17 in singles with which to buy future BART cards more exactly.You would think that BART would take advantage of all of the software smarts in the area to devise vending machines that either make change or allow people to buy more convenient amounts on their swipe cards.  After all, London can manage that -- and it is not a city renowned for its software industry.  But then again, the BART vending software likely was designed in 1975 by a transit system functionary, before software took off in these parts.Will that card he gave me ever be usable since it has an unused, open exit on it?

However, I have one glaring issue with this new Millbrae transit center and SFO spur which is set up all wrong.  You can't long-term park in the BART parking lot, so what is the use of having a spur to SFO if you can't park your car?  You can't even park overnight on weekends when most people are taking their trips. What are you supposed to do, park a half mile away in some residential area or take your chances in a strip mall lot and ride your skateboard over to BART with your luggage foisted on your back?  That makes no sense. I thought the whole idea was to provide a convenient alternative to the other airport transit options and to reduce traffic congestion?

At $10.25 per person for one-way fare, it was double what I was used to paying at home (for going the same distance). The cloth seats were a bit worn, the cars were dirty, and it had a strange smell. The ride to Concord was fine--the trains are a bit jerky and it is noisier going through tunnels compared to home. They utilize more cars (10 versus 8/6 back home). It was hard to hear the driver over the PA as well. We spent a few days in SF during our trip and even though there was a station near our hotel, it was just easier to walk or take the car to wherever we needed.

But, I decided to give it a shot and started becoming a regular rider. The interior is always clean, the seats just got replaced from cloth to vinyl, and in my experience, the trains have been on time. The only problem I have is the expensive fare.

The stations were havens of bum pee and intravenous drug injectors and worse. If you want to experience a waking nightmare, check out Bart on a bad day, which they have at least three times or more a week. I now use MARTA (Metro Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority or something) and it's far better: cleaner, more polite and sane people, better views, mostly reliable, and -- despite criticisms to the contrary -- it has a lot of stops inside the Atlanta perimeter (ITP). Once I started using MARTA -- which isn't perfect; nothing is -- I realized how poor Bart really is. You'll find Bart is a third world experience for first world prices.

Here are my main thoughts on the subject.  Despite being corrected about my earlier assertion that BART is a private for-profit company (tip o' th' pin to Andrew S for the heads-up), the fact remains that--for whatever mysterious reason--BART is outrageously expensive.  It's just embarrassing to go back east and ride Boston's rail system, for example, which will take you anywhere the rails go for a buck.  Period.  Doesn't matter how far you go or whether you have to transfer to another line.  It's just a buck.  On the other hand, it's true that, for the most part, BART is pretty clean and timely and efficient.  In this congested part of the world, with some of the stupidest and most outrageous traffic I've ever seen, sometimes BART is simply the way to go--especially for one-time or occasional events.  I was also initially vexed by the very limited service offered by BART, but this is a complex region for any one transit system to cover by itself, and with MUNI and Caltrain around, no one system has to.  You just have to get used to the idea of combining multiple transit systems to get where you need to, and then weigh that option against the pros and cons of driving...and parking.

It gets 3 stars for just being BART and mostly providing reliable service for the majority of the bay area. Marin County could use it, but that's a marin issue and not a BART issue. I guess they're too good for BART or something.  BART isnt very clean, but it's about what I'd expect for mass public transportation.  The station agents have been hit or miss.

And I wonder what the hell BART is talking about when it proudly advertises that it was voted the #1 public transit in the country.  First of all, in a major metropolitan area with plenty of night life, it's a travesty that the last train leaves the terminus at midnight.  This discourages people from taking BART or going out altogether, or worse yet, some people may decide to drink and drive.  Second, it costs over $6 roundtrip from the East Bay to SF, much higher than comparable trips on a lot of other US public transit systems, and more expensive than in Japan where the cost of living is way higher.  Third, they keep cutting back on the staff and the train length because of budget cuts--one time, my ticket got stuck in the fare machine, and I had to wait for 45 minutes for an agent to show up and retrieve it for me.  At least it wasn't an emergency, but what if you DID have an emergency?  And finally, it's just insane or stupid or both to have carpeted and upholstered cars!  Some cars stink of yesteryear's spilled latte...and how much of the shrinking budget is being spent on cleaning or replacing the cloth interior?  And they're talking about raising the fares again.

1241,3,"Oct 10, 2011","i flew up to oakland from orange county twice this year for two different job interviews, and on both occasions, i utilized BART. i must say, coming from So Cal, this type of public transportation would make life so much easier down here; i probably wouldn't ditch my car in lieu of public transportation, mainly because i enjoy driving, and having a car to escape the city is vital. while i love the idea of taking a subway to work, the novelty of the BART would undoubtedly wear off, as i did notice that the majority of people riding the BART looked dazed, lifeless, and relatively unhappy. as well, the last thing i want to worry about after having a bad/long work day is an on-time train, and having to sit next to someone and force small talk. I know that if i lived in the bay area, i'd probably assimilate to taking the BART on a daily basis, and i would probably save $ in the long run. i guess i am basing this review from a 3rd party perspective, as i do not live in the area, but i promise to update this review if i do get one of the jobs in which i interviewed for...",bart

I like the convenience of taking Bart but it's really starting to show it's age. The cars aren't very clean, the carpets and seats are starting to turn gray and it's not unusual to find bits of garbage wedged between the seats. Some are starting to smell gross. Also because of the terrible traffic in the Bay Area I think they should expand the line to more locations, like out to Tracy and to more places in San Francisco. The public transit system for the Bay Area really needs work! Still tons of people use Bart everyday so its not surprising they aren't working harder for their money. Also when I ride Bart there are points when it screeches really loudly when going over the track, too loudly to talk. I will continue to take it to the airport as it's more cost affective then driving because of the current gas prices but its not as enjoyable as it could be. I've also gone through the experience of the demagnetized Bart cards and it is a pain to get a new one. The Bart drivers are very nice and I have never had a problem with them. Some of them do mumble the station stops though. Bart should totally clean and update their cars.",bart

Plus even for a LA Native, the drivers in San Fran are CrAzY!!!! AND seriously the carpet and cloths seats were bothersome to me. I was disturbed by the thought of the all of the riders through the years, bacteria and the fact that I was wearing a dress.

It costs too much, the trains are always breaking down, people drive through the parking lots like frickin' maniacs, the cars smell, 1st rainy day always causes delays, it's noisy (especially underwater) etc. etc. etc.  Well, ok, true.  :)  But let's take a step back for a second and think about all the times you've rode to BART flying past commuters jammed into their cars.  Think about the books you've read, the naps you've taken, or just the relaxing view out the window, allowing your brain to turn off as you listen to your ipod while cruising along.  And while you remember the day the system broke down or made you late, if you're a regular how times has it gotten you where you want to go when they said they would?  I've been riding it regularly for three years and have to honestly say it gets me to work and back home again on time at least 95% of the time.  BART is FAR more predictable than driving.  Frankly, that's fine with me.  The main flaw with the system today was that it was designed solely to promulgate suburban development and was viewed more or less as a tool for getting suburbanites to their jobs in the city and then home with a minimum of fuss.  That was the thinking of the day and hence it is the system we have now.  Now, many of those office jobs are in the suburbs and the inner Bay Area is becoming increasingly urbanized.  BART needs to change to meet the times.  More trains for example with some of them being express (meaning they skip through some low density stations like South Hayward).  24 hour service, and doing everything to convert BART parking into housing, jobs, and recreation.",bart

It was strange that each train goes one way, as opposed to taking the L line inbound or out, you just take the richmond line and it only goes out.  Inside, the seats were all fabric!  But, they were too low. I'm short, and my legs felt weird. What about the tall people?  It was much less crowded, which was good, because i had NO IDEA where i was going.  There was nothing to tell you where you were, and i could barely see the signs outside.  At one point, i had to stick my head out of the train to see if i was at berkeley center yet.  When i got out, i discovered i had to pay to leave!! I had just used my muni pass to get in, but i guess that only works for in the city.  I paid the attendant $3.25 and she let me go.  What if i hadn't had it?  Do they keep you on there, like the guy in that boston song the man who never returned?  The way back i had to switch trains, but the connecting one was waiting for me. However, i would have never been able to figure that out for myself.  Some ways i like muni better, but this is probably more reliable.  Bad points for closing early at 12!",bart

So for all you newbies, NO your train will not arrive at your station at 3:03.  But if it is on time, the bart will leave your A** even though it sees you running for it.  Yeah, there is the case where you have OVERZEALOUS train operator, who stops for EVERYONE attempting to catch the train, and makes you even later, but that's more an exception, not a rule.  Don't get me started on their ingenious idea about UPGRADING their software during peak commute hours.  Yeah, only the BEST Transit Agency would think of something so customer-centric.  Some BART Stations are definitely better manned than others though.  As a frequent rider from the Richmond station, the station agents don't give a Rat's Derriere about what you do.  People smoke while waiting for the train, whereas at Macarthur Oakland, the Station Agent will get on that speaker and tell you to kill that cigarette.  It serves it's purpose, at the very least.

So when I have to somehow get from SFO into the city, I was like, do I take a taxi, a shuttle, or a limo?  It didn't even cross my mind to take the BART.  Yeah, right.  I won't even take it if it was just me, and with all my craps (I'm NOT a light packer), there's no way I'm taking it.  Then my friend Susan was like, it's not that bad.  It's so easy, blah, blah, blah.  She sent me the link to the schedule and everything so I was like fine.  Since I was poor due to too much shopping earlier in the month, I was willing to try it.  And it was not that bad!  I got off the plane, got my luggage, took the Air Tram or whatever it's called from the terminal to the BART station.  I had to run so fast, but I made it just in time for the BART.  Bought the ticket (a lil annoying with they way it makes you add the money then minus $1, minus 5 cents, minus 5 cents and all that.  Can't the ticket fee be the exact dollar like $1 or $2 instead of like $1.35 or $2.15 or something lame like that.  Anyways, I got on the BART ok.  The website was definitely helpful cuz it gives me the time that BART was coming (hence the running part), and it also told me which station to get off and how much the ticket will cost me ($6 minus 5 cents, minus 5 cents, minus $5 cents, minus 5 cents).  So definitely check the website out before getting on it.  The only other complain is the stupid speaker/intercom system.  It was so crappy I couldnt' hear what the conductor was saying.

1262,1,"Nov 19, 2008","In the wake of a profound post World War II residential and commercial resettlement, coupled with the consequent elevation in automobile demand, Bay Arians faced an escalating overpopulation of highways and bridges spanning the bay. Thus the BART was born, a system created to deliver the Bay Area to the doorstep of the next generation in public transportation HAAHAHAHA. Wow, really? Did you just read that too? I mean, seriously? Cummmmon!! CUMMMMMMMMON!!! Oh well, back to my point. In today's world, the trend towards highly selective career placement is skyrocketing and companies are forced to draw resources from a wider array of loosely connected cities at all Cardinal points of the Bay Area. In addition, corporatization is replacing the Mom and Pop shops with high rise economic giants and industrial machines staffing millions of ""blue"" and ""white"" collar workers as well as specialized labor in areas where residential limitations restrict the amount of local hiring available. The non feasible solution: double the number of Bay Area bridges from 6 to 12. The more practical solution: expand the Public Transportation system. The Problem: career opportunities have expanded, the population has expanded, technology has expanded, the movement towards a leaner, greener, less carbon, more enviro-friendly society has expanded, but the BART....it hasn't expanded and it is now itself a victim of overpopulation. Unfortunately, I am a number in the system, a sprocket in the machine, a working American plagued by the dilemma of fluctuating gas prices and the possibly devastating effects of green house gasses on the future of our planet.....well the BART actually zips me over traffic and cuts off an hour from my commute home but I do care about the environment too. Though each BART car has its own personality, its own sounds, squeaks, rattles, jars, pungent aromas and creepy BART engineers announcing over the speakers, ""Maaaaaaaac Arthur Station, our nnnnnnnext stop is Maaaaaac Arthur Station, your final traaaaaaansfer point for Freemont bound passengers,"" in a very Charles Manson-ish voice; there is one similar aspect of every BART car that I have come to accept, overpopulation. Every day, millions of numbers, millions of sprockets pile onto the BART telling themselves that they are getting to work while simultaneously saving the environment, assuring that little Billy has green trees to climb when he grows up, but in actuality, they're simply making an effort to save a little gas money and avoid the devastating consumption of the highway system by automobiles and there blaring horns. This overpopulation of the BART system, in essence, creates individual cities within each car. Excessive amounts of people with multiple occupations, cultures and religions pile into an area which, geographically, is ten times too small. BART personalities run rampant: the lotion salesman who sells Dixie cups full of lotion which he pours from a large container with no visible seal guaranteeing you that it was purchased and not made, the struggling musician that paces the overcrowded isles playing guitar gibberish, begging for money and sharing his lifelong story, the bums who only contribute to the already visible aroma and try to pawn stolen BART tickets, and the crazies who yell and scream about things that only themselves in their insanity can understand. Hormones elevate as the competition to attain the best seat, or ""a"" seat plays out, or the elderly and handicapped try to capitalize on their federally assigned seats, and involuntary exchanges of bodily secretions due to the close proximity of fellow passengers occurs. With each stop, more and more sprockets board the vessel shoving you closer and closer to the person behind you, into that small area of space surrounding a human being where you can actually feel their emission of body heat and warm moist expulsions of breath trickling over your skin. The BART has its own set of cultural standards as well. In everyday life, we know our personal boundaries and those of others because they have been engrained into our very existence since our birth. On the BART, different rules apply. Phrases like, ""excuse me,"" or ""Thanks for that taste of arm pit,"" or ""watch where you're sticking that thing,"" are replaced with grunts, groans and tolerant sighs because intolerance is not accepted on rapid transit. The air becomes so thick that you can feel its texture. The only thing that is stopping you from reaching up and grabbing a handful of it is the fear of what you will actually grab, and not having a place to wipe your hand off afterwards. AAAAAUUUUGGGGH!!! DEATH!!!  So as I am gliding over the freeway on an elevated track with my face smashed up against the glass window and three different people breathing down my neck, I sit in envy of the poor bastards stuck in miles of traffic, crawling down the freeway, laying on their horns and cursing the day they were born...I long to feel their misery",bart

If you drive during commute hours, pick up carpooler(s) at many locations in the East Bay and ride through in the carpool lanes on the left and right sides of the toll approach. During the week end, the slog is a lot slower and toll more expensive but driving will guarantee you comfort (you get a seat), reliability (cars seldom break down on the bridge but BART does more often), company (some of the folks on BART are unseemly) and you won' t get robbed or mugged by BART (expensive fares), by shady characters in the train (bags have been stolen from under the seats) or at stations located in less than safe neighborhoods (pretty much anywhere on the BART network since their stations attract that kind of activities). I still ride BART when I have to but I would rather not. I almost forgot about bikes. Expect your space to be taken over by bikes and their riders and your trouser legs to be smeared by dirty tires. Finally, the cosseted and much maligned transit police is seldom to be seen and prefers to ride around in taxpayer-funded cruisers. Service is often interrupted due to ""police activity"", medical emergencies, breakdowns of equipment (quite common, usually during commute hours), etc. Trains are also very noisy and one can risk to become deaf on the long run. Because of a lack of long-term investments with shortsightedness from staff and administrators, new trains are not expected until 2019 at earliest... New seat designs will be inadequate for future riders so be prepared to walk, ride a bike, drive or move to a better city or region because this system has seen the end of its useful life. As for tracks, who knows? They don' t seem to be quite straight and travel through the transbay tube is ""swingy"" due to currents and tides in the bay. Again, do drive and if you want to save money, may I recommend the Smart? It is very economical and has all the benefits of public transit without the inconveniences.

To avoid especially during the weekends when trains are shorter than usual but packed with weekend tourists and their children, bikes, the airport trains are stuffed with luggage, and service is even more infrequent than during the week. So, do yourself a favor and ride carpool as much as you can. You will save money, time, have a seat and it will smell better.

We came down last weekend and for the first time decided to ride BART. We waited  at Judah and the Ocean station on the Handicapp ramp because I walk with a cane and am disabled. The driver pulled so far away from the ramp that we were all running to catch the train. We got on and then our friend got off and we did not know why. We saw him walking to the front of the train, then back to us but the doors closed and he was left behind. His wife was freaking out because she had all his belongings and he has MS and she was just frantic. We sat there calming her down, trying to figure why he got off the train. She finally saw the very small sign that said that you had to purchase your tickets in the first car. There were no signs at the station or anything telling us to get on the first train. There was nothing written on the outside of the train and the sign in the car that said to go to the first train was the size of the palm of my hand and that is it!. We figured why her husband got off, he was getting tickets because he saw the sign. About that time one of the Security Officers boarded the train. She was about 5""10, African American, and about 165 lbs. She asked if we had our tickets and I personally relayed the whole story to her. She got really rude and had a extremely unprofessional attitude. She asked us all individually what happened and it felt like an interrigation. She made us show her our IDS and said that she would ""Give us the benefit of the doubt"" and ""issue us a citation, this time"" with a warning. She wanted my husband to run train to train at the stops to get to the front of the car and then work his way back to us with the tickets since I am disabled and I could not do it. We were not going to let our only man we had left leave us, so at the next stop we got off the train. When the next train arrived we got in the front of the train and bought tickets and there in the car was my friends husband and the rude, unprofessional, and just plain unfriendly officer. She said ""Well, looks like you found your husband."" And he pulled out all the tickets he had bought for us and showed her. Then she proceeded to check all of our tickets that we just purchased and then two seconds later the other officer checked them again!!!

I used to take bart for couple of jobs in san francisco for a bit.   They're very timely.  On the other hand, unlike CALTRAIN they're filthy.  Atleat caltrain made the right choice of using trash cans and vinyl seats.     I had couple of friends visit from Europe and were really disgusted how bad and smelly it was compared to their public transit rails in europe.  And they being in U.S and specially san francisco couldn't believe how smelly and bad it was.   The worst thing that happens to the BART is by the homeless and pan handlers who don't shower for months and sit on them.  Oh My!  Couple times I remember getting on BART and then sat down and smelled a stench that was horrible. This time,  I could barely breath.  Then I noticed half the car was empty except for one big filty homless lady at the corner of the empty area and some people on the other corner crowded together.  I was in the middle closer to the empty corner and realized the horrendous rotting smell was coming from the filthy homeless lady 10 seats down!!! And forced all the passengers to crowd together for a breath of fresh air.    I tried to act as if I was sick having a cold and can't smell anything to overcome my embarassment of not figurring this out to begin with and move to a corner or the next crowded car!     I think I was successful for about 3 mins or so and felt like throwing up and bolted into the next car and then the one after that.  WHEW!  Now the really funny , sad and disgusting part is that imagine that person who takes that seat when it's empty and thinking , what in the world is that smell.   Now I only ask to take this example and apply it pretty much to most of the seats in BART.   EWWWWWW!!!!!   That was the last time I took BART.   Thankfully as I'm in south bay /peninsula I try to take caltrain if needed.  I never see such packed crowds in caltrain, the have ameneties, you can drink , eat, plug in your laptop and have desks to work.  BART sucks except for the fact they're on time for most part.

At Fruitvale Station two black males entered our car. One was over six feet, muscular, and threatening. This male stood in the middle of the car and in a loud voice announced he needed financial assistance with some kind of payment. He made claims about being a veteran. I'm a veteran I was ashamed. When no one opened their wallets he became menacing and repeated his demand for help. One or two passengers opened their wallets. The other black male was smallish, wore dark sun glasses, and a black hoodie covering his head. He was wearing headphones and walked through the passenger car with a gangsta lope. I felt vulnerable and because I had no weapon - defenseless. If the above two characters were allowed free range then more will follow. BART is on the verge of lawlessness.  Policing needs to be increased! ""ALL LIVES MATTER""",bart

Impossible to figure out how to pay for parking (sign says pay at 'Pay Area' without telling you where it is).  Machines to buy tickets require you to spend 20 minutes figuring out how to buy four tickets to go to Embarcadero (not fun when you've got a line of people behind you).  On the way back, couldn't find the station at Embarcadero till I saw people going down stairs so I gave it a try.  Then stood in line to buy tickets but would take cash or ATM only.  Finally a person told me where to go to use a credit card.  Why no signs to tell me that?  Filthy stations, lack of helpful information to use the system, topped by nasty look from employee when I didn't know what to do with my ticket because the styles were all open.

'get off at your stop, while you can and not have the long journey home.'  but i retorted, 'but i like this, i want to be here alone. why won't you let me? i don't want to go home yet.'  his best argument was sheer silence. i couldn't fight it.  again, i felt defeated.  it was an underground travel now.  i closed my book.  it wasn't my book.  i straightened my neck, put the back of my head against the pole, shut my eyes, and it was more of just me with myself and it was heaven.  i was reflecting on and off of all that was shaded and indistinct.  bart gently forced me off as it came to a slow roll and i stepped onto the platform outside of my flying haven at ""my stop.""  i sighed as i walked toward the stairs gliding up them touching only every third step with one foot.  leaving the station, i scowled at the recorder player and had to face the outside world again with my keys in my hand.",bart

I was given a piece of paper and told to put in a claim. I did. I got a letter from BART telling me to contact the adjuster. When I did called them they had no idea about my case and had, in fact lost my case file. The gentleman said he would call me back. He didn't. I called him and they still hadn't found my file. Then two days later I got a nasty note from BART telling me to get a lawyer. I am so upset I don't know what to do. But I do know that I do not deserve to be treated this way I hope BART reads this.

In any case, I went online to appeal the citation. Don't think they even bothered to check if my claim was legit. They just sent me a letter 8 weeks later saying the claim is denied, the ticket is upheld with no explanation of why it was upheld nor why they ticketed me to begin with. I requested a second appeal which was also denied also with no explanation. I even sent them copies of my parking receipt to no avail. Now to try and resolve this $40 ticket they want me to pay a $20 processing fee and take a day off of work to appear in court. What nonsense. They probably expect people to just give up and they can earn their extra income on a bogus ticket. I'm sure they don't actually bother looking at these claims.

16,4,"Jun 28, 2021","The DC metro is pretty awesome! Having lived in several cities, I find this metro to be easier to navigate, cleaner, cheaper, and more reliable than metros I have taken elsewhere (especially in the northeast)! Sure, maybe not the most luxurious mode of transportation, but we are lucky to have this system in DC which enables us to travel around our city with minimal impact to traffic or pollution.Pros:Cleanliness: The metro is extremely clean, in my opinion. Compared to metros in other major cities that I have taken, each stop is generally taken care of, smells ok, and I never feel disgusted sitting on the metro. You do of course see rats sometimes, but this is pretty much commonplace in every metro system, I believe.Easy to navigate: It is easy to navigate the metro system in DC. The cars will update to tell you which stop is next. Maps are present at each stop, and operating the machines to get a ticket is pretty easy as well. If you are confused or in need of direction, I have found the metro employees to be generally friendly and helpful as well.Price: The price of taking the metro in DC is awesome. You can get a pass for multiple rides which will account to some savings, if you are taking the metro frequently. If not, you can ride most places for about $2 a ride. This definitely beats the price of Uber, Lyft and Taxis if you are willing to walk a little to the stops.Reliability/Speed: I find the metro to be decently reliable. It does occasionally run a couple minutes late, but generally arrives on time, and doesn't encounter too many delays compared to other subway systems I have ridden on.Airport Access: If you need to get from DC to the Airport, let me assure you that taking the metro is the fastest and cheapest way to go (unless you have a lot of bags to carry, I suppose, in which it might be nice to get a ride). The blue line pulls up right next to the airport, though, and makes it a very convenient ride.Crowdedness: The metro doesn't seem to be as crowded as other subways I have taken. I tend to get a bit claustrophobic when I am pushed up too close to someone, but I have always felt very comfortable taking the metro around DC.Cons:I will say that the only con I have sometimes is that I live in Georgetown, and there is no metro stop super close to where I live in particular. Foggy bottom and Dupont Circle metro are within a 15-25 minute walk fro me, but there is nothing super close, which is a little bit of a bummer sometimes!",wmata

The train has broken down before, but I've made it work. The bus hasn't shown up before, but I've made it work. However, today was extremely unacceptable. I know COVID has hit your system extremely hard but there is absolutely no reason your communication and knowledge on a situation is this terrible. My normal stop is at DOCTORS HOSPITAL RDWY & BUS SHELTER which services the G12 or PG16. These buses run every 30 minutes to an hour and if you miss one, you just have to wait for the next. Even before today, this stop has a history of buses that never show up or end up arriving extremely late.This morning, I got there on time praying at least one of them would show up. There was a piece of printer paper taped to the window saying ""until further notice, the bus will not stop here, but at the 7/11."" This hospital is on a hill, but the 7/11 is down the hill and around the corner. I'm looking at the older woman standing next to me with her cane, trying to figure out what to do since we now have to rush to the 7/11. I was able to get her to the professional entrance of the hospital where she was able to call an Uber, because again, we're on a hill! I finally made it to the 7/11 only for the bus to stop nearly 2 blocks BEHIND the store. I'm standing there trying to flag down the driver to at least ask a question and we're throwing hand signals at each other since he can't open the door. I was finally able to understand that he wasn't stopping at the store, but a block and a half past it. The store is at a busy intersection and NOW, I have to run through the light to catch the bus. When I finally got on, I asked if he knew he was supposed to stop at the store and that there was a paper at the stop saying the location had changed...  ""I wouldn't know since I don't go back there."" He wasn't even aware there was a stop change! How could he be?! From the piece of paper that could've blown away at any minute? WMATA, let me tell you something... it doesn't make any sense that I literally had to run a marathon today just to catch the bus.

There are a few cities I've visited where you can walk out of the airport and immediately get on a subway train to downtown - Minneapolis, London, Atlanta, Chicago. And there are several world class cities that do NOT have a subway system hooked right up to their airport - New York and Montreal for instance.It's great because it will get you pretty close to nearly all of the major tourist destinations with a few exceptions. The Lincoln Memorial is probably the furthest.The Metro stations I've experienced have usually been quite clean with very little trash or litter and I don't recall seeing any real graffiti indoors. The trains as well are clean and reasonably comfortable and they're surprisingly quiet (compared to New York and London!). And it's cool that the same trains are used on all lines throughout the system.Strangely, the start of operations on weekends is SEVEN AM. That's just crazy!

Most problems are from the 7000s having manufacturing and design issues, but as of now, they are doing very well, beating out the 6Ks to the top. They will get rid of the 2 and 3Ks, which will probably bring up reliability, though I personally don't like the 7Ks or the 8K render. The 2/3Ks are the best in the system.

I am finishing this review currently sitting on a train at King Street (about 10 minutes now); but they have at least been polite enough today to announce that the delay is currently caused by single-tracking due to maintenance.

65,1,"Feb 15, 2017","I never thought I'd rate the metro, but here I am.Honest to God, this is one of the least efficient, most expensive, and overall worst public transportation systems I have witnessed. Growing up I've had the chance to use the Moscow metro (amazing), Paris (alright), Vienna, Prague, Munich, Berlin, and a few domestically like Chicago, Boston, and New York (amazing). WMATA very unfortunately pales in comparison with all of them. There are some pluses to it, but the negatives outweigh it for the most part.Cons:-Bus schedules are inaccurate and oftentimes late, and sometimes don't even come at all for no announced reason-Long wait times outside of rush hour (and decently long during rush hour occasionally too)-Very expensive fare structure (dependent on whether it is rush hour or not [which are very long periods], and the distance of the trip that you're taking)-Occasionally rude employees (I personally haven't had a problem with this)-Severe lack of competent management-Inefficient ownership/operation structure (different counties in 3 different states each have influence over the system, as well as influence form the federal government)-Boring architecture. Despite what the rest of America thinks, I don't like the brutalist concrete. Makes it look Soviet, which is ironic when you look at how the Moscow metro looks-No reliable access to the main international airport (Dulles). This is unheard of for a major city, and frankly embarrassing-Numerous safety issues (outdated technology, somewhat frequent malfunctions and occasional crashes, other major disruptions like safetrack)-Lack of dedicated funding-Confusing fare passes (28 day metro pass?)-Closing at midnight everyday for the foreseeable futurePros:-SmartTrip card paperless payment system-Somewhat convenient locations-Decent bus routes (D6 particularly great imo)-That's really about it honestlyOverall, despite being the second-busiest public transportation system in the country, WMATA is very poorly equipped to handle such a large flow of people consistently and efficiently. The safety issues are particularly pressing for the time being, but I think that the management and funding issues are overarching and will have to be addressed sooner rather than later so that going forward WMATA can be more beneficial and run smoothly.",wmata

Sometimes buses that aren't full will pass you by for seemingly no reason, which is infuriating. The bus I take to work is so poorly timed. It is supposed to come every 8 minutes. Instead, I see two buses right behind each other pull up almost every morning (of course I'm still two blocks away at this point and can't get there in time to catch it. I swear it's just like that episode of SpongeBob where they left bikini bottom and the bus would sneak past every time they werent looking). This double bus situation means that there won't be another bus for 16-20 minutes. I have sent wmata emails before but of course that was fruitless. I never expected anything else. With Uber and Lyft these days, it's also sometimes easier and cheaper to pool rather than really on this piece of garbage DC calls a Transit system. It's no wonder they are losing money.

The DC metro system has it's ups and downs. And I'm not talking about the huge escalator heights at DuPont Circle or Bethesda. It's nice during rush hour for those of us not going on the most common and sardine'ed routes, and it will pick you up directly from DCA airport which is great. The problem is when it doesn't work, has major delays, and ""routine track work"". If they are going to close the subway of a major metropolitan area in the evenings, at 12am - 5 am Sun-Thursday, I would hope they could use some of this time to fix the issues. A few general statistics-trains are clean-prices are overpriced for public transportation-the trains are packed and run often during rush hour-trains have fairly comfortable seating-pretty good station proximities within dc proper-90% of the time comfortable tempatures-and oh hell, I hate when you miss a 9pm train by 15 seconds and have to wait 20-30 for the next one I'll keep riding, but there is a lot of room for improvement.

No problem with the RIBS bus except for the arrival at the Whiele Metro Station.  Two years after the station opened the RIBS bus stop indicator sign had no knowledge that the Metro Station existed.Tried to use the WMATA trip planner.  Before I left my house it showed that I would have to wait for the train till 2:20.  At the the Whiele Station there was no.informstiom whatsoever about trains departing.  When I tried the internet connection to get the information I got a message that the information was not available.I uploaded $20 to my senior smart card and tried to go through a gate.  No luck, it would not open.  Went to the attendant in the booth who said on a gruff voice: ""Did you try the gate at the end!"".  It would never have occurred to me that I had to use s special gate.  Metro did not hint at any entrance restrictions.The public address system at the station was unintelligible.  Just knew they were having some kind  of a problem somewhereA train arrived at the platform at 1:59 PM started to leave the station, stopped and then backed into the station again.  The delay was about 5 minutes.The car on this new line was archaic.  No signs to indicate stops. The windows were so dirty it was very difficult to read the station names when we stopped.  The loudspeaker system and the train operator who had  no idea of how to talk on a public address system made the announcements  totally incomprehensibleAt the Metro Center station I missed the first Red Line train due to very confusing signs.The Red Line car was modern and had station indicating signs but naturally, they did not work.  At least the speaker system and the announcer were comprehensible.Why does the old part of the system have train departures clearly  and accurately shown while the brand new spanking Whiele Ststion doesn't?I pay the tolls to support Metro.  After this trip I will stop using 267.  I see my money is being wasted.I don't think money is the whole problem  I think it's the work culture of the management and employees that has created the current condition.We have the worst  Metro system I have ever used.

My card, which had approximately $40 on it, mysteriously has a zero balance. After some research, this is apparently the result of WMATA ""archiving"" balances. The trend I saw in the reports is that you have to put more money on the card to ""retrieve"" your archived balance. This equates to both a ransom and fraud. I've scoured your T&Cs for the SmarTrip card and this is not mentioned. Second, the ""station manager"" was of absolutely zero help to me.  The ""manager"" in question was C Jackson of the Suitland station.  When I went to her for help, she was ""busy"" wiping off her desk.  She made zero eye contact and responded to me without even turning on her microphone so I could hear her.  Eventually, and fed up with the extreme disrespect, went back to attempt to just purchase another card since C Jackson was reluctant to do her job.  I'm sure this will not be a surprise to you...it wasn't to me -- BOTH farecard machines were out of order. When I went back to C Jackson, she didn't even bother to look up or respond to my plea for assistance. I left the station and headed to CVS to purchase a new card. There I was greeted warmly, assisted by the operations manager, purchased a new card and was in/out in less than 5 minutes total, including time spent in line. THAT is the type of person you need to hire as a station manager!To make matters worse, when I returned to the station to continue my trip, now late, I spotted two African American women having the exact issue I experienced.  I only mention race and gender for one reason...C Jackson saw, from her little booth, that they were experiencing issues and she promptly exited her booth and approached in an incredibly friendly tone and manner to assist. Here is my query:  Why did I not get the same respect and service?  Is it because I am a man?  Is it because I am white?  Is it because C Jackson is the wrong person for the station manager role?  My best guess is that it is a disgraceful combination of all of these reasons.This, WMATA, is yet another reason your ridership has declined. I've lived in the DC area all my life and have been a patron for many years. The service, both personal and mechanical, has severely declined over the last 10 years. I would also be curious to find out exactly where the monies that I am sure were budget line items every year for maintenance went?  It clearly did not go for maintenance, or the system would not be in this current situation causing a loss of more ridership.  I now have a new SmarTrip card, but have not recovered the existing monies WMATA has stolen from me...and there are countless others in the same boat.#UnsuckMetro",wmata

All of those places have a transit system that makes the WMATA look quite incompetent. While there is nothing wrong with the cleanliness of the stations. Often stations sometimes aren't properly lit or trains don't come as often as they should in a populous metro area.   The buses are often late, often drivers stop without any explanation  and switch off which takes ten minutes of just sitting in a bus at a stop.   Soo  while WMATA isn't the best, it could be better, we can all atleast agree that this is not the MARTA in Atlanta.",wmata

I filled out the Lost & Found form on the website.  After a few days I didn't hear anything.  I figured it was gone.  After 8 day's I received an email informing me my item was at the Lost & Found office.  I'm not sure of the whole story.  However, I would like to Thank WMATA.  The great people working at this organization made a rider a staunch advocate of the system going forward.   I would also like to include kudos to the Metro Police officers who have gone above and beyond in investigating a mysterious person harassing a female person in my family  during her morning commute.  This harassment happened a few times by the same individual.  I advised her to bring it to the attention of an officer located at the station.  This particular officer assured her that he would show up each day at the specific time she gets on the train to watch.  I am not sure of the result but I do know she did not get harassed anymore.",wmata

109,2,"Aug 7, 2014","The continued degradation of the blue line over the past three years has been appalling. First came the switch from a one to one blue to orange train rotation to a 2 - 3 orange for every blue rotation.  Not only did this add at least 5 - 10 min each trip plus a fare hike, but the 2nd, and more so the 3rd, orange line trains are practically empty as everyone crowds into the first. Then came the yellow line ""rush plus."" Downed trains, track rotation problems and properly identifying each train as either blue or yellow has continued to plague wmata and they hit us with another fare hike and added an additional couple of minutes each way for each trip. Now we have the silver line, which arrived with a fare increase and an additional 10 - 20 minutes for each trip. For example, two evenings ago during rush hour, I waited 10 minutes for a blue at the Metro Center while 3 oranges and 2 silvers passed.  This morning during rush hour waiting at King String noted a 20 minute wait for a blue line. The only reason this is not a one star is that at least the trains are pretty much clean and rarely are without A/C or heating.  No clue why the blue line has been so abandoned with no other commuter solutions offered, especially for tourists (Arlington Cemetery) and travelers (Reagan National).

112,2,"Jan 19, 2016","I find it odd that a city that built a public rail still finds more ways to muck it up. I fail to believe that DC cannot come up with a system when every major city in Europe and in Japan operate more reliably and more consistently on a schedule, that it shames DC Metro by comparison. Even in the newer stations, WMATA fails to make the third rail, to bypass any trains that have broken down. The newer trains are nice, but far fewer than the trains that one consistently prays will hold together.This is strictly perpetual poor management. Even in the changes in the leadership, who promise communication, we get met with unannounced delays on the Blue lines, which leads to overcrowding on the Blue lines (moreso than usual). And the bus routes are best to plan with dice, than follow any sort of schedule printed on the kiosks. I've found even the Next Bus app to be wrong in when buses are to arrive, how far they are away, ect. To be frank, WMATA needs an almost complete overhaul.The daily workers on the ground, the labor force, are the only reason for the 2 stars, as they have to deal with the unrelenting complaints by the riders who have no alternative (due to parking being too high of a cost in DC), and being blamed for poor equipment and poor management. They do their best, but the suits up top? There is a rotten state in this WMATA, to match the smell of those brake fluid leaks in stations.",wmata
113,1,"May 1, 2014","Using the metro is not unlike owning and caring for a gremlin, the eponymous creatures from the 1984 classic, ""Gremlins"". Beneath its aesthetically pleasing exterior (due to the system's relative cleanliness over other mass transit systems) lie a set of inconveniences that are frustrating at best and truly capture the film's comedy and horror at its worst.1) NEVER EXPOSE TO SUNLIGHT: In the film's climax, Gizmo, Billy's original mogwai, is able to eliminate the renegade gremlins by opening a set of blinds and exposing them to sunlight. It seems Metro trains have the same allergy to sunlight, as you'll frequently be trapped underground in an effort to hide from the sun's harsh UV rays. I have been trapped in the cavernous tunnels of the rail system so many times, that I've often wondered if I'll ever see sunlight again. As my daily commute keeps me within D.C. city limits, and I unable to confirm what happens at Metro's numerous outdoor stations outside of the city, but I can only assume that trains instantaneously combust when approaching stations such as Arlington Cemetery. 2) NEVER GET IT WET: When it rains in our nation's capital, as it has the majority of this past week, service grinds to a halt, resulting in 15 minute delays during rush hour and single-tracking due to train/rail malfunctions. Unlike gremlins, however, trains do not multiply when exposed to moisture, a defect that would actually improve service. It's unclear why God would design a creature that has such negative side-effects when exposed to water, one of the building blocks of life, but it is equally appalling that someone would design a system that is unable to account for rail problems, lacks an express service, and has stations that are so horribly designed, that you wonder if the designer has a grudge against humanity, similar to Stripe, the main villain of ""Gremlins"".3) NEVER FEED IT AFTER MIDNIGHT: To be fair, WMATA does a good job in discouraging riders from breaking this rule. As service at most stations terminate at midnight during the work week, there is not much opportunity to feed the beast that is WMATA your money, though service is extended on weekends. Luckily, the infrequent trains and unreliability of service often deters would-be riders from using the Metro late at night on the weekends. Smarter commuters opt for better options such as Uber  and other taxi services, while only the bravest (read: drunkest) travelers dare to tempt fate by breaking this cardinal rule.While I enjoy the whimsy of ""Gremlins"" as a motion picture, the real world manifestation of gremlins (that is, WMATA) does not capture the film's action and humor, instead replacing those qualities with crippling despair. LIke caring for your own mogwai, riding the Metro means you are subjecting yourself to a world of inconveniences that is both expensive and burdensome. Do not be persuaded by other yelp reviews that champion individual standout performances of lone WMATA employees or praise WMATA""s ease for tourists; those people just haven't seen ""Gremlins"".",wmata

In a government centered city we should have access to a tranist system that isnt run by the private sector. Its dangerous, hostile and very expensive. Its at capacity, needs allot of renovation and updating. Its not normal to feel like the system you use to get to work isnt safe and is this costly.

119,2,"May 1, 2014","I left a detailed review for the DC metro (rail) on the ""metrorail"" yelp page. So this is just a short review for the metrobus:I guess to me, distances I consider short are long to others because I walk a lot. I mean, I always wonder why there are so many stops in DC for the metrobus but I guess people in the states do not like to walk. But when I go on the 30 buses or N bus, E buses or some of the L buses, they have stops every 1-2 blocks and I always wonder why that can't be at least every 3-4 blocks or more. But sometimes I go to a stop and, even with my fairly poor vision, I can look down the street and see the next stop. Has metro ever thought of increasing the distance between each stop?  Because with some of these buses, it takes forever and a day to get to your destination. I figure you are stopping, on average, every half block almost. Either because of a red light, or a bus stop or to swerve around a police car or delivery truck. To me it is wildly inefficient. Plus, if you are at a terminus waiting for a bus to come out, sometimes they not leave in time.  Sometimes because a driver is fooling around but I guess there are other reasons too.  Not consistent enough departures to depend upon as this type of stuff can make you late.I would only depend on metrobus if you don't need to be anywhere ASAP, there is decent service (leaves every 20 minutes), you have a nextbus app and you are leaving from somewhere that is not close to a metro and is going somewhere that is also not close to a metro and the route is at least somewhat direct.  Otherwise, you are better off taking metro rail.  Drivers are hit or miss but some of them can be rude:  They rush people on and off just because they are running late on their route (why did you dick around so much before departing?), they DO NOT know their route well enough sometimes to give you proper advice on your desired destination, etc.  Other times, I have come across some lovely drivers.  I get the repetitive nature of the job must be awful, but try to look on the bright side, you are earning 65K/year to just drive..",wmata

I have not taken a bus since 1996! Mr . Caster not only greeted me courteously and reassured me to get safely to my destination. Mr. Caster acknowledged each and every bus rider. Answered numerous questions while boarding and alerted all passengers how many minutes to departure time. Once Mr. Caster began his route, he treated each passenger with respect and care as he would find the safest area for each passenger to get off the bus. He would lower the bus and said goodbye to each passenger. One passenger for instance mentioned to him that she was going to Plaza del Mercado, Mr. Caster suggested to her a different stop where would be safer for her to walk. The area had been covered with at least 10 inches of snow and many sidewalks were covered. People walked along the main road and Mr. Caster would bring each passenger to the safest area each time. I was impressed by his dedication and care as he went above and beyond his duties. The passenger who was going to Plaza del Mercado got off safely and he even said to her to be careful and to watch for vehicles. That passenger seemed she had a disability and Mr. Caster treated her as he did each and every passenger, male and female, always looking out for their safety. I asked Mr. Caster for his name, his humility was such that he said it was not necessary for me to write a note that mentioning to him was enough. Mr. Caster made me feel safe, dropped me off at a safe location and conducted many acts of kindness throughout his route. I hope this note reaches Mr. Caster, he is an asset to our transportation system in Montgomery County.My kindest regards",wmata

122,1,"Jun 26, 2019","I haven't used the bus system, but as far as the train goes, I would avoid at all costs. There are no positives I can think of. During rush hour, trains should come every 3-5 minutes to accommodate the number of people riding at that time, especially in the middle of the city. Instead, the greenline trains that goes straight up through the city come every 7-9 minutes during rush hour. Twice in the last month I, along with a lot of other people, couldn't get on the train because it was so full, and the next one wasn't going to get there for another 8 minutes. You don't have that problem during the off hours, but just be prepared to stand on the platform for a while because the trains only come every 15-20 minutes. This is all assuming there aren't any delays due the track work that is somehow ALWAYS happening. I think $2 is expensive for the poor service you get, and that's the cheapest your ride will be. It could get up to almost $3 for one ride. Not very clean. Platforms are dark and dingy with mice scurrying around. Overall just not a good experience.",wmata
123,2,"Jul 3, 2012","Metro Train 1 star.  Metro Bus 3 StarNative Washingtonians who have never left the area are often not aware that the best trains have 2 routes - a local and express.  You get every route on WMATA trains as local.  This mean even if a person is going to the other end of the line, that person must endure every stop along the line! I must state some good things before I get into why I've observed why the Metro trains are so bad.The trains are clean.  No one is allowed to eat or drink (unless during a heatwave and restrictions are lifted for a bottle of water) on the train.  The escalators are under constant repair.  So riders don't see an abundance of rats on the tracks.My issue with the WMATA trains is the three C's:1. Cost2. Lack of Convenience3. Lack of CharacterWMATA trains charge for  both distance traveled AND time of day one travels.Riding from the start of the line to the end is expensive.  In addition, the service for riding weekdays during the rush hour is called the peak of the peak and extra charge is placed on that too.  Paying $12 one way is normal for DC.  Also, keep in mind that Federal Government workers have Metro Checks which pay for their rides.  The people who can most afford Metro get free rides into work while others must pick up the exorbitant costs.Secondly, lack of convenience is because the buses that did route from the county directly into the city were altered to go to the more costly Metro stations.  Taking the buses used to be cheaper and a bit less time consuming.  Now most bus routes in the county lead toward the Metro stations.  Riding one bus to the next with the transfer cuts costs for the rider.  I suggest checking the WMATA site for possible bus routes.  During the heatwave, in a CODE RED Metro buses are FREE to ride and are air conditioned.Also, I had a meeting in DC when I rushed like Cinderella to catch the train directly across the street at 11:50PM only to find that the last train going to my station left on a Thursday night.  I'd have to take 3 WMATA buses to get back to my car which was parked at a Metro lot!  These buses would take about 3 hours to get me there around 3-3:30AM!!!  DC Metro shuts down at midnight during the week!  This accounts for the lack of quality nightlife in the city.  Other places rely on convenience of public transportation to get riders in and out of town safely.  DC is two-faced in that they want you to visit, but leave when the 11:00 news comes on television.Riding the Metro trains, the stations have little character.  Sure no one is allowed to panhandle which is great, but no one is allowed to entertain at all.  Outside some stations, musicians recently have been allowed to entertain.  However once on the trains, the atmosphere is super conservative and lacks any energy.    Sure I want to get from point A to B at a reasonable cost in a reasonable amount of time, but having something fun around helps me forget that I just paid $5 to get from Union Station to the County and had local stops along the way!  Make sure that if you catch a bus from the train to get a transfer slip when getting onto the WMATA train.  No one will tell you this.",wmata
