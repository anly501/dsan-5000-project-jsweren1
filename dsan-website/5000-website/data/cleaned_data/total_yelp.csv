2,5,"Jul 26, 2023","I had to compliment WMATA on the shuttle service from College Park to Ft.Totten. I have been greeted with so many warm smiles and friendly directions and guidance to the shuttles!!!! Ty All! Hey, and honorable mention on the increase in security on and around the trains!!! In the past I have been harassed on 3 different occasions, and was seriously thinking of driving to work. As of recently, I'm quite comfortable knowing security is visible and obtainable quickly. Keep up the improvements and great work!!! Thank you!"
3,1,"Oct 27, 2023",Since when did metro close the doors to their under serviced lines before the group of people WAITING to get in could even get in. That is unimaginably frustrating. Blue line to Franconia Metro center at 2:56 pm today.
4,1,"Sep 29, 2023","So many things wrong with wmata I can't even begin to list them all.  For one, this morning toda a train derailed.  Maintenance seems to be the #1 issue, followed by people jumping fare gates. It wouldn't seem so bad if it happens once in a while, but to see it happening every since time I go through fare gates as I'm coming and going is a little much by people who don't care who else they affect"
5,5,"Sep 23, 2023","I WFH, and WMATA has been very helpful in my mobile access to things I need in the city (5 stars)."
6,4,"Sep 18, 2022",I took the metro while visiting DC. I began at Federal Center to the Pentagon. Then Pentagon to McPhearsonThe McPherson to the Smithsotian and back to Federal Center. I am concerned to take the metro since I am a turist but the metro was somewhat clean. I downloaded the metro app and it was very helpful. Very easy to travel to all areas I needed to go. I will highly recommend the use of the metro when traveling and visiting DC.My full day pass cost $12.00
7,1,"Sep 11, 2023","Less than zero. Some bureaucrat decided to replace all the metro maps on the platforms with advertising monitors that only show a metro map once every 20 ads or five minutes so forget about using one to figure out your route. It's the ultimate insult to customers. It says ""we literally DO NOT CARE if you get where you're going so long as our advertisements generate revenue."
8,3,"Jul 27, 2022",The Georgia Avenue Limited Line is the Bus 79 Metro Express between Chinatown and Silver Spring.The limited number of stops has advantages to theBus 70 on the same route. The idea and effort is tobe commended. There is a definite need to easilyconnect these two areas overlooked by Metro routes. The fares are currently the WMATA regular bus fare.Time saved is probably not worth a premium bus fare.
9,3,"Jun 22, 2022","Senior SmarTrip card costs $2 and provides $1 Metrobus and 1/2 off peak Metro fares.Other suburban bus fares are also discounted. Retirees have the advantage of flexible schedules.Unfortunately, school and work years were less enjoyable."
10,3,"Jul 11, 2021","Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.Being a native Washingtonian, public transportationis dear to my heart. My first date was via Metrobus.As a high school student, it was my only method of transportation.As a college student, frustration dominated my experiences.As a parent and adult, my coworkers and family are appalledby my transportation choices. Kudos for addition of DC Circulator.Now as a senior citizen, this is my preferred way of getting around DMV.Still gritty and grimy, yet useful and underappreciated.If you want to go fast, go alone.If you want to go far, go together."
11,1,"Aug 20, 2023",The man who works at the Judiciary Square stop should be fired or get some customer service training. So rude. Unnecessarily mean. Get some customer service training.
12,1,"Aug 18, 2023","You have a lower approval rating than Trump in the deep blue city of Trump. That is saying something. But well deserved. Let's see. First you built stations a mile deep. Then you realized open air might be better. Except when the whether is bad. Nevermind, it was the wave of the future. Then you figured the trains could drive themselves. Until the other part of the system malfunctioned and 18ish people died. Then you figured high tech trains would solve. Until your crappy tracks broke them. In between, you retired the old metro cards until you retired the new metro cards. Then the wave of the future hit. A million layers of security to transfer a metro card with $5 dollars on it to the lap. Including having the actual metro cards because that is"
13,2,"Aug 13, 2023",Why is it that wmata's mobile and card management so dysfunctional? What is the obsession over having a physical card if you use mobile app? Changing phones requires using original smart card to install in new phone wallet. Why can't wmata implement a more simple approach like the NYC subway has?
16,4,"Jun 28, 2021","The DC metro is pretty awesome! Having lived in several cities, I find this metro to be easier to navigate, cleaner, cheaper, and more reliable than metros I have taken elsewhere (especially in the northeast)! Sure, maybe not the most luxurious mode of transportation, but we are lucky to have this system in DC which enables us to travel around our city with minimal impact to traffic or pollution.Pros:Cleanliness: The metro is extremely clean, in my opinion. Compared to metros in other major cities that I have taken, each stop is generally taken care of, smells ok, and I never feel disgusted sitting on the metro. You do of course see rats sometimes, but this is pretty much commonplace in every metro system, I believe.Easy to navigate: It is easy to navigate the metro system in DC. The cars will update to tell you which stop is next. Maps are present at each stop, and operating the machines to get a ticket is pretty easy as well. If you are confused or in need of direction, I have found the metro employees to be generally friendly and helpful as well.Price: The price of taking the metro in DC is awesome. You can get a pass for multiple rides which will account to some savings, if you are taking the metro frequently. If not, you can ride most places for about $2 a ride. This definitely beats the price of Uber, Lyft and Taxis if you are willing to walk a little to the stops.Reliability/Speed: I find the metro to be decently reliable. It does occasionally run a couple minutes late, but generally arrives on time, and doesn't encounter too many delays compared to other subway systems I have ridden on.Airport Access: If you need to get from DC to the Airport, let me assure you that taking the metro is the fastest and cheapest way to go (unless you have a lot of bags to carry, I suppose, in which it might be nice to get a ride). The blue line pulls up right next to the airport, though, and makes it a very convenient ride.Crowdedness: The metro doesn't seem to be as crowded as other subways I have taken. I tend to get a bit claustrophobic when I am pushed up too close to someone, but I have always felt very comfortable taking the metro around DC.Cons:I will say that the only con I have sometimes is that I live in Georgetown, and there is no metro stop super close to where I live in particular. Foggy bottom and Dupont Circle metro are within a 15-25 minute walk fro me, but there is nothing super close, which is a little bit of a bummer sometimes!"
17,1,"Jul 19, 2022","Explain to me how the bus spontaneously comes 5 minutes earlier than the scheduled time just because... or how the bus just never shows up, even though it says arriving and departing on the map while you're literally standing there at the stop... or how your only form of communication about a new stop location is in bold typing on a piece of computer paper taped to a window. The train and the bus have been late many times before, but I've made it work. The train has broken down before, but I've made it work. The bus hasn't shown up before, but I've made it work. However, today was extremely unacceptable. I know COVID has hit your system extremely hard but there is absolutely no reason your communication and knowledge on a situation is this terrible. My normal stop is at DOCTORS HOSPITAL RDWY & BUS SHELTER which services the G12 or PG16. These buses run every 30 minutes to an hour and if you miss one, you just have to wait for the next. Even before today, this stop has a history of buses that never show up or end up arriving extremely late.This morning, I got there on time praying at least one of them would show up. There was a piece of printer paper taped to the window saying ""until further notice, the bus will not stop here, but at the 7/11."" This hospital is on a hill, but the 7/11 is down the hill and around the corner. I'm looking at the older woman standing next to me with her cane, trying to figure out what to do since we now have to rush to the 7/11. I was able to get her to the professional entrance of the hospital where she was able to call an Uber, because again, we're on a hill! I finally made it to the 7/11 only for the bus to stop nearly 2 blocks BEHIND the store. I'm standing there trying to flag down the driver to at least ask a question and we're throwing hand signals at each other since he can't open the door. I was finally able to understand that he wasn't stopping at the store, but a block and a half past it. The store is at a busy intersection and NOW, I have to run through the light to catch the bus. When I finally got on, I asked if he knew he was supposed to stop at the store and that there was a paper at the stop saying the location had changed...  ""I wouldn't know since I don't go back there."" He wasn't even aware there was a stop change! How could he be?! From the piece of paper that could've blown away at any minute? WMATA, let me tell you something... it doesn't make any sense that I literally had to run a marathon today just to catch the bus. I didn't even know who to be upset with this morning."
18,1,"Dec 27, 2022","****WATCH OUT FOR STATION MANAGER C.SMITH UNRULY BEHAVIOR****Date:12/27/22Train: Silver LineApproximate time of incident: 9:06amLocation: Greensboro StationStation manager name: C. SmithAs I was exiting the Silver line train at the Greensboro Station, I went to the bathroom and it was locked. I go and ask the station manager C.Smith if he can please open the door? and he had a very disgraceful and unprofessional, unruly attitude as if he was having a terrible morning already and said the bathroom is already opened. I said it's not, he said ""yes it is and yelled at me and walked away. I tap the window to get his attention since he walked away to advise, if he can open up the bathroom one more time and he got mad and said ""Now the bathroom is close have a good day"". Unbelievable,  I was refused to use a public bathroom. I am a Metrorail paying customer. This was uncalled and unfair that a WMATA station manager refuse a customer to use WMATA restroom because of his personal feelings.""UNBELIEVABLE""According to the WMATA guidelines it stipulates:WMATA advises patrons-in-need to obtain permission from individual Station Managers. WMATA expects that in almost all cases the station manager will honor a customers request to use the facilities."
19,3,"Apr 22, 2021","4/22/21Whether I was taking the Q2 to Weaton, Montgomery College, Lake Forest Mall,  Weaton Mall or Silver Spring, Metro Transit is what I used to get from A to Q.  Most of the time I had pleasant experiences on the bus.  Most of the time the buses were pretty clean, but there were times the buses were not or them smelled bad.   This was mostly do bad hygiene or  people sweating, because of the heat.I have seen arguments on the bus; as well as physical altercations, but they never got fully out of control.   I did enjoy watching these events transpire.  The Metro/Subway:In the beginning taking the metro was pleasant. I enjoyed reading my books for a 45 minute ride. I enjoyed experiencing the No Pants Day during the Winter Season. I enjoyed riding the subway during Halloween and seeing people dressed up. I will never forget seeing a woman dressed up like Olive Oyl getting into a argument with her boyfriend dressed up as Popeye.I will never forget the homeless man stinking up the whole subway car. The smell hit everyone's nose like a ton of bricks..The only thing worse than the homeless man were the delays on the train. Several times it caused me to be late for work and nearly fired.  The other problem I have experienced are the horrible personalities of some station managers. I have asked a legitimate question and got 15 second pause before he answer in a not so nice tone.  WTF!? Hopeful hiring people with better manners is something that is being done.The Subway had a lot of problems going on, but I hope they have been able to turn this problem around. I haven't been on the subway or bus transit system for a while. I am curious to see what has changed in the years I have been away from them. I hope they are better now."
20,1,"Jan 18, 2022","I moved away and submitted a card for refund, exactly as directed by WMATA when I called them originally in Oct.. Now they refuse to refund the $28.30 that was left on the card, even though they readily admit that I returned the card and all records show that amount remains on the card. They pass you from person to person, no one knows the other... they all have a different story and none make sense. They just wear you down and keep your money. I believe someone is skimming and no one wants to admit it.    Best advice...do NOT give them credit card number to ""auto load"". Instead, add to your card with cash or CC on your own so they cannot ""auto load"", charge your CC, then refuse to refund unused amount."
21,1,"Oct 22, 2022","WMATA Metro is legit trash they operate as if DC is a third world city. Very unreliable especially after Covid pandemic. Maybe because more people in DC drive compared to New York, they don't bother fixing the issues,"
22,2,"Sep 7, 2021","I was offered a small $8 partial refund on my wasted DASH pass.  $8 dollars... That doesn't make up for the $40 in fares I paid while waiting for my pass to finally activate.... I told them to keep the $8. DASH busses are now FARE FREE and no longer even have a DASH pass as of 9/5/21. Thank you to DASH for stepping up and going fare free.... I wish all regional buses would jump on the same bandwagon. as for WMATA, 2 stars now because I was offered some assistance... but at the end of the day, I will stick with not loading any kind of passes to my card and just pay cash at the fare box to add money to my card, seems any other option for adding money to a card takes hours or even days.... they need to step up their game when it comes to the online purchase of adding to a card."
23,1,"Sep 3, 2021","bought dash pass 8/3, wasn't loaded until 8/16, when it did finally load it listed on the website as being loaded on 8/1 so my 1 month dash pass only lasted from 8/16 to 9/1 and then it expired... what a rip off. Ill just continue to pay for full price rides, I lost probably $40 on the whole deal of buying a 30 day dash pass that only worked for 15 of those days. Total waste of money."
24,1,"Aug 11, 2021","horrible.... bought a dash pass as I take dash bus 2 times daily... $45 for the dash pass on 8/3  as of 8/11 dash pass still not loaded to my card... called customer service and was advised they would ""refresh the card"" I use my card EVERY day... I loaded my dash pass on 8/3.... it's 8/11 and I am still paying $2 bucks a clip for a ride when it should be covered under my pass that I paid $45 for 2 weeks ago... I will NEVER buy a pass again... they have gotten at least $40 out of me for bus rides that should have been covered under a pass I bought a week and a half ago... F*ck WMATA..."
25,2,"Apr 8, 2017","After relying on metro rail and buses for a solid two years, I just one of the worst disappointments today. The 16B bus never showed up, and I gave up after about 40 minutes. To think that there must be others like me who ride the bus to work and some person/people's doing/not doing their job affects our ability to get to our workplaces on time outrages me at least a little bit.What is with the live schedule data, by the way? There's ""old data,"" ""scheduled data"" and unspecified data, and in today's case, none of them reflected the actual running of the bus service. Let me also mention how reliably late at least the 16B route buses are, and that I honesty cannot count the times I have been forced to be late for work because of this unreliability. On a positive note, I appreciate that there is a public transit system at all, especially for those who do not have a private means of transit."
26,4,"Jun 26, 2016","As a relatively new resident of the DC/Virginia, I want to focus on what works for me and the benefits of the Metro service for my current needs. I think WMATA provides a decent system of public transport trough rail and bus service. Sure, the expected ""major"" service disruptions due to SafeTrack add a little anxiety because I regularly rely on the Metro for commute, and I've heard that this major repair work is a result of years -some say decades- of neglect and mismanagement. Maybe the disruptions will be so great that I might feel differently about WMATA weeks and months down the track, but for now and so far, it has been pretty great and reliable. And it looks heaps better than the NYC subway! There have been several occasions where I felt like making a formal complaint but decided not to, including one time at Rosslyn station the blue line trainer people out but shut the doors so quickly after people got odd that dozens of people including me didn't get a chance to board the train. I hope they keep improving and complete the system upgrade successfully."
27,1,"Nov 27, 2018","Constant delays, several hold ups, many out of order, always late, oh yes and smells bad"
28,3,"Aug 2, 2017","WMATA is definitely the most expensive mass transit system in the United States to use. With the price based on your starting and ending points, I'm still wondering why they are short on revenue, but being short on revenue is the story of most mass transit systems. Almost half  of the system is underground. I didn't experience any of my trains being delayed (which I know was a major complaint among the locals). However, I did experience escalators being out of service and being serviced at every station.  Rush hour was a breeze, no issues as far as missing connected trains.  The stations could use more lighting on the platforms  ."
31,1,"Sep 10, 2018",WORST. METRO. SYSTEM. ANYWHERE!!It's not just the incessant stopping and starting over and over... IT MAKES NO SENSE! HOW do you stop 3ft short of the mark in a station repeatedly?!? OrWHY would you need to stop 1 train length into a tunnel for 6 stations in a row?!?ITS THE 21st CENTURY!!! Get with the program.The service is a national embarrassment!
32,1,"Nov 6, 2017","One star now... I don't know whose bright idea was it to single track on the weekends on the red line. Here I am at Grosvenor and I find out that trains are running 30 minutes behind... so my day is already ruined thinking I'm be on time to an event, i had to wait for the old train to go to the slim shady station and come back here... friends asking me where am I! So almost 45 minutes later the train arrives... then a few stops later a lady enters with her flea infested canine. It was in a dirty knap sack with no vest. Obviously not a service animal. Then a young cat decided to sit next to me smelling like a brewery and decides to eat his cheetos and ice tea and leave his trash on the seat when his stop came. This scenario is all to common on metro. At Chinatown metro you see all types of mice and large rats running through the platforms. Don't take the Green line going into D.C. At night either.  Escalators and elevators are always out of service!"
33,2,"May 16, 2016","The worst mass transit system in the country! Yes I said country! NYC is better and it's much older! It's very unreliable and unpredictable! The trains are now single tracking which causes major delays especially now. General manager hasn't done much through the years and now all of the sudden is making drastic changes. At times when I'm on the green line or red train stops in the tunnels for long periods of time without notice. Fares always increase yet service continues to deteriorate. Kids on the trains run the show during  PM rush hour. As of June 3rd the subway closes at midnight, so they can supposedly fix the issues. Something they should have done from the beginning. Not good for club goers or club promoters. Be on guard when on the train especially on the green line, leave early and plan ahead because there will always be delays. Worst lines are red and green line. Avoid metro center stop. No air. Very few train cabins during rush hour."
34,1,"Jan 4, 2022","Peaceful peaceful rising. I boarded the train to work on 1/4/22 @ Congress Hts Metro toward Greenbelt.  Much to my dismay the train conductor announces the train will be dumped at Navy yard and a shuttle bus will be waiting I hadn't been on the train 10mins before our peace was penetrated. The passengers get out the station NO BUS ANYWHERE TO BE SEEN. People are scrambling to access Uber, Lyft reception was bad so the buffering continued in addition to no cars being available. One of metro constituents announces SHUTTLE BUS WILL BE ARRIVING! In ten minutes or!! NO BUS EVER CAME unless it came after I access my Lyft. It was well over an hour of waiting. Chicago has a system that runs above ground and it's robust in sound never have you heard of the mis fractions that continue to occur on this system. NY has a very very extensive system you never hear of derailments NOTHING compared to what I've experienced upon my arrival to DC. Clearly the ball is being dropped in reference to improving the mis fractions that continues to occur. I pray Sincerely that WMATA will rectify all that continues occur. Has  the loss of life meant anything?? There is 361 days to better accommodate those of us who use this type of transportation for getting to our bread and butter. Appreciate any kind of taking ownership of today's turn of events before 7am this morning. Appreciate you B...."
35,5,"Oct 30, 2018",I'm much appreciative of the WMATA employees for assisting me with obtaining an item I dropped on the train tracks. They were very helpful.
36,1,"Dec 5, 2019","This review is directed to the customer relations department, which most likely does not exist!?! All Metro bus drivers need to take a course on customer service, 98% of the bus drivers are extremely rude non responsive to questions concerns for the comfort of their passengers. And especially to our  vacationers that come to visit this beautiful, rich in culture and history historical Tri-State of our nation's Capital...Now for reading maps and Street pole postings of bus stop, this needs a revamp aswell.  the majority of bus stop poles that indicate the bus number need to also indicate the direction in which one is traveling when you get to the bus stop. one is not sure if it's across the street or in the same direction to continue traveling to the Final Destination. most bus drivers when you ask them of a specific stop on their route they don't know, in most cases they just go by landmarks and  in extreme cases they're very rude and ask you if you know how to read . They say to read the labeled at the front of the bus or they'll just look you up and down and wont say a word to you.Just a little frustrated. I'm rambling but nonetheless it's a huge concern for those of us that commute with wmata please be more compassionate and informative to our traveling needs... thank you I hope improvements of customer service come soon..."

38,1,"Aug 20, 2019","I was taking the 25B (2962) via vadorn. The driver was standing outside talking in her phone. The bus displayed no sign of the line. When I was trying to ask her about the bus number.. she keeps ignoring me and talking in the phone. More people start coming and waiting while the driver keeps ignoring everybody. When I asked her for the second time, she turned to me and said "" don't you see that I am in the phone"" then she went back again..."
39,1,"Jan 5, 2017",Tourists should beware of the metro.You sometimes wait over 10 minutes for a train.Sometimes your train stalls and makes you over 30 minutes late.The speaker system is tinny and loud and the Metro employees natter on incessantly about their collapsing system and which piece is down that day.If you need an escalator or elevator for luggage or a bike chances are it will broken down at one end of your trip.If you have to go very far or can't always wait until after rush hour it is going to be $4 each way.  Not sustainable if you are planning to use it 5 days a week to go to work.  Sharing an Uber may be cheaper.The system is often dirty so careful what you touch.Violent teenagers and raving racists and lunatics are not uncommon.
40,1,"Oct 5, 2019","Yellow line train suddenly changed to a Blue line train when it wasn't even on a Blue line station ( Archives station) makes no sense, and they didn't give folks a chance to get off."
41,1,"Aug 17, 2016","Zero stars. ZEROThis system is lunacy.Buy a car.If you need to feel environmentally considerate, buy a prius."
44,3,"Feb 21, 2014","Don't get me wrong - I love the DC Metro system. It goes to lots of places (and misses tons of places, too). It's cheap enough with a $14 day pass. There are a few cities I've visited where you can walk out of the airport and immediately get on a subway train to downtown - Minneapolis, London, Atlanta, Chicago. And there are several world class cities that do NOT have a subway system hooked right up to their airport - New York and Montreal for instance.It's great because it will get you pretty close to nearly all of the major tourist destinations with a few exceptions. The Lincoln Memorial is probably the furthest.The Metro stations I've experienced have usually been quite clean with very little trash or litter and I don't recall seeing any real graffiti indoors. The trains as well are clean and reasonably comfortable and they're surprisingly quiet (compared to New York and London!). And it's cool that the same trains are used on all lines throughout the system.Strangely, the start of operations on weekends is SEVEN AM. That's just crazy! And really irritating for someone who had an 8AM departure out of DCA. Ugh."
45,1,"Dec 22, 2016","Not sure if WMATA would be supportive of customers attending  the inauguration. Perhaps WMATA needs assistance also on how to plan, organize ,  and expedite production of  user friendly cards?"
46,1,"Apr 21, 2018","Worst service I've ever encountered in my whole entire life please use Uber, Lyft, or via when in dc this service is soul crushingly inadequate"
47,1,"Dec 21, 2015","Two stars...that's just too generous!!!! It looks like I have to rate metro at least one star to write a review and that's just wrong! Metro is more of a negative rating experience and has been for a long time with no improvement in sight! Why I continue to to use it shows the general problem...no options.  Guaranteed money leaves them without any motivation to change.Today's particular issue...signals issues at Roslyn. Multiple minor delays to get to the station which would typically be great luck for metro but of course you get into Roslyn just time to see the doors on the next train you need shut. Oh, and the train going in your direction 20 minutes later! Why the hell wouldn't they delay that train 30 seconds to let people on the train arriving board it knowing the delays. They just don't care about the riders. But more importantly why is the next train 20 minutes?The bottom line if you need to be somewhere metro is not a smart option unless you have all day to get there and you best be praying."
48,1,"Jun 5, 2018","The worst ever. You used to be decent in the early 2000's what happened to you? Smh. Thankfully my job pays for you. If not I'd catch uber. I'm either early or late thanks to you. Never right on time. My life...now, as gas prices rise you might see me a little more often. But geez. Am I really prepared? Probably not."
49,2,"Jul 7, 2020",Wow! I just want to live! There are so many people on these trains with their mask under their chin or none at all( including police officers). People can become so free until they are stupid! When stage ll arrives they are in trouble. You would be able to move into houses like The Walking Dead! Just pick a house and move in.
50,1,"Apr 13, 2018",Smart trip web portal is very bad user interface. Seriously bad.
51,1,"Aug 18, 2015","I just want a public transportation system that isn't on fire.  Is that too much to ask?When I first moved to DC in 2006, WMATA was a great way to get from Point A to Point B in a reasonable amount of time.  Over the past 9 years, it has gone downhill.  It is no longer reliable, and safety is a major concern.  I've been late for work at least once a week since 2015 started due to WMATA's incompetence."
52,2,"Jan 2, 2019","Since my '17 review, a lot on Metro has improved. Better headway adherence, automatic door openings, a vow to restore ATC this year, less fires and a higher MDBF. The last one can be attributed to the least reliable railcars being retired. The 7000s now make less noise because of a modification to the trucks--they weren't built to spec. Most problems are from the 7000s having manufacturing and design issues, but as of now, they are doing very well, beating out the 6Ks to the top. They will get rid of the 2 and 3Ks, which will probably bring up reliability, though I personally don't like the 7Ks or the 8K render. The 2/3Ks are the best in the system. Comfy seats, laid back lighting and big windows. 6Ks are similar. This won't hurt my star rating, though."
53,1,"Aug 4, 2017","Look. WMATA has worsend service, raised fares and cut costs. All on June 25. Also, please, tourists stop praising WMATA for being clean. It might be, at times nicer then the NYCT Subway, but at it's core with things like service it is clear that the NYCT Subway is better. The NYCT Subway may have de-railed 2 times in a month, but they haven't killed anyone in recent years. (Unlike WMATA Metrorail who has killed 9 riders since 2009, 1 worker who could not have prevented the 2009 crash, due to WMATAs lack of safety culture, including falsified logs that led to the death of a rider in 2015). Also, keep an eye out for WMATA hot cars and bad areas, as both can be deadly."
54,1,"Jun 28, 2018","Welcome to DC, where the WMATA charges you extra money to commute during normal commuting hours, where your round trip subway fare can actually cost $10, where you take the subway and they don't even use full sized trains during rush hour so you cannot get on the train, where you have to allocate your employer transportation funds over 10 days before the end of the month because this city can't seem to get its shit together enough to live in the 21st century where you can buy monthly passes on the fly. I hate the WMATA. They are useless and a waste of money and their customer service is the absolute worst I have ever dealt with. I had never been so angry at a public transit system. NYC is 5000x better that the POS agency."

60,1,"May 10, 2015","The convenience of traveling around the D.C. area on the WMATA Metro train is greatly outweighed by the constant delays and regular fare increases. I began writing this review yesterday as we were waiting for nearly 15 minutes at Braddock Road without an announcement for why we were just sitting there so long with the doors open. I am finishing this review currently sitting on a train at King Street (about 10 minutes now); but they have at least been polite enough today to announce that the delay is currently caused by single-tracking due to maintenance. Yesterday we left the train and just grabbed a cab to get into the city. I will still use WMATA because it is still the easiest way to get into D.C. I will always dread having to use it,  because it is a headache 9 times or of 10. It doesn't appear that the situation will get better any time soon, as we are always hearing about budget and management issues. All I can say is GOOD LUCK to all riders of the Metro!"

65,1,"Feb 15, 2017","I never thought I'd rate the metro, but here I am.Honest to God, this is one of the least efficient, most expensive, and overall worst public transportation systems I have witnessed. Growing up I've had the chance to use the Moscow metro (amazing), Paris (alright), Vienna, Prague, Munich, Berlin, and a few domestically like Chicago, Boston, and New York (amazing). WMATA very unfortunately pales in comparison with all of them. There are some pluses to it, but the negatives outweigh it for the most part.Cons:-Bus schedules are inaccurate and oftentimes late, and sometimes don't even come at all for no announced reason-Long wait times outside of rush hour (and decently long during rush hour occasionally too)-Very expensive fare structure (dependent on whether it is rush hour or not [which are very long periods], and the distance of the trip that you're taking)-Occasionally rude employees (I personally haven't had a problem with this)-Severe lack of competent management-Inefficient ownership/operation structure (different counties in 3 different states each have influence over the system, as well as influence form the federal government)-Boring architecture. Despite what the rest of America thinks, I don't like the brutalist concrete. Makes it look Soviet, which is ironic when you look at how the Moscow metro looks-No reliable access to the main international airport (Dulles). This is unheard of for a major city, and frankly embarrassing-Numerous safety issues (outdated technology, somewhat frequent malfunctions and occasional crashes, other major disruptions like safetrack)-Lack of dedicated funding-Confusing fare passes (28 day metro pass?)-Closing at midnight everyday for the foreseeable futurePros:-SmartTrip card paperless payment system-Somewhat convenient locations-Decent bus routes (D6 particularly great imo)-That's really about it honestlyOverall, despite being the second-busiest public transportation system in the country, WMATA is very poorly equipped to handle such a large flow of people consistently and efficiently. The safety issues are particularly pressing for the time being, but I think that the management and funding issues are overarching and will have to be addressed sooner rather than later so that going forward WMATA can be more beneficial and run smoothly."
66,1,"Mar 23, 2017","I have been taking the bus every day to and from work for over a year and let me tell you, it is the worst. Sometimes buses that aren't full will pass you by for seemingly no reason, which is infuriating. The bus I take to work is so poorly timed. It is supposed to come every 8 minutes. Instead, I see two buses right behind each other pull up almost every morning (of course I'm still two blocks away at this point and can't get there in time to catch it. I swear it's just like that episode of SpongeBob where they left bikini bottom and the bus would sneak past every time they werent looking). This double bus situation means that there won't be another bus for 16-20 minutes. I have sent wmata emails before but of course that was fruitless. I never expected anything else. With Uber and Lyft these days, it's also sometimes easier and cheaper to pool rather than really on this piece of garbage DC calls a Transit system. It's no wonder they are losing money. It's nothing short of what they deserve.Original post: passed by a bus 3/23/17Update: I think I'm just going to start keeping a running tally here of every time a bus passes me by accompanied by the date. 4/4/1710/2 bus was not full and it did not stop even after I waved my arms vigorously.

70,3,"Jun 10, 2014","Summary: it gets you where You need to go and is better than driving during rush hour, but can be lengthy wait times in evenings and with transfers. The DC metro system has it's ups and downs. And I'm not talking about the huge escalator heights at DuPont Circle or Bethesda. It's nice during rush hour for those of us not going on the most common and sardine'ed routes, and it will pick you up directly from DCA airport which is great. The problem is when it doesn't work, has major delays, and ""routine track work"". If they are going to close the subway of a major metropolitan area in the evenings, at 12am - 5 am Sun-Thursday, I would hope they could use some of this time to fix the issues. A few general statistics-trains are clean-prices are overpriced for public transportation-the trains are packed and run often during rush hour-trains have fairly comfortable seating-pretty good station proximities within dc proper-90% of the time comfortable tempatures-and oh hell, I hate when you miss a 9pm train by 15 seconds and have to wait 20-30 for the next one I'll keep riding, but there is a lot of room for improvement. They could start by hiring competent drivers that don't close the doors on patrons and know how to properly use the one thing they should be trained to use (brakes)."

No problem with the RIBS bus except for the arrival at the Whiele Metro Station.  Two years after the station opened the RIBS bus stop indicator sign had no knowledge that the Metro Station existed.Tried to use the WMATA trip planner.  Before I left my house it showed that I would have to wait for the train till 2:20.  At the the Whiele Station there was no.informstiom whatsoever about trains departing.  When I tried the internet connection to get the information I got a message that the information was not available.I uploaded $20 to my senior smart card and tried to go through a gate.  No luck, it would not open.  Went to the attendant in the booth who said on a gruff voice: ""Did you try the gate at the end!"".  It would never have occurred to me that I had to use s special gate.  Metro did not hint at any entrance restrictions.The public address system at the station was unintelligible.  Just knew they were having some kind  of a problem somewhereA train arrived at the platform at 1:59 PM started to leave the station, stopped and then backed into the station again.  The delay was about 5 minutes.The car on this new line was archaic.  No signs to indicate stops. The windows were so dirty it was very difficult to read the station names when we stopped.  The loudspeaker system and the train operator who had  no idea of how to talk on a public address system made the announcements  totally incomprehensibleAt the Metro Center station I missed the first Red Line train due to very confusing signs.The Red Line car was modern and had station indicating signs but naturally, they did not work.  At least the speaker system and the announcer were comprehensible.Why does the old part of the system have train departures clearly  and accurately shown while the brand new spanking Whiele Ststion doesn't?I pay the tolls to support Metro.  After this trip I will stop using 267.  I see my money is being wasted.I don't think money is the whole problem  I think it's the work culture of the management and employees that has created the current condition.We have the worst  Metro system I have ever used.  And I have used the systems in Hong Kong, Shanghai, Singapore, Paris. London, Chicago, New York and San Francisco.We should be ashamed that we have absolutely the worst system in the world!"

78,1,"Jul 17, 2016","Oh, WMATA, you've done it again. First, I attempted to use my SmarTrip card to head to the Nats game yesterday. My card, which had approximately $40 on it, mysteriously has a zero balance. After some research, this is apparently the result of WMATA ""archiving"" balances. The trend I saw in the reports is that you have to put more money on the card to ""retrieve"" your archived balance. This equates to both a ransom and fraud. I've scoured your T&Cs for the SmarTrip card and this is not mentioned. Second, the ""station manager"" was of absolutely zero help to me.  The ""manager"" in question was C Jackson of the Suitland station.  When I went to her for help, she was ""busy"" wiping off her desk.  She made zero eye contact and responded to me without even turning on her microphone so I could hear her.  Eventually, and fed up with the extreme disrespect, went back to attempt to just purchase another card since C Jackson was reluctant to do her job.  I'm sure this will not be a surprise to you...it wasn't to me -- BOTH farecard machines were out of order. When I went back to C Jackson, she didn't even bother to look up or respond to my plea for assistance. I left the station and headed to CVS to purchase a new card. There I was greeted warmly, assisted by the operations manager, purchased a new card and was in/out in less than 5 minutes total, including time spent in line. THAT is the type of person you need to hire as a station manager!To make matters worse, when I returned to the station to continue my trip, now late, I spotted two African American women having the exact issue I experienced.  I only mention race and gender for one reason...C Jackson saw, from her little booth, that they were experiencing issues and she promptly exited her booth and approached in an incredibly friendly tone and manner to assist. Here is my query:  Why did I not get the same respect and service?  Is it because I am a man?  Is it because I am white?  Is it because C Jackson is the wrong person for the station manager role?  My best guess is that it is a disgraceful combination of all of these reasons.This, WMATA, is yet another reason your ridership has declined. I've lived in the DC area all my life and have been a patron for many years. The service, both personal and mechanical, has severely declined over the last 10 years. I would also be curious to find out exactly where the monies that I am sure were budget line items every year for maintenance went?  It clearly did not go for maintenance, or the system would not be in this current situation causing a loss of more ridership.  I now have a new SmarTrip card, but have not recovered the existing monies WMATA has stolen from me...and there are countless others in the same boat.#UnsuckMetro"

I'm sorry. I first noticed her professionalism and grace as she asked a gentleman in a wheelchair his destination. I then noticed how neat and together and prepared she was ready to begin the journey to Northeast DC. We came near to my deatination and I had to ask how long she had been employed with the company. I was absolitely shocked when she replied, ""Thirteen-years."" After a brief conversation, I told her this job is not for her. She is intelligent, beautiful, tall, and professional. I, being divorced, at that moment with her yearned for such a beautiful human being. WMATA sucks but this drop dead gorgeous and intelligent lady is a shining example of a virtuous woman.

Now, I have thought about traffic as excuse, or other reasons about the wmata itself, but...if I were to tell a bus driver to sit at a stop and wait for me for even 2 mins, would they? So why is it acceptable for customers to wait even 10 mins? Or to come to their stops within reasonable time frame only to find that the bus came way too early? Not only this, but sometimes, bus drivers leave stops in a matter of seconds. There are certain stops, I don't know how to call them, where the buses are generally on ""stand-by"" for about 5 mins, but you have some drivers that take off in matters of second. This is not acceptable!Finally, the A/C and heating system is horrible. The air is always dusty, insanely dry--I come back home feeling sick everyday, since I have to take the transit daily. I'm so fortunately because since the temperatures out are not too wild, the a/c is off. But when it will get too hot, I will have to stay in most days.

All of those places have a transit system that makes the WMATA look quite incompetent. While there is nothing wrong with the cleanliness of the stations. Often stations sometimes aren't properly lit or trains don't come as often as they should in a populous metro area.   The buses are often late, often drivers stop without any explanation  and switch off which takes ten minutes of just sitting in a bus at a stop.

I filled out the Lost & Found form on the website.  After a few days I didn't hear anything.  I figured it was gone.  After 8 day's I received an email informing me my item was at the Lost & Found office.  I'm not sure of the whole story.  However, I would like to Thank WMATA.  The great people working at this organization made a rider a staunch advocate of the system going forward.   I would also like to include kudos to the Metro Police officers who have gone above and beyond in investigating a mysterious person harassing a female person in my family  during her morning commute.  This harassment happened a few times by the same individual.  I advised her to bring it to the attention of an officer located at the station.

109,2,"Aug 7, 2014","The continued degradation of the blue line over the past three years has been appalling. First came the switch from a one to one blue to orange train rotation to a 2 - 3 orange for every blue rotation.  Not only did this add at least 5 - 10 min each trip plus a fare hike, but the 2nd, and more so the 3rd, orange line trains are practically empty as everyone crowds into the first. Then came the yellow line ""rush plus."" Downed trains, track rotation problems and properly identifying each train as either blue or yellow has continued to plague wmata and they hit us with another fare hike and added an additional couple of minutes each way for each trip. Now we have the silver line, which arrived with a fare increase and an additional 10 - 20 minutes for each trip. For example, two evenings ago during rush hour, I waited 10 minutes for a blue at the Metro Center while 3 oranges and 2 silvers passed.  This morning during rush hour waiting at King String noted a 20 minute wait for a blue line. The only reason this is not a one star is that at least the trains are pretty much clean and rarely are without A/C or heating.  No clue why the blue line has been so abandoned with no other commuter solutions offered, especially for tourists (Arlington Cemetery) and travelers (Reagan National). Very disappointed in wmata."

I fail to believe that DC cannot come up with a system when every major city in Europe and in Japan operate more reliably and more consistently on a schedule, that it shames DC Metro by comparison. Even in the newer stations, WMATA fails to make the third rail, to bypass any trains that have broken down. The newer trains are nice, but far fewer than the trains that one consistently prays will hold together.This is strictly perpetual poor management. Even in the changes in the leadership, who promise communication, we get met with unannounced delays on the Blue lines, which leads to overcrowding on the Blue lines (moreso than usual). And the bus routes are best to plan with dice, than follow any sort of schedule printed on the kiosks. I've found even the Next Bus app to be wrong in when buses are to arrive, how far they are away, ect. To be frank, WMATA needs an almost complete overhaul.The daily workers on the ground, the labor force, are the only reason for the 2 stars, as they have to deal with the unrelenting complaints by the riders who have no alternative (due to parking being too high of a cost in DC), and being blamed for poor equipment and poor management. They do their best, but the suits up top? There is a rotten state in this WMATA, to match the smell of those brake fluid leaks in stations."

Beneath its aesthetically pleasing exterior (due to the system's relative cleanliness over other mass transit systems) lie a set of inconveniences that are frustrating at best and truly capture the film's comedy and horror at its worst.1) NEVER EXPOSE TO SUNLIGHT: In the film's climax, Gizmo, Billy's original mogwai, is able to eliminate the renegade gremlins by opening a set of blinds and exposing them to sunlight. It seems Metro trains have the same allergy to sunlight, as you'll frequently be trapped underground in an effort to hide from the sun's harsh UV rays. I have been trapped in the cavernous tunnels of the rail system so many times, that I've often wondered if I'll ever see sunlight again. As my daily commute keeps me within D.C. city limits, and I unable to confirm what happens at Metro's numerous outdoor stations outside of the city, but I can only assume that trains instantaneously combust when approaching stations such as Arlington Cemetery. 2) NEVER GET IT WET: When it rains in our nation's capital, as it has the majority of this past week, service grinds to a halt, resulting in 15 minute delays during rush hour and single-tracking due to train/rail malfunctions. Unlike gremlins, however, trains do not multiply when exposed to moisture, a defect that would actually improve service. It's unclear why God would design a creature that has such negative side-effects when exposed to water, one of the building blocks of life, but it is equally appalling that someone would design a system that is unable to account for rail problems, lacks an express service, and has stations that are so horribly designed, that you wonder if the designer has a grudge against humanity, similar to Stripe, the main villain of ""Gremlins"".3) NEVER FEED IT AFTER MIDNIGHT: To be fair, WMATA does a good job in discouraging riders from breaking this rule. As service at most stations terminate at midnight during the work week, there is not much opportunity to feed the beast that is WMATA your money, though service is extended on weekends. Luckily, the infrequent trains and unreliability of service often deters would-be riders from using the Metro late at night on the weekends. Smarter commuters opt for better options such as Uber  and other taxi services, while only the bravest (read: drunkest) travelers dare to tempt fate by breaking this cardinal rule.While I enjoy the whimsy of ""Gremlins"" as a motion picture, the real world manifestation of gremlins (that is, WMATA) does not capture the film's action and humor, instead replacing those qualities with crippling despair. LIke caring for your own mogwai, riding the Metro means you are subjecting yourself to a world of inconveniences that is both expensive and burdensome. Do not be persuaded by other yelp reviews that champion individual standout performances of lone WMATA employees or praise WMATA""s ease for tourists; those people just haven't seen ""Gremlins""."
114,1,"Apr 3, 2014",Metro trains are really worthy of a third world country. They are an embarrassment in our nation's capital.Ever been In stop-and-go freeway traffic? Metro trains are stop-and-go. 15 minute waits for your train at rush hour. Filthy trains. Inaccurate platform information. Balky entrance/exit gates.  The list goes on. The cities of first world countries seem to know how to do this. Of course it's political. I guess transportation subsidy is socialist.
115,1,"Jan 13, 2015","The DC metro is a privatized bussiness. I think this is the basic problem, some one at the top of this transit system is making lots of cash and doesnt have any incentive to keep it up to date. In a government centered city we should have access to a tranist system that isnt run by the private sector. Its dangerous, hostile and very expensive. Its at capacity, needs allot of renovation and updating. Its not normal to feel like the system you use to get to work isnt safe and is this costly. There should be ways to modernize it and make it safer.I just want to update my review......now the Metro is not safe to ride, it is routinely breaking down and filling with electrical smoke. I think cost is no longer the main concern its heath and maybe potential chronic breathing problems."

119,2,"May 1, 2014","I left a detailed review for the DC metro (rail) on the ""metrorail"" yelp page. So this is just a short review for the metrobus:I guess to me, distances I consider short are long to others because I walk a lot. I mean, I always wonder why there are so many stops in DC for the metrobus but I guess people in the states do not like to walk. But when I go on the 30 buses or N bus, E buses or some of the L buses, they have stops every 1-2 blocks and I always wonder why that can't be at least every 3-4 blocks or more. But sometimes I go to a stop and, even with my fairly poor vision, I can look down the street and see the next stop. Has metro ever thought of increasing the distance between each stop?  Because with some of these buses, it takes forever and a day to get to your destination. I figure you are stopping, on average, every half block almost. Either because of a red light, or a bus stop or to swerve around a police car or delivery truck. To me it is wildly inefficient. Plus, if you are at a terminus waiting for a bus to come out, sometimes they not leave in time.  Sometimes because a driver is fooling around but I guess there are other reasons too.  Not consistent enough departures to depend upon as this type of stuff can make you late.I would only depend on metrobus if you don't need to be anywhere ASAP, there is decent service (leaves every 20 minutes), you have a nextbus app and you are leaving from somewhere that is not close to a metro and is going somewhere that is also not close to a metro and the route is at least somewhat direct.  Otherwise, you are better off taking metro rail.  Drivers are hit or miss but some of them can be rude:  They rush people on and off just because they are running late on their route (why did you dick around so much before departing?), they DO NOT know their route well enough sometimes to give you proper advice on your desired destination, etc.  Other times, I have come across some lovely drivers.  I get the repetitive nature of the job must be awful, but try to look on the bright side, you are earning 65K/year to just drive.."
120,5,"Feb 18, 2014","This commendation letter is for the bus driver in route Y9 from Silver Spring station to Olney, MD in Montgomery County:I wanted to commend a bus driver route Y9, Mr. Caster, who I observed all his acts of kindness during my trip from Silver Spring Station to Georgia avenue in Olney, MD today, 2/18/14..I had the privilege to board Mr. Caster's bus. I have not taken a bus since 1996! Mr . Caster not only greeted me courteously and reassured me to get safely to my destination. Mr. Caster acknowledged each and every bus rider. Answered numerous questions while boarding and alerted all passengers how many minutes to departure time. Once Mr. Caster began his route, he treated each passenger with respect and care as he would find the safest area for each passenger to get off the bus. He would lower the bus and said goodbye to each passenger. One passenger for instance mentioned to him that she was going to Plaza del Mercado, Mr. Caster suggested to her a different stop where would be safer for her to walk. The area had been covered with at least 10 inches of snow and many sidewalks were covered. People walked along the main road and Mr. Caster would bring each passenger to the safest area each time. I was impressed by his dedication and care as he went above and beyond his duties. The passenger who was going to Plaza del Mercado got off safely and he even said to her to be careful and to watch for vehicles. That passenger seemed she had a disability and Mr. Caster treated her as he did each and every passenger, male and female, always looking out for their safety. I asked Mr. Caster for his name, his humility was such that he said it was not necessary for me to write a note that mentioning to him was enough. Mr. Caster made me feel safe, dropped me off at a safe location and conducted many acts of kindness throughout his route. I hope this note reaches Mr. Caster, he is an asset to our transportation system in Montgomery County.My kindest regards"
121,2,"Oct 14, 2011","Their rating should be somewhere between two and three stars. While metro is definitely clean, well organized and relatively easy to understand in DC it leaves a lot to be desired. Escalators never work, customer service is lacking, trains are often sharing tracks and experiencing lots of delays, and if you are commuting during rush hour plan to feel like you are in a can of sardines. Compared to many other metropolitan areas though metro in DC really isn't THAT bad."
122,1,"Jun 26, 2019","I haven't used the bus system, but as far as the train goes, I would avoid at all costs. There are no positives I can think of. During rush hour, trains should come every 3-5 minutes to accommodate the number of people riding at that time, especially in the middle of the city. Instead, the greenline trains that goes straight up through the city come every 7-9 minutes during rush hour. Twice in the last month I, along with a lot of other people, couldn't get on the train because it was so full, and the next one wasn't going to get there for another 8 minutes. You don't have that problem during the off hours, but just be prepared to stand on the platform for a while because the trains only come every 15-20 minutes. This is all assuming there aren't any delays due the track work that is somehow ALWAYS happening. I think $2 is expensive for the poor service you get, and that's the cheapest your ride will be. It could get up to almost $3 for one ride. Not very clean. Platforms are dark and dingy with mice scurrying around. Overall just not a good experience."
123,2,"Jul 3, 2012","Metro Train 1 star.  Metro Bus 3 StarNative Washingtonians who have never left the area are often not aware that the best trains have 2 routes - a local and express.  You get every route on WMATA trains as local.  This mean even if a person is going to the other end of the line, that person must endure every stop along the line! I must state some good things before I get into why I've observed why the Metro trains are so bad.The trains are clean.  No one is allowed to eat or drink (unless during a heatwave and restrictions are lifted for a bottle of water) on the train.  The escalators are under constant repair.  So riders don't see an abundance of rats on the tracks.My issue with the WMATA trains is the three C's:1. Cost2. Lack of Convenience3. Lack of CharacterWMATA trains charge for  both distance traveled AND time of day one travels.Riding from the start of the line to the end is expensive.  In addition, the service for riding weekdays during the rush hour is called the peak of the peak and extra charge is placed on that too.  Paying $12 one way is normal for DC.  Also, keep in mind that Federal Government workers have Metro Checks which pay for their rides.  The people who can most afford Metro get free rides into work while others must pick up the exorbitant costs.Secondly, lack of convenience is because the buses that did route from the county directly into the city were altered to go to the more costly Metro stations.  Taking the buses used to be cheaper and a bit less time consuming.  Now most bus routes in the county lead toward the Metro stations.  Riding one bus to the next with the transfer cuts costs for the rider.  I suggest checking the WMATA site for possible bus routes.  During the heatwave, in a CODE RED Metro buses are FREE to ride and are air conditioned.Also, I had a meeting in DC when I rushed like Cinderella to catch the train directly across the street at 11:50PM only to find that the last train going to my station left on a Thursday night.  I'd have to take 3 WMATA buses to get back to my car which was parked at a Metro lot!  These buses would take about 3 hours to get me there around 3-3:30AM!!!  DC Metro shuts down at midnight during the week!  This accounts for the lack of quality nightlife in the city.  Other places rely on convenience of public transportation to get riders in and out of town safely.  DC is two-faced in that they want you to visit, but leave when the 11:00 news comes on television.Riding the Metro trains, the stations have little character.  Sure no one is allowed to panhandle which is great, but no one is allowed to entertain at all.  Outside some stations, musicians recently have been allowed to entertain.  However once on the trains, the atmosphere is super conservative and lacks any energy.    Sure I want to get from point A to B at a reasonable cost in a reasonable amount of time, but having something fun around helps me forget that I just paid $5 to get from Union Station to the County and had local stops along the way!  Make sure that if you catch a bus from the train to get a transfer slip when getting onto the WMATA train.  No one will tell you this."
124,1,"Sep 30, 2015","This metro system has to be the worse in the coutry. Delays all day everyday. With all the money they charge how could there be so many mistakes. Having to go to sit on the train for more then a hr just to go ten stops is pathetic. Every stop we make it to, we are sitting for 10 additional mins. And again how can you charge so much money for such a flawed (the f word im choosing) system. I WISH I COULD GIVE NEGATIVE STARS"
125,1,"May 23, 2015","Avoid at all costs!  Had I known I would have to wait for an hour to even get a train to go 5 stops I would have taken Uber.  I've had nothing but problems with metro, long delays, constant problems and trains that don't arrive per the schedule."
126,1,"Apr 8, 2015","Yelp actually hides a lot of the negative reviews and does not factor them into the score. Just expand the ""not recommended"" reviews and see for yourself. WMATA should be 0 stars if it was possible. It is a classic example of a gov't-like entity full of waste, fraud, and abuse and is responsible for the DEATHS of a number of people over the years. It's cheaper to drive than to take the metro (the bus is fine though). All these excessively high fares seem to funnel into the pockets of the nepotistic employees of WMATA. What a fraud!"

Then bark go stand by the door ill be there!! Animal. Miraculously another person came out so i didnt have to wiz my pants dealing with this indignant spiteful person. I don't know why all the women that work for metro are categorically disgusting human beings and metro is only concerned about raising fares shoddy track maintenance weekend parking fare hike and sucking the customers dry... sub par service for 30 years. Theres a handful of decent guys working here but look if you hate actual work and getting up off your lard butt but like the checks get help it doesnt work like that. Im pro union but in this instance accountability is needed these people are allowed to be a joke of an organization much like their federal gubment friends. Sick of them.
129,1,"Feb 22, 2015","I concur with the rest of the comments here, very old I believe since metro opened in 1970 it hasn't been updated, and this is our nations capital! Always delayed and takes forever for the train to come. Comparing to the subway system in third world countries they are much better than DC metro. There are no signs inside the rail cars to know what stop is coming up, good luck figuring it out of you are a tourist, they suppose to announce it over the microphone like they use to do in the 19th century, but speakers are either broken or you can't understand what they are saying too. Escalators always broken and majority of the time facilities are always dirty with trash everywhere. The changes are coming in 2017, metro will be getting some new rail cars but that happened after numerous passenger casualties have happened due to poor safety conditions."

Because I've been around so many people smoking crack on BART and frankly, I'm not a fan! Can you get second hand crack? I sincerely hope not.BART is a decent option to get you to downtown centers and key neighborhoods around the Bay Area but holy hell somebody needs to clean it up! The needles, crack, violence and occasional indecent exposure are enough for me to avoid BART unless it's absolutely the best option. Parking in the city can be rough and sometimes nobody wants to give me a ride to the airport, so Im not gonna front like I don't hop on the occasional BART train and like it's not increasing access to travel in the bay. I'm just saying, it would be nice for it to be less nasty.Another issue is that BART could run a smidge later so those going out and drinking can use it to get home after the bars close. Overall, it's relatively reliable since you can track when the trains are arriving via Google maps and can plan your trip accordingly."

6,1,"Nov 7, 2023",Can someone please tell me wtf is that horrible smell that always comes in that tunnel right before West Oakland
7,4,"Feb 5, 2023",Bart in General is a great way to get around the Bay Area. With the introduction of Clipper on Apple Watch I no longer have to get my Wallet out in order to pay my fares. I simply double tap the side button on my watch and select Clipper. Wave my watch at the touch pad and the fare gates open. Makes it easy for travel.The bad is that there is a lot of people cheating the fare gate system. For example at Hayward BART when I exited in the handicap section of the station someone took advantage of the open gate and walked through. And at Bayfair when I used the elevator to enter the station because I don't fare well on some escalators someone took advantage of the open gate and left the station without paying. So BART is really not enforcing these fare cheaters while the fares continue to increase gradually. The attendants at the stations seem to not care. The only way the crackdowns happen is when actual BART police is at the station.When I visited San Diego and used the Trolley Service there were active fare inspectors on every ride I was on to make sure people paid and if they did not have a valid fare they had to vacate the paid area. Bart could learn a lot from them if they invested in active fare inspectors.

9,3,"Jan 3, 2023","There is no greater way to keep tabs on the pulse of a nation than by riding its public transportation, and let me just say, the United States appears to be doing very, very well. I know there are those out there who are, for one snobbish reason or another, hesitant to take such modes of travel. In light of this troubling attitude, I am willing to help BART appeal to this potential client base by putting a positive spin on a few of the less initially... attractive aspects of their service I encountered during a recent trip. Now, was the interior of the train covered with a wide variety of debris, including (but not limited to) socks, hypodermic needles, and a half-eaten chapstick? Yes, but this can easily be reframed. Rather than advertising their trains as ""filthy,"" BART can say that each car is ""a mobile community art project, filled with emotion and creative urban collaging.""Did the car smell like it housed twenty-five feral cats suffering simultaneously from rabies, mange, and food poisoning? Yes, but this can be repackaged as ""bringing the sights and smells of San Francisco with you as you go."" Were half of the seat cushions inexplicably ripped off their chairs, leaving rusty springs exposed? Sure - ""Each car has been redecorated in its own original way to keep with the changing times."" The man behind me who flailed around wildly and ate things off the floor and then attempted to smoke a crackpipe mere inches behind my head? ""You're almost always bound to meet a local guide with intriguing recommendations.""The complete lack of security presence or anything that would make a rider feel even remotely safe in these conditions? ""Ride in complete freedom, without fear of a tyrannical authority figure ruining your evening's fun."" Yes, BART is a lovely way to travel - just bring Lysol and weapons."
10,3,"Nov 18, 2022","I judge a city's public transportation chiefly on whether it gets me where I need to go. I can't say that's the case for BART, or frankly, any means of transit that doesn't operate 24/7. People need to travel after midnight, whether they're out on the town or headed to/from work. When that isn't an option, it creates problems. For me, this meant a difficult time getting from my hotel to the airport. For others, I'm sure they're more significant & can't always be solved by calling a cab.Trains aren't well maintained or especially secure, often with garbage & unhoused &/or mentally unstable types making riders feel unsafe."
11,1,"Jul 29, 2023","As a visitor, I found Bart a combination of confusing, broken, and expensive. The transit card purchased at the airport doesn't work elsewhere, which is not communicated anywhere. The card dispensing machines are mostly broken but not labeled as such. Our visa credit cards didn't work. We could only purchase 5 cards on our ATM cards but have a party of 6. There are so many modes that I cannot navigate how to get around. The clipper app requires that I provide my phone number and address. Why is they needed to ride a bus? What an unnecessary intrusion. I won't use it.I've travelled a lot, and this was a relatively stressful and difficult transit experience."
14,1,"Dec 1, 2022","Wow, I can't believe some of the BART stations do not take credit cards, only cash or debit.  I heard they are upgrading their ticket machines.  So many people don't carry much cash anymore.  Besides being expensive and nasty, why wasn't the machines updated 20 years ago."

Trains are dirty, smells like urine.  Most times, even on weekends, there are no seats available.

And people filed on and off without any riffraff.BART deserves a better rap... And it needs new seats with wipe-able, indestructible, recycled plastic fabric!And it needs the ironed on gum and detritus   scraped off the floor! And a good window cleaning!

18,1,"Jul 10, 2023","BART is one of the worst transit systems.  All the reviews about dirtiness, out dated cars, riders jumping the fare gates not paying are all true and the sad part of it all is that BART does not really care what the condition of their transit system is.  First the cleanliness of stations and trains -- People who clean stations and train cars are mostly part-time employees that BART does not budget for, so they spend a bunch of money hiring part-time employees who may stay for 90 days or less so you never have a steady amount of cleaning personnel.  Plus the way they clean is disgusting.  The mop that is used to clean the floor is the same mop used to clean the escalator handles.  Lastly, the elevators staying clean is the responsibility of the patrons to advise the station agent of the dirtiness so a janitor can clean it.  Actual signs are posted in the elevator alerting riders of this.Out Date Cars -- The cars are out dated, but don't worry they have those fancy new cars, but unfortunately, by the time all of those cars are on the rails the technology will be out dated.  The same technology BART thinks is so amazing on their new cars has been on cars in the NY subway system for years before BART rolled out the ""Fleet of the Future""....only question is at what point in the future?Checking Fares -- BART spent a bunch of money on individuals to check passengers to see if they paid their fare.  The only problem the amount they hired in comparison to the number of trains that are on during any part of the day resulting in this to be a useless program.  If they were serious about the fare issue they could have a conductor like trains such as Amtrak such have that go through the car and check tickets.  This one individual, or at least two individuals could easily go through the entire train for an entire shift checking fare payment.  Problem solved.Internal Culture -- The culture inside the organization promotes individuals who have no qualifications to be in positions they are in, or set qualifications that will exclude well qualified people from applying.  Sadly, some individuals are so arrogant in the organization is that they actually tell people who work under them that there is no reason for them to apply for a position because I am going to get it.  They call this professionalism...hardly.Overall, BART is not a good resource to use either as a tourist or a commuter.  As one reviewer said you are better off getting a rental car."

I can find no place to tell me how to add rides to card, or if the $3.00 is a monthly fee. Also in their contract they state they share your info and are not responsible for their content. They say I can use Google wallet, but I don't need one more way to access money or give another corporation my account data. Bart itself has a separate website you can't buy tickets from.

On July 1, 2018, at approximately 3:10 PM, I boarded the Dublin Pleasanton BART train at the Fruitvale Station with destination to the last stop in Pleasanton for the Alameda County Fair.Much to my disgust when I entered one of the cars, I could not sit in a certain section. I had to walk down to the other end of the car while the train was moving to find an available clean seat. What I saw was atrocious and the first thought that ran through my mind was why are they not doing maintenance inspection on these cars? Why even put this car in service when the seats are heavily damaged? I don't consider the condition these seats are in a safe one for passengers."

Shame on the people on both sides of the fence that they can't come to some sort of resolution/agreement on this dispute.  I feel for the people who have to rely on BART as their source of commuting to and from work.  For me, it's a different story.Ever since BART went on strike back in July, I had the good fortune to find another form of transportation for commuting to and from work - the San Francisco Ferry leaving from the Alameda Main Terminal.  I vowed never to return to riding BART, but I had to do so at least 5 times due to convenience.  The ferry boat ride cost me more, but to have a bar and restroom facility on board and then not worry too much about potential thievery of laptops and smartphones by some passengers who were scumbags, suited me fine.Now, the different story between the passengers relying on BART and myself is I stopped commuting to and from work since October 1.  I'm on a second journey in my life, and BART is not in the picture."
57,1,"Jul 29, 2022","Bart is the WORST transit system I have ever been on. I've been on several others and it's sad how terrible Bart is.

I've avoided Bart for years but decided to give it another shot since we're going to a baseball game and it's supposed to be the most convenient way to get there... and it's taken over 2 hours to go on a route that should take 1 hour a 4 minutes and we're not even there yet.

58,4,"Mar 14, 2018","Hey, It's BART!  Better than renting a car, paying tolls and parking, gas, etc.  It's cheaper, less stressful, and easy to use.  Cost is relative considering how expensive it is to drive in SF and find parking (nearly impossible or excessively expensive)Went from Oakland Airport/Coliseum to SF Powell St. costing $21.90 round trip (Yes $10.95 each way).  If you're flying, BUY the round trip ticket as the price will NOT change.BART has a tram that comes & goes to the airport and the Coliseum Station.  From that Station, you can catch the trains to any location in any direction (Fremont, Richmond, Pittsburg, San Francisco, SFO).Quiet ride today compared to other times because the trains operate on steel rails and wheel so at 70mph through the Bay Area tunnel can get VERY loud."

In San Francisco, the BART (and MUNI) seems cleaner and safter and more efficient.The prices seem a tad high to go to places like Fremont where it's like $7 each way or $14 round trip, but I guess you save on gas, bridge toll and time (not being in traffic).It's a fairly easy system to use and is self explanatory for newbies and out of town tourists visiting SF.I'd not say it's the best system nor luxurious, but does the job well I think."

I enjoy the bart, happy that it is doing good things for the environment too."
67,1,"Dec 26, 2021","We've been away from the Bay Area for two years. Before we left, I would have said that BART was a substandard subway system that was an embarrassment to the large and affluent Bay Area, primarily due to its limited schedule (it closes every night), its infrequent trains (with many lines only running every twenty minutes), its somewhat high prices (especially for longer trips or just crossing the Bay), and its overcrowded trains (especially during rush hour). I've ridden a number of other public transit systems in large, metropolitan areas, and BART is bottom of the barrel. But it used to be relatively safe and functional (though I was finding delays growing increasingly common at the time we abandoned the Bay Area, which I don't know if that's still the case or not today).Two years later, by which I mean two COVID years later, BART has become a horrific cesspool. Taking a long ride, from the south end of the line (in San Jose) to the northeasternmost stop in Oakland we encountered:(1) At least half-a-dozen homeless people, a number of them looking mentally impaired in some way. At least one of them wearing no shoes. This is an escalation of a problem a few years ago, when BART stopped policing homeless people from getting on trains and riding them as far as they wanted. They were often dangerously aggressive, sometimes dangerously sick, and rarely pleasant. A few years ago, I'd often see one in any car I was on for more than a few stops. Now, as I said, it was a half-dozen on a fairly long trip.(2) At least half-a-dozen people either not wearing masks or wearing masks that did nothing to cover their mouth or chin. It was the three or four that just didn't even bother at all that shocking me the most: that they were ever allowed on the trains in the first place.(3) One young man absolutely screaming into his phone the whole time he was on the train. He was also unmasked and so covering the end of the train (fortunately, away from me) in spittle.(4) Another man getting on the train, starting to scream at another passenger, literally chasing him through the train car, and then as he returned to his seat saying how he was going to kill a white guy some day. He was unmasked too, as was the white guy he chased through the car (but did not kill).Traveling with my luggage, feeling vulnerable as a result, and definitely feeling vulnerable about COVID with the omnicron variant cutting through the population, this was all around a pretty horrific experience. And I'm an experienced BART rider from my previous decades in the Bay Area, not some country mouse. I'm not convinced BART should be running if this level of (non) safety is all they can provide."

70,5,"May 10, 2017","I have a fairly light carbon footprint. I think probably the greatest thing one can do when living a green lifestyle is to be vegan & consume a plant based diet. After that transport plays a big factor. I have been car-free now for 13 years. I have been living in the Bay Area now for just over a year & take BART into San Francisco from Oakland at least thrice a week if not more for work. It is a reliable form of transport to commute into the city from the town. I also love using BART to go into Berkeley & other parts of the Bay Area. Much of this time of living car-free I have primarily been a bicycle commuter. It has helped living in some of the best bicycle commuter friendly places in the nation such as Portland, Boulder, & Eugene. Since moving to the Bay Area I primarily commute by BART along w/ walking.I last owned a car when living in Los Angeles. Los Angeles is quite car centric & was built w/ the car in mind. It was built around the freeway. After living there a year back in the day & having to content w/ gridlock bumper to bumper traffic on the freeway I was happy to finally give up owning a car all together. Besides living a green lifestyle & helping the environment being car-free is also far less costly than owning a car. Think about insurance, upkeep, gasoline, parking, & more. Sure being car-free isn't for everyone. Some people need a car when living in the suburbs or in rural parts yet being car-free works for me. I can understand people w/ kids might also depend on a car for day to day life. Living in the city car-free works for me & is a lifestyle I enjoy living!For cities in the United States the Bay Area is often ranked second in best public transport trailing behind NYC. I was born in NYC & had my first job there when I was 15. While in NYC my preferred mode of transport was walking & taking the trains. I much prefer BART over the bus systems here as there is something about travel by train that is nice. While NYC might have a more efficient & less costly subway system the Bay Area has a better climate. There is no snow or ice to content w/ in the winter. The summers aren't hot & humid like NYC.The BART isn't a perfect system though & does have it's shadow side. Perhaps Sat & Sun could be as efficient as M-F & ditto for holidays. There is sometimes delays, sometimes construction, sometimes escalators are out of service. There isn't one set price like in NYC as rides cost by how far you travel.Still all in all having a Clipper card is the way to go & you can always top it up as you need. Sure it might get crowded at times & you might have to stand yet this is nothing compared to taking the Metro train in New Delhi, India where commuters are packed like Dolmas in a tin. All in all I love BART. Having entertainment on the train on occasion such as breakdancers or people busking performing live music at times is part of the fun like NYC subways in the day."

75,1,"Jul 7, 2018","BART, Bay Area Rapid Transit, should stand for Bloody Aggravating Repugnant Transit (or Fucking Annoying Rapid Transit), in my opinion.  It's AWFUL.  OK, I'm basing this on ONE experience, but it's enough for me to think, ""Never again!""The afternoon of July 1st, my partner and I flew into SFO, and being from Vancouver, we don't have ride sharing, so getting an Uber or Lyft from the airport wasn't a possibility (I've since signed up for a Lyft account and downloaded the app), and a cab would have been horrendously expensive, so we decided to take BART, an unwise decision.  First, there weren't enough BART ticket machines at the airport, despite there being more than enough space to install more, so there was a long lineup to purchase tickets.  Second, not all machines took cash, so we had to pay with our credit cards, thus paying high foreign currency exchange rates.  Third, there was no information on how much our ticket would be, but we didn't have the option of purchasing a ticket for less than $20 anyway (which, in Canadian dollars, with the credit card exchange rate, came to $27).And the trip itself was an absolute nightmare.  The trains were dirty and disgusting, and uncomfortably crowded.  Coming from the airport, we had a large suitcase, two bags, and a knapsack, so trying to exit the train was very difficult.  And as I was trying to make my way to the door, I accidentally brushed against a woman who made no effort to let people pass, despite saying, ""Excuse me"", and she flipped the fuck out on me. Yeah, pleasant ride. The price of our ticket turned out to be outrageous -- nearly $11!  Because we were two people, that's over $20 in transit fare, and because we each had to purchase a BART card with $20 on it, we actually paid $40 (or $54 Canadian with the extra currency exchange fee).  At that price, I would have preferred to pay extra for the comfort of a cab.  After all that, we now had two useless BART passes with over $20 worth of fare on them, which we were never going to use again because we were so disgusted with the experience.  (Thankfully we were able to give our cards to our friends, who use the BART.) There are some cities in which you can take transit from the airport, but like Berlin, San Francisco is not one of them.  This has been one of the worst airport transit trips I've taken, even worse than when I got punched in the face on the metro in Prague!  Getting punched in the face is better than taking BART from the airport.  And cheaper.[Yelp collections: West Coast 2018; Planes, Trains, and Automobiles]"
76,4,"Jul 1, 2016","For my 50th review, I have been thinking which business establishment should I do for this milestone of mine. And my 50th review coincided with my holiday in San Francisco, one of my fave cities outside of LA. I'm writing this while on board the BART train from Concord to Daly City. So my 50th review is now dedicated to none other than....BART! I can't think of anything more fitting.Just like the metro rail system in Chicago, I love taking this train going around NorCal. It's so convenient to just hop in to go from one place to another. The coaches are clean, air conditioned, not stinky and passengers are well behaved (based on my personal experiences). It's always on time and every station is well maintained as well. The price for one way at $6.30 is not bad at all considering how far you can go on a single trip. There's also daily and mostly pass options available based on your need. Seniors and students can also avail of discounted passes at $2.35 one way. The only thing that annoys me is not the actual train system itself, but some passengers who don't observe the big sign that says priority seating for seniors and persons with disabilities. It annoys me to see why people who deserves the seat are the ones standing up. Today, I have to give up my seat to a mom who has a little girl with her because no one is willing to. A simple kind of kindness won't hurt you people. And one more thing BART, as much as I love you, please keep the restrooms cleaner."

80,3,"Dec 19, 2019","BART, or Bay Area Rapid Transit, began operations in the early 70s and almost seemed visionary, with its then modern '70s stations, free landscaped parking lots, turnstiles that went ""woosh"" in response to your magnetic strip fare card, Jetsonian looking rail cars, and smooth riding upholstered train cars with carpeting.  For many who live and lived in the Bay Area, it made everyday life a lot more convenient and commutes more feasible.  For out of towners, it made visiting the Bay Area more of a treat than it already was.BART is not perfect and so, on my last review, it got 4 stars.  Finally, BART has reached SFO ... for quite a while, actually.  It also has a people mover spur in the East Bay that can connect you to Oakland Airport (OAK) from the lines running up and down the east side of the bay.  Furthermore, BART has made some notable eastward expansions in the East Bay, out beyond San Ramon and Antioch (on 2 different lines).  They are also extending southward toward San Jose with the opening of the Warm Springs station, complete with all the new transit oriented development it has spurred, all set within sight of those typical oak studded brown hillsides of much of California.However, I feel that BART has slipped in many ways.  The first noticeable thing is how unkempt the rolling stock and many stations have become.  Now, instead of sampling a happier cross section of Bay Area denizens, you get to sample the more divided populace of the area, as in the haves and have nots.  In some cases, the theatrics in stations, at their entrances, and aboard the trains can go a little over the top.  While the Bay Area seems to be at the forefront of legislating and embracing so much special snowflake political correctness, you can't hold unhappy and unwell people to that yardstick.   I did get a quick look at some new rolling stock, which doesn't appear to have the trademark slanted back vehicle at its ends, as it was traveling on another track and it is much needed.  It's about time.Ticket prices are high, as are the prices for subway and train tickets in comparably priced New York City.  Each ticket price is dictated by the station pair, be it SFO to Oakland City Center or Richmond to Warm Springs.  Monthly travelers have some sort of loaded card that comes with integrated fare discounts, but point to point fares are still high.  Fares originating or ending at an airport must have a surcharge in them because they are much higher than if you began that same trip just one station away, and not in an airport.  However, it is much cheaper than taking a taxi or Uber/Lyft and much more ""direct"" than taking one of the big buses or coaches, such as SamTrans, to the airport.  With that said, BART does not have any sort of unlimited 1 day, 3 day, or weekly pass while the transit systems of many expensive U.S. cities do - I'm talking Los Angeles, Chicago, Miami, and Boston, to name a few.  Visitors to the area who want to be civic minded and use the system extensively get soaked in the process.BART is approaching 50 years of service and, while the more recently expanded segments of the service area aren't as worn, the original segments are starting to show a good deal of wear and tear.  I'm sure the overhead of running such a system, which was way ahead of any such system elsewhere in California, must be daunting.  However, with its inflows of funds, BART needs to keep the stations and trains cleaner and safer for what you pay.  But, it's to be expected.  Like most things in the Bay Area, they are never priced with much correlation to the value you receive.  BART may have 4 letters and once really merited its 4 stars.  However, it now just sort of ekes out 3 stars.  For those who give BART 1 star, and some of the experiences they describe point to why they are doing so, how would you feel about not having it at all?  And, since BART is behind the 8 ball in so many ways, I sort of feel that, even without penciling it out, those who oversee the system know they have a captive audience and could do better."
81,4,"Apr 29, 2013","BART was the coolest thing under the sun when it was newish.  BART = Bay Area Rapid Transit.  As kids, we used to ask each other what the Fresno area would call their system if they got rapid transit.  Hardy har-har.  Kids.BART made all the sense in the world.  The Bay Area very badly needed an alternative to connect riders from its East Bay counties of Alameda and Contra Costa to the city of San Francisco across the vast bay.  When newer, the trains were sleek and cool, but now look dated and scuffed up.  The front of the cars were raked back, unlike the traditional subway cars seen in New York or Chicago.  The interiors featured both cloth seats and carpeting. The stations were modern and the whooshing sound of your ticket going through the turnstile was kind of cool.Pros:  A sensible layout that has continued to serve more communities in the East Bay, it now goes into airport at SFO, there are plans to go into the South Bay (but only along the East Bay), a nice smooth comfortable ride and ideal climate control, and the harmless quirkiness of the Bay Area on display (and the stories that go with that).Cons:  expensive - a ride from some far flung location such as Pittsburg/Bay Point or Pleasanton into the San Francisco airport is $$$, it doesn't hug the side of the Oakland airport and auxiliary transit is needed to get into OAK, some trains need to be cleaned up, the South Bay extension won't go all the way into San Jose and it should, and most of all, the idiocy of San Mateo County is legendary - they didn't want it THEN so it doesn't go down toward San Jose on the Peninsula side of the bay.  Wouldn't BART have been WAY better than Caltrain, with its at-grade configuration and limited hours?If the South Bay extension along the East Bay and a theoretical San Mateo/Peninsula line existed, and both met at San Jose, and cars and stations were slightly modernized, BART would be perfect.Also, there is no cost-benefit to crossing over north into Marin County, since the population base is low and most people who live there have enough money to wipe their asses with, as in ""What, moi on a subway car?""Even if you are a tourist, a BART ride is cool.  You can either take it to the SFO airport or ride it to Berkeley on weekends when there is the open air market on Shattuck Avenue and the tie-dyed crowd stuck in some time warp is on display as much as the very crap they sell."
82,2,"Jun 21, 2018","BART would be so great if the management would focus on the quality of life issues and the basics.  The homeless crisis has spilled onto BART, most riders don't feel comfortable locked in a carriage with people that are in the midst of a crisis.  It's also an issue at the stations.  On a couple of occasions I left and took UBER because things were too crazy.  While on this topic, riders deserve clean carriages and facilities, but the homeless issue has destroyed order and cleanliness.See attached photo of a guy strung out on something (probably heroine) who was on when I boarded at Embarcadero and rode to SFO.  No BART enforcement to police this."

84,3,"Feb 22, 2016","When it comes to public transportation, I think BART is fine. It's functional, in many cases practical, and it gets you from Point A to Point B safely, affordably, and reliably. Sure, some of the stations aren't clean, the trains and buses can stink, and you have to deal with other people (the horror), but it's not any different from most other public transit systems around the world.BART's fare structure is different and more expensive than other public transit systems I'm familiar with in the U.S. Specifically, I'm talking about New York's MTA (Metropolitan Transportation Authority) and Atlanta's MARTA (Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority). Both MTA and MARTA charge a single flat rate per ride, $2.75 for MTA and $2.50 for MARTA. BART, on the other hand, charges based on distance. Instead of paying a simple, cheap, flat rate, BART riders have to calculate in advance how much their ride is going to cost.There are a couple ways I've calculated my BART fare:1. Use the fare calculator on BART's web site at https://www.bart.gov/tickets/calculator. Just enter your origin station and destination station and the web site will tell you how much the ride will cost.2. Use the fare schedule inside the train station. It's a large matrix of fares. Just match your origin station to your destination station to find your fare.A one-way ride on BART can cost as little as $1.95 (e.g. Montgomery St to Embarcadero) to as much as $12.05 (e.g. San Francisco International Airport to Pittsburgh/Bay Point). Yeah, it can get relatively expensive, but you're bypassing all the traffic in San Francisco, the Bay Bridge, and the East Bay, not to mention saving on gas money and tolls.Unlike other public transit systems, there is no charge to purchase a BART ticket. All you need to pay is your fare and the ticket kiosk will spit out a BART ticket with the amount you paid on it. For simplicity, I recommend using your credit card to purchase your BART ticket. Once you've swiped your credit card, you can add or subtract money onto your ticket in increments as little as $0.05. BART fares always end in multiples of $0.05, so be sure to add the correct amounts to your BART tickets so you never waste any money. (The New York MTA has collected over $500 million in unspent balances. http://www.yelp.com/biz/metropolitan-transportation-authority-new-york-4?hrid=QYfJhmXo1eViCW6Ahl9tYw)BART trains and buses see a lot of ridership and for good reason - gas is expensive in the Bay Area, traffic can really suck (especially on/around the Bay Bridge during rush hour), and parking in San Francisco can be expensive and/or difficult to find. The trains are worn and smelly, even the refurbished ones with the ""new"" vinyl-covered seats. At least they got rid of the cloth seats which were easier to stain, harder to clean, and retained odors for longer periods of time. I think they should convert all seating to a curved, easy-to-clean, hard surface.The trains and stations can get absolutely packed during rush hour. I've been on my fair share of rides across the bay during rush hour in both directions. Once, I took BART from the airport to Montgomery St station on a Monday evening at the peak of rush hour. There were so many people inside Montgomery St station, lined up for trains or entering/exiting trains, that it was basically impossible for me to physically get out of the station tugging my carry-on roller bag behind me. I had to lift the bag and hold it in front of me to squeeze by everyone, from the train platform all the way up the steps. It wasn't a big deal, but certainly an annoyance. So just be aware of that. In those instances, some people may find a more comfortable private ride (e.g. taxi, limousine or shuttle service, Uber, Lyft) worth it."
85,1,"Apr 13, 2022",Always running late. Do not take Bart in the morning for work I have been late everyday this week and have arrived to the Bart 2 hours prior to my shift.

In the 2.5 months of riding BART between S.F. and Milbrae, there have only been 3 people not wearing masks and 1 sick individual not properly wearing his mask. But it was not a big deal as the cars were almost empty except for 5-10 people.Tonight, the train sat 10 min. at a stop--it seemed that the trains stopped running for that duration as a ton of people piled on at the next 2 stops. The cars were so full that people were standing 1 foot apart. So much for social distancing during Covid!"

Now that you've entered the train, it's time to take a seat, right? That easy, right? Hmm, well you look around for a seat... Homeless guy with his pants half down is sitting over in this corner. There's some moldy crusty food that's starting to take on a life form of its own in the crevices of this seat. Maybe I'll sit there? Naa, there's some unidentified liquid (probably piss) on the ground there. Ehh, I'll just stand (good exercise anyways). Hol' up, goddamn, it stank, though. When was the last time they cleaned this train? I'll move to another train, no biggie. I just gotta open 2 sets of doors. Good thing they both weigh like 170lbs to open. This train is much better, but f**kin hell. Why is this wannabe kid blasting his trash music for everyone to hear at 7:45am???Seriously, BART. Get. It. Together. Learn from the Japanese and their rail system. It's clean, fast, and efficient. Man, am I glad I got my own car and no longer have to ride the BART.And how the hell did the Berkeley Bart construction project take like 4-5 years??? Is there any accountability? What a waste of taxpayer money. I came to the bay in 2011 doe-eyed and full of optimism when I saw ads all over saying that Bart would be expand into the South Bay. It's now 2020, and I would be surprised if Bart made any more progress beyond Warm Springs before I died. Everyone needs to be fired and the bureaucracy needs to be trimmed down."

The deeper into San Francisco or Oakland your origin point, the more assaulting the approach. The stench is a flesh-melting mixture of dirt, mechanical oils, rotting food and bodily fluids, with just a hint of musk (likely from bodies packed together like sardines during rush hour). If this effluvium isn't enough to curdle the contents of your stomach (one reason I ride before meals), a riling game of ""Bop-It!"" with a tired ticket machine should do the trick!Good luck navigating the droning prompts on this monochromatic would-be slot machine, whose buttons are permanently caked with a mysteriously sticky film. The machine trills and chirps at you loudly with each button press, inching towards your desired ticket-amount in nickel increments only to spit out chunks of loose change in a guttural rattle, no matter the denomination you sunk into her hungry cash receiver. When you finally get your ticket  -a flimsy, magnetized piece of paper- you waddle over to the turnstiles, heavy from the change weighing down your swollen pockets. You wait in line for your turn to play Operation with the mechanized ticket receiver which, if you're lucky, will carry your precarious paper ticket through her internal levers and spit it out at the other end, admitting you into the station.  **DON'T FORGET YOUR TICKET**If you forget to grab your ticket, an exciting conversation with a slate-faced station agent to explain the lost ticket awaits. A conversation that will make a Pap-Smear or colonoscopy seem pleasant by comparison. When you reach the platform, your train has been characteristically delayed by some accident or malfunction. As your mind wanders, you fight back the ever-looming fear of getting trapped at the base of the trans-bay tube. You're saved when your train grinds into the station with a ground-shaking rumble, trailing a putrid gust of wind that thrashes your face. The train lets out a series of thunderous bellows (think fog horn meets elk's mating call) warning you off the neon yellow braille mats lining the platform, away from pulverizing train wheels and the much feared electric third rail. As her doors open, a wave of angry pedestrians trample towards you with straight, angry faces as the train operator rushes a garbled directive through the P.A. system. A new mixture of smells and sounds assault your senses as you weave your way onto the cacophonous car.  You brush past a sweaty vagrant, an over-cologned businessman, a morbidly obese woman eating yesterday's fish sandwich, a hooded figure cursing obscenities at the air, a group of loud teens swilling concealed alcohol from a soda bottle. You press yourself between two seemingly-innocuous riders to grip a grease-streaked steel bar for support and settle into the zesty toilet-bowl aroma.  For the duration of your ride, the train churns and screeches through the bowels of the city, snaking its way between dirty, halogen-lit station after station as you struggle to avoid direct eye contact. At last, you are belched out of the car at your final destination, paraded up the stairs by the anonymous mob of fellow-riders and set free."

It isn't perfect, but it's far better that what the greater general Los Angeles area has. And with public transportation allowance given by my office, EVEN BETTER. So, yeah. I'm a fan."
97,1,"May 11, 2019","I just used BART to get from the San Francisco airport to downtown San Francisco in the beginning of May 2019. BART is the WORST form of public transit I've ever taken. It's even worse than the bus and I hate buses. (I've taken the London Underground, Paris Metro, Beijing Subway, Washington DC Metro and they are all very easy to use and well run subway systems. And their cars don't screech.)When you ride on BART, you really need earplugs. The metal wheels and the tracks are obviously installed incorrectly and the sound inside the BART cars make an extremely loud screeching sound for the entire ride. This is wrong and all politicians and BART management should be ashamed of themselves. In fact, new politicians should be voted in to make the BART system a good subway system. Shame on all people who purchased the BART transit system and shame on all the politicians who are doing nothing to repair or replace the entire BART rail system with good mass transit rails and cars. All of the BART cars are old and disgusting looking. The seat covers are old and disgusting as well.I was in Beijing, China in 2010 and rode their underground mass transit system. It was extremely easy to figure out how to get from Point A to Point B. I know ZERO Chinese. The subway stations were beautiful, clean, and set up to help move a huge amount of people with ease and with the least amount of walking, from the street to the boarding point for the subway cars. The subway stations are extremely clean and welcoming for passengers. The subway doors are evenly spaced and throughout the entire car so it's easy and fast for lots of people to exit and enter each car. The subway cars are very fast and quiet. Inside each subway car, above each and every door, is a lighted map showing each stop. Plus the lighted signage shows which stops the subway cars have already stopped and which stops the subway car is going to. The subway lighted map system (inside the car and above EVERY door) has both Chinese characters and English underneath each stop, to make it easy to know where you want to get off the subway. San Francisco politicians and transit system people need to:1) Ride the BART system and ruin your ears and be ashamed of the transit system you have and then...2) Take a trip  go to Beijing, China and see how a real city runs a very clean, extremely fast, quiet, and easy to use subway system. 3) Then these politicians and transit management types should be tried for being incompetent, corrupt and lazy, and have them serve prison time. 4) New politicians need to be voted in and new transit management put in place, go to Beijing, learn from the Chinese. 5) Then have these competent management oversee a complete revamping of the BART system with new rails, new subway cars, renovate all subway stations including re-engineering the subway stations with too long of a walking distance from street to the subway car. New and easy to read and understand signage needs to be in all subway stations and inside all the subway cars. And for goodness sake, add the subway car name to the outside of the sides of all the subway cars, so when they arrive at a station, it's easy to confirm that that exact subway car is the one passengers want to take, and so that the signage on the outside of the subway car will match the boarding area signage on the inside of the subway station.And make sure that the new subway cars have lighted signage (a lighted map with all the stops for that subway line) inside and above each subway door (like they have in Beijing, China) to make it extremely easy for passengers to know when to leave the subway car.And the new subway cars should have evenly spaced out doors to allow easy access for people during rush hours. And if you are really clever, you'd have a permanent wall between the subway tracks and the boarding area in the subway station so people can't fall or jump in front of a subway car, like they have in Beijing, China. San Francisco, ever heard of safety first?6) Don't allow the homeless to reside in the subway stations. Have security guards at the entrance of every BART station and don't allow the homeless inside. Locals and travelers don't want to see homeless people sitting and begging them for money, don't want to hear the homeless yelling and screaming, smell the rancid orders from these homeless and don't want accosted by the homeless."

Now, the trains have a lot of issues and it's pretty often. In the winter time you're often likely to get on a train with its air conditioning on (which I don't mind as I love cold weather), but in the devils heat you are also likely to board a train with the heat on which is sickening. Whether it's a ""Medical"" emergency, police activity, or just some unknown delay...it happens a lot. The trains are pretty clean for the most part, but the employees can come across as unhappy and treat everyone the same. A paying passenger doesn't often look like a homeless person begging or trying to ride for free, but some Bart employees act like you simply don't matter whether you are polite or not.     I will share one of my experiences with a sad Bart agent...the clipper card was recently introduced and the Bart system was not fully prepared for clipper. My clipper card did not work at several of the gates so instead of holding up other passengers I went to ""See Agent"" as the machine instructed. I politely told the agent good morning and explained that I tried to use my clipper card and it would not work...the agent came out stating ""you just want me to work today..."" was serious and not joking with me. They got it to work after running it across the reader MANY times, and told me I just have to do it right next time. I thanked them kindly and went to work.

101,3,"Mar 24, 2015","Took the BART from the San Francisco Airport. First time riding the BART. It travels pretty fast. It took awhile to get to our destination which is Dublin. We had to find the one that goes to Dublin. It has different lines and destinations, so make sure you get on the right one. I did not care for the loud noise as we traveled. We went under a water tunnel and it literally popped my ears which hurt a little. I did not enjoy that. It did not seem to affect the normal people who ride the BART on a daily basis. The ride was fairly smooth and it got to our destination pretty fast. My husband bought prepaid cards for the BART. We just wave them in front of the scanner and it let us in and out. I think my husband loaded around $40 in the card which should be enough to get us back to the SF airport when we leave from our visit in Dublin. I do like how friendly the attendant was at the 12th St and Oakland stop. She helped me swipe my card on the machine because it was not working. She was very helpful. There were some strange characters on the BART as with any public transportation. I saw a guy haul in a shopping cart in the BART which was funny. Also saw a couple of guys dance for entertainment and then tried to collect money. I guess that it typical with any type of public transportation. It was an okay experience."

It really as of yet does not have much of a footprint in the South Bay, though one line does extend to San Francisco International Airport (SFO) and another line terminates at Millbrae.THE SETUPMass Transit will always have it's issues.  It's a total crapshoot whether one bases transit on:* ""TIME"" - as Sacramento does with it's Light-Rail and Buses - you purchase the pass/ticket and you have a 2 HR window to travel within; or on, * ""DISTANCE"" - as BART does when calculating how much to deduct from the ticket as you exit from a particular station.BENEFITS I find it is much cheaper and less stressful to hit the rails (Amtrak AND BART) than deal with gas, the tolls, the traffic commute anxiety, law enforcement, wasted time, etc. etc., especially if I can leave Sacramento in the middle of the afternoon, do my thang in SF/Oakland, and return to Sacramento before Midnight / 1AM - then it's totally worth it to travel down Amtrak and catch BART.ENTERTAINMENT!And once in a while, you even get to see some impromptu shows by the local dudes who have their music and magic dance moves to keep people like me entertained.https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bart-oakland-2?select_video=d9J7e2uo-a0S0XMuw1CS-ATHE LOWDOWNIt certainly pays to travel by mass transit on some occasions."

Within the first 10 days of January, we've had one major morning disruption that resulted in a 2 hour delay and an evening disruption that paralyzed the system for over 5 hours due to a single fallen tree towards the end on the San Francisco line. Even on good days that have supposedly ""good"" service, the delays during morning commutes are 15-20 minutes. Typical pathetic attempt at service from BART."
108,1,"Nov 10, 2016","The average delay for BART during rush hour is now 30 minutes and 1 hour during off hours. I am currently on a platform in San Francisco at 9pm, and they just closed 1 of the only 2 tracks in and out of the station. 1 track for 4 different train lines.  Their incompetence is on a level that is criminal. As I have repeatedly said in the past BART must be sued at a class action level."
109,1,"Sep 28, 2016","A month after my previous review, no improvement whatsoever was made. Severe delays were experienced on average 5 days out of 5 on every work week. They are so poorly organised trains going to the exact same destination show up at the same station at exactly the same time! An issue you would think would affect buses more than trains, but BART manages the impossible. And not only do they not improve, they get increasingly worse when it comes to reliability. Trains get later and later throughout the week until they're showing up 5 minutes late, not including delays you will encounter further down the line. In most countries 30 seconds late is considered unacceptable but for BART, you should just be grateful BART employees bothered to show up for work, albeit in their unwashed and unkempt ""uniforms"".Conditions on BART trains themselves are dire as well. Over the past week there has been a heat wave in the Bay area. The heat inside the train cars generated from body heat from all the packed passengers along with the greenhouse heat from the lack of air conditioning made the trains very suffocating.Conditions in BART stations are horrendous. Besides the filth and the infrastructure from the 19th century. BART doesn't seem to have the concept of air filtration for the air in their stations. If you catch a glimpse of the station air through the rays of light during sunset, you will see just how thick with dust and who knows what the air is. It cannot possibly be safe to breath the air on BART. There is also very little police or security around BART stations and passengers are often harassed by individuals who are intoxicated, drunk, delusional, or being approached for money by ""street performers"". The number of delays resulting from ""criminal activity"" at stations prove my point. If you are reading this and you are a good lawyer, or know someone who is, please consider starting a class action lawsuit against BART or the BART workers union. They consistently failed to meet their schedule or provide the service thousands of people pay for everyday. That should be false advertising at the least and passengers should be refunded all their fares for the last year, if not more. Have someone measure their reliability scientifically of you must but this is a solid claim.Furthermore, lawsuits should also be filed in regards to the neglect they have made in regards to passengers' health and safety; whether it's the heavily polluted air (scientifically measurable) or the overheating and suffocating train cars (also easily measurable). This would make a long lawsuit but the claim base will be huge."
110,1,"Aug 30, 2016","It's official. BART is the most miserable excuse of public transport systems in the world. Don't really know where to start. For many people who commute to work everyday, and thanks to Bay Area traffic driving is not an option, they are forced into using BART. However, if you think the existence of BART solves the issue of Bay Area commuting, you'd be dead wrong.BART has a schedule that they list on every station, the kind of schedule legitimate public transport systems have; you may have seen schedules that resemble it in other countries or cities. It's a very rudimentary schedule, the kind even an ape would be able to follow. Yet it is all a cruel prank on its passengers. Simply put, if you plan to get to your destination by following the BART schedule, you will NEVER arrive on time. I can't recall a single day where trains where not delayed by some sort of excuse (mechanical failure, criminal activity, smoke in train, pants on fire, whatever). If it happens just once, it's an understandable mishap. But when it happens 4 out of 5 working days EVERY WEEK, then it's more down to the system and the people who run it. One has to wonder how many screw ups it takes to mess up a system where trains run from Point A to Point B on preplanned schedule on a closed track. And these jokes who called themselves BART employees still have the nerve to go on strike and ask for better wages.In short, if you need to get somewhere and have the option to use something other than BART, use that thing other than BART. But if you enjoy being stuck in dark tunnels for unknown amounts of time while being lied to about why you're being stuck in said dark tunnel and in the company of too many people with little to no air conditioning, BART has your back."
111,1,"May 15, 2016","Always late, unreliable, filthy cars and overpriced. Those are just a few civil words I can think of for the Bay Area Rapid Transit.BART is a joke of a public transportation system that is run on an antiquated system and ancient hardware by a group of employees who are lazy and self entitled. For an area known for technological advancement, BART is truly a disgrace to the area. To those of us who have lived in parts of the world with an actual public transportation system, there really is not even a single quality to BART. There is no system to speak of, trains just show up whenever conductors please, usually 3 to 4 minutes behind the published schedule - that is if they are ""on time"". More often than not, there are ""significant delays"" which literally happens on a daily basis. These ""significant delays"" would not be much of an issue if BART didn't run on a schedule that only has one train slithering by every 10 minutes. With the demand for public transportation the way it is, BART is already failing. Every single day during rush hour, people are left stranded on platforms, as train after train arrive and leave packed, usually 5 to 6 trains go by before they can find one to squeeze themselves onto. This is not the kind of service passengers should expect, especially with the current ticket prices. And with the demand increasing, there is no way BART, in the way it is run now, will possibly cope.A large part of BART's failure is down to its employees. There is too high of a reliance on a group of individuals who have extremely low standards when it comes to quality of service, and a very high level of entitlement when it comes to pay and benefits for their shoddy work. Strikes and complete shutdowns are pretty much expected every few months, and the entire Bay Area suffers because of these selfish individuals.At a time when the population of the Bay Area is increasing every month, radical change is much needed for BART. Huge investments in its infrastructure is needed to create a transportation system that can actually sustain the increased traffic in the Bay Area. As the centre for technological advancement, BART should be moving away from its reliance on manpower and towards autonomy. The vast majority of the functions performed by its employees can be replaced by autonomous systems, which will perform better and complain less.It is a real shame that in an area as great as the Bay Area, transportation is a choice between hours stuck in traffic, and a unreliable, disgusting relic that has no business operating in this century."
112,3,"Jul 20, 2016","Public transportation in the Bay Area is really pathetic. The big tech company buses are great for workers,but further exacerbate the traffic congestion and inequality. Limited service at few locations are bad enough,but the complete lack of trains going through the Bay Area loop hurt everyone. For all the innovation happening here, the industry is complacent about this problem. The government agencies such as BART are also to blame. I really want to take public transportation to avoid hellish traffic and to be environmentally friendly. However, the system makes this nearly impossible to accomplish unless one has 2-3 hours to waste each direction."

I looked up and stairs are blocked by drug dealers, someone sitting down with bags, then a guy upset I didn't use the other half of the stairs (I left the wider path to a guy going up with crutches)At this point I just feel bad for BART and think maybe they have thrown in the towel during COVID (even though this experience is not too different than pre-corona).

116,2,"May 20, 2019","I depended on BART when I visited the area, and I have plenty of positive things to say about the system. It goes between the airport to the downtown area and across the bay quite directly, and the convergence of lines around the city center makes it easy to get a train there. The light rail (I'm just reviewing the whole transit system) goes straight to the baseball stadium, but nowhere near the Golden Gate bridge (i.e. the thing you came to SF for). There's also this weird mix of light rail and underground going on where the same train will go in and out of tunnels; a streetcar becomes a subway and then goes back again. I found it easy to get a card at the airport, and the costs have not been bad. The trains don't run frequently enough at off hours, and everything is on the dated side.Yelp reviews aren't really the place for social commentary, but without making any statement on the details of San Fransisco politics and policy (because I don't know enough), I can only say that whatever they are doing for the city's homeless population is not working. I was greeted on my first train by someone loudly threatening to kill whoever they were talking on the phone with, and subsequently encountered several more people who were clearly struggling in life. The police were reasonably caring in handling a homeless gentleman with an apparent case of cellulitis who troubled the passengers with his behavior, but no one stopped a passenger from drinking root beer laced with whiskey out of a can. DC's public transit system, where I'm from, is superficially similar, but it is literally a news story every time someone gets caught with food or drink on a train. This sort of behavior is not normal in any city I've visited on either side of the world, but it is the stereotype that all of us non-locals think of when they think of San Francisco, and the stereotype appears to be true. Given how filthy rich the city is, you'd think they could do better at taking care of their transit system and their people."

Believing that it was just because of BART being unsteady, I ignored it. As the train continued on and we were arriving at the Montgomery Station, I felt another step on my foot, but this time it felt intentional.I turned around to see who might have accidentally stepped on me, to which it appeared to be the same woman who told me to turn down my music. I then asked this ""BART employee"" what her problem was, to which she got really upset/loud and said, ""IF YOU WANNA LISTEN TO YOUR MUSIC, GET SOME 'BEAT' HEADPHONES...""  I told her that because BART is so loud, I couldn't hear/understand how loud my music might have been and that if she had that much of an issue with my music volume, she could/should of, moved to a different area of the train.As we stopped at the Montgomery Station, she proceeded to shout out loud so that the whole train would pay attention, that she ""asked"" me if I could turn my music down. However, this was false. I simply reminded her that, ""you didn't ask me anything, you demanded. But you could have asked politely."" As the BART doors opened and everyone was exiting, I got a handful of praises /acknowledgments from other by-standers who witnessed everything that took place (thanks yall).I say all this to say that the lack of human to human contact through verbally present communication, is lost. I'm a native to the Bay Area and the lack of humanity here is becoming extinct. All I'm saying is just be more mindful/kind to people and communicate to others how you'd want to be communicated to in return.

Avoid Bart. It's nasty anyways and also unsafe (lice and bedbugs). Barf agents also will demand your ticket and tell you that your ticket didn't have enough $$ on it as the machines are worn out and covered with duct tape and pressure you for some cash.

Confusing ticket terminals. They were a tad confusing for me to use. I wish I could just tell the system where I am and where I'm going instead of cross-referencing a wall chart, then paying.2. Where am I? I think I'm going deaf, since at each stop I wasn't totally clear on where we were - and signage wasn't particularly consistent. On one occasion, we stopped at a station and had NO IDEA where we were.

I can never rely on the system to run on time. This is a result of zero planning by the BART board and management. Old equipment, aging stations with continuous multiple escalators out of service. Hundreds of thousands of annoyed passengers coping with daily schedule delays. It's the big turd in the Bay Area punchbowl. The Bay Area is a boom region. Everyone knows this!!! It came roaring back from the recession and BART didn't bother to notice. I do not care if the timing was bad or the recession hampered an upgrade. There is NO excuse for this. You want people not to drive? Give them a reason! Learn to plan! It's your job!Oh and let's not forget that this hulking pile of mechanical junk has tripled in cost to passengers over the past few years with NO added service or upgrades. I'm sure there must be an ""I hate BART"" movement. I am joining it today."

On top of that, I got mites from riding Bart one time--believe it happened when I was wearing a tank top and sweater and sat in a nasty seat.  Took me a month to get rid of the mites and had to deep clean my entire house daily.  It was a lot of work!  It's definitely a health and hygiene hazards to the public.

They post a chart on the wall to help you locate your final destination and pay the corresponding fare.  We waited in line ten minutes to purchase our tickets because the people in front of us were confused about the ticket buying process.  It's definitely not intuitive.  If you pay with a $20 bill, the ticket machine assumes that you want to buy a $20 ticket.  If you want one for a smaller dollar amount you have to subtract value from your $20 ticket in $1 increments.I appreciate BART for getting us from the airport to the burbs in a reasonable amount of time.  That's about all the praise I can muster up though.We rode one of the 1970s era trains that looks like a silver sock puppet with racing stripes.  The ride was rough and incredibly loud.  Actually, loud isn't even the word to describe the grating shriek of metal on metal--it was almost demonic.  I'm prone to motion sickness so being jostled around for much of the ride made me feel queasy too.The main reason I didn't enjoy my ride on BART is because the train car and track didn't seem designed for one another and it made for an uncomfortable ride.

142,4,"Aug 5, 2017","Tremendous and great way to get to the airport. Cheap and easy. I wish our city, the 5th largest, had a better transit system."
143,1,"Nov 19, 2018","The reason why most companies would go online is for convenience and security reasons. Bart online payment Services is a headache. You make a payment hoping to use the clipper card, bart system tells you:""-        If you place your order by 6 p.m., you can usually pick up your value in the next 1 to 2 days. -        If you are picking up your value on a bus or a Muni light-rail vehicle, please allow up to 5 days.-        If you set up Autoload using a bank account as your payment method, please allow an additional 10 days for value to first be available.

144,2,"Mar 15, 2016","It'll get you from A to B, and the trains arent any dirtier than the next city's trains BUT I am not a fan of using BART.Instead of a one price fits all system like they have in New York ($2.50 per way) or LA ($1.75 per way) you have to waste time calculating how much YOUR stop will cost. For me to get from the East Bay (Dublin/Pleasanton) into SF it costs me $5.50. Way too expensive.It feels like they purposely make the pricing system complex so that you leave the system with  unused money on your ticket. The tickets are paper so they're harder to maintain and their ticket machines are nowhere near as user friendly as other machines.Parking at a station? Good luck figuring out how to pay. BART keeps parking machines inside the turnstiles but change machines outside the turnstiles... yet their parking machines are cash only.I wouldn't complain so much about a Public system but at $11 per round trip I expect a better experience."

Three days latter, I received an EZ Rider parking hangtag in the mail. Now I can just walk through the entry fare gates, simply tag my Clipper card at a Parking Validation Machine, and the daily parking fee will be deducted from my BART parking account. I'm only charged for the days I park at any BART Station. Now I don't have to remember my parking space number and since Parking Validation Machines only take cash, the EZ makes it a breeze!"
148,1,"Dec 11, 2018","Where to start... Well let's start with being stuck at 19th St. station due to a missed connection/transfer (BART mistiming), and a train that just did not f****** show up.Not to mention there is only set of rail track, so you can forget it if there is a maintenance requirement. Everything stops, usually at the height of rush hour because the system handle the ridership capacity.Public is supposed to keep my car off the freeway, but it does the opposite. It makes me want to add my car to the Bay Area commute. Just a real sh**** system."
149,2,"Jan 21, 2018","BART is in serious need of renovation.  Tracks/trains are unbelievably noisy and usually dirty. For a major city's public transportation, it ranks below standard or acceptable.  In addition the timing of the Oakland airport connector to BART is terrible.  Missed BART by 1 min countless times and the next train is a 20 min wait. Disappointing."
150,1,"Sep 17, 2017","I grew up taking BART and while it was always loud and dirty, it has gotten to a point where it is essentially unusable. Everyone already knows about the complete lack of security in the stations or on the trains, the fake security cameras which were only recently replaced with real ones, the incredible mismanagement of funds leading to janitors sleeping in utility closets to rack up $250k+ salaries, a new station that took over 18 years to plan and open, tracks that could potentially bend in high heat, and stations covered in urine and feces. So I don't even need to talk about that.But on top of the epic (almost comical level of) newsworthy problems leading to this case study of a poor transit system is a complete lack of acknowledgement by BART. I was personally on a train recently in which 5 teenagers roamed through and threatened to rob several passengers, ending in the group chasing someone off the train into the Lake Merritt station to get his wallet. I reported this to BART and got the most irresponsible response. Instead of acknowledging the problem, asking what date and time it happened so they could potentially look at the security camera footage, or any more details about the crime, they just deflected blame. They told me it was likely just a copycat crime similar to Coliseum robbery and that they can't have security everywhere. And that was it. No wonder nothing gets better on BART if they can't admit there is a problem and refuse to do anything even when a crime is reported.Last week I walked up the stairs at Civic Center station and passed a group of about 10 people smoking crack pipes, shooting up and drinking alcohol on the steps. As I exited the station I saw SFPD and told them what I just experienced. The officer laughed and said that was BART's problem. Well BART doesn't think it's their problem either. Welcome to Hamsterdam."
151,1,"Dec 9, 2014","Recently my usual station began charging to park, one of the last to do so. I forgot to pay for my spot this morning (I've been lazy, haven't got the EZRider pass yet).  I called a friend who was actually willing to go pay my $1, providing the Station Attendant would let him in the fare gate soley for this purpose (it's about a ten foot walk past the gate, in full view of the attendant.)  He was let in and my spot did get paid for, but not without a scolding and a stern ""Don't expect us to let you do that again.""My God, Bart employees love to be hated."
152,3,"Apr 11, 2006","I take Bart to work everyday and most of the time it is just a way to get to and from work, where I slip into anonymity and hope that stinky fat guy doesn't sit next to me.  I try to get a window seat so I can curl up with my music and ignore the rest of the world for my 45 minute ride.  Most of the time I can do this.    I do think the fares are getting out of hand.  Don't get me started on employee benfits or salaries.Then there are the Bart From Hell days.  We've all been a victim, so no need to write them all out here...My real complaints, I think, are toward Other RidersYou who bring 6, 7, 8 pieces of luggage, throw it all over the floor and expect us to happily trip over all of it to get on and off the train.You who selfishly yap on your cell phones, not realizing that We All Can Hear You and yes, we are very interested in what your boyfriend did to you last night...You who lay across two seats sleeping.You who stand on the left side of the escalator - you realize, of course, this is the ""walking side""  And finally, the Whole Carload of people, on my last day of work before maternity leave.  You all raised your newspapers or quickly shut your eyes as I boarded - quite obviously 9 months pregnant.  You all made me stand, in tears, for 45 minutes."

154,1,"Jul 23, 2017","So expensive, so dirty, so old, so many crazy people. Expect to pay $20 round trip going anywhere. They totally missed the point of public transportation which is supposed to be value. Pay luxury price to ride and an old, noisy, smelly, pos horribly outdated system and hope that you're not in the same cart as the crazy drugged up transient trying to harass you for money. I had cash to give ya, but I spent it on all BART. Truly displays the decline of society"
155,4,"Sep 25, 2015","Although many trains run on similar tracks, which can be confusing to visitors, the public train system is great for getting around the Bay area without the need for a car.  I can't imagine going to all the places that we went in three days while driving and trying to park.  I love the trains and think they are more convenient than trying to drive around SF and oakland.  I gave 4 stars because of the loud noise while going through tunnels,  the inconsistent temperature of the trains and the confusing ticket-buying machines."
156,1,"May 21, 2019","Today I had the god awful experience taking BART. Went to spend the day to join my daughter at the SFO Airport. After spending $46.20 for two round trip tickets from Orinda (including parking). We were joined by two males who (I am sure paid for tickets) that decided to do a little heroin. They took it out and decided to smoke it rather then shoot it up (kindly not leaving any needle behind.) They both were very high and both nodded off into a drug state at the the same time. Called the BART Police who were really not sounding very interested in getting involved. I told them what train we were on and they said OK. The two gentlemen woke up in San Bruno and decided to get off the train. I called BART dispatch back and advised them and they hung up on me before I finished talking.On the way back we decided to stop in San Francisco to visit a friend to find out that there was $5 extra dollars for this privilege per ticket.  After walking over needles and the homeless and smelling the air full of urine. I attempted to get clarification from a BART employee in the booth regarding the $10 plus dollars deducted off the cards he told me to be quiet. NO CUSTOMER SERVICE SKILLS WHAT SO EVER. I added more money to one of the tickets. Since there no change machine working when I attempted to add more money to the second ticket I used a ATM card the machine took the ticket that has $1.15 left on it and charged $24.15 to a new BART card and would not provide a reciept.Got on train sat in what felt like a wet seat, to no surprise since there are no bathrooms to be heard of someone just probably pissed their pants. Get back to Orinda and one ticket goes through and the other one still says it does not have enough cash on it even though I added cash on it at Montgomery.Station agent at Orinda was only person with any common sense he took tickets could see I put money on both tickets and let us go, as if to say yea yea I know this system is totally messed up, I know. WORSE TRAIN SYSTEM IN THE WORLD BE FAR!!!"
157,4,"Sep 21, 2016","This review is dedicated to my ACRONYM twin in Tampa: Chris W.A brief text history between myself & Chris prior to leaving for SF (not verbatim but in general):Me: ""Hey, how are you getting to the hotel? Are you taking Uber or the BART?""C: ""I'm taking an Uber.""Me: ""Yeah, me too!""In summary, we were both too chicken to try public transit in a city we weren't familiar with. Yes, I'll admit it: I scoured YouTube on the 'how to' vids and any kind of tips I could find in Reddit or wherever I could find them. I analyzed and reanalyzed the maps and broke everything down into charts, graphs, and color codes. I didn't want to take an Uber. I wanted to experience the BART. When I landed at the airport, I felt empowered. I was gonna DO THIS. I asked an airport employee where I should start and she was kind enough to take me pretty much all the way to the starting connection. I walked up to the machine and purchased my ticket. I was almost there. Sweating... such an intense moment. I saw other people who were standing around confused at what to do. In my mind I was like, ""HA! I watched YouTube how to's! I studied!"" I was so excited I had to remember to break away from it to pay attention as to which train was the one I needed to take. I got on, luggage and all... and heard the boarding signal. Within a matter of minutes, the train was moving. At each stop I looked at my trusty BART app and watched which stops were which so I could get a better idea of how fast we were going and of course, see where I was at so I wouldn't miss my stop. I did enjoy all the great scenery on the trip too so aside from the smooth ride, I got to take in a few pics & vids. It really wasn't all that bad. I got out about a block (more or less) from the Galleria Park Hotel and with a little more guidance from a local as to where the hotel was at, made it in no time. In conclusion, I'm a fan and Chris, if we ever meet in SF again, you are taking the BART!  =^^="
160,1,"Mar 22, 2016","Well, I have to give it a 1 out of 5 star rating. Not until Bart (or other Bay Area public transit) can come up with a way to let commuters commute into the city in less than 30 mins, I won't give my endorsement.Expected Time of Arrival:By Rapid or Express train: From Union City to Montgomery: 22 mins (as opposed to 42 currently + 15-20 mins of delay)From Fremont to Montgomery: 27 mins (as opposed to 47 currently + 15-20 mins of delay) There is no point of stopping after Bay Fair. The train in rush hour is virtually full with no more seats and standing room.Express: stop at warm spring, fremont, union city, bay fair.Rapid: all the stops aforementioned, and south Hayward, Hayward, and San Leandro, and coliseum.Does it make sense? New York Metro has rapid and express trains. Why can't Bart have it?"

163,2,"Feb 6, 2020","Ugh. Why is every experience a challenge?  The trains are old with zero ventilation. They do not run frequently enough for the demand. I've only been using BART for two months but already leaning towards driving to work which would be faster, more comfortable and about the same cost. Someone please fix this failed system as I'd rather not continue to the carbon footprint because they fail."
164,5,"Oct 2, 2011","BART is one of the fastest ways to get around here in the Bay Area.They are in a process of figuring out how to completely renovate and upgrade their current fleet of trains. Renovating and upgrading their trains will cost them a lot of money. BART trains had carpeted floors on every trains before, but now most of the trains in the fleet are receiving a facelift. The floors will make it easier for the janitorial staff to clean up!I take BART because: with the current gas prices and bridge toll rates, I'd use public transportation as an environmental friendly alternative. I can sit back, relax, listen to music, surf the web on an iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, read a book, magazine, newspaper or finish my homework and study for a test.I don't have to worry about having both hands on the steering wheel and keeping my eyes on the road. Additionally, I can go worry free without piddling around for spare change to pay the bridge toll.I can use either a BART Ticket or a MUNI Adult Monthly Fast Pass for BART travels between Balboa Park and Embarcadero Stations in San Francisco.BART is a fast and an environmental friendly option, go give it a try!"
165,5,"Apr 20, 2011","I've taken BART for 10 years and it is the transit system I use as an alternative to get around. Obviously, many people get around via BART because it's fast. Whether you are travelling through the city or across the bay, BART gets you there. Sure, the fares are a bit expensive now but it's more important to know that BART is one of the transit systems you can count on to you get you to school, work, and anywhere for any purpose."

Security DRIVING ROUND AND ROUND ON EACH FLOOR on a multi-level parking structure does absolutely no good if your low life piece of shit criminal is on another floor breaking into cars... I think cameras on every floor at different areas of each floor with someone monitoring the cameras would be a much more effective way of securing a multi-level parking structure..  Do yourself a favor and find a good neighborhood to park in and take a Uber/Lyft into the city.  However, if you do choose to ride the BART be sure to bring a nose plug unless you like the smell of urine."
168,1,"Jul 26, 2017","Wow...we took our family on a few day trips to Oakland and Palo Alto.  We did not realize the gangs of thugs that routinely target unsuspecting families on these trains.

We will never visit the Bay Area again!"
169,1,"Sep 28, 2016","I have been a daily Bart commuter for 15 years. Service has plummeted since 2011. The trains are horribly overcrowded these days. Half the time the AC is broken or underperforming which combined with too many people makes them hot to the point of being sweaty. The train drivers are all brakes or all gas pedal you need a 3 point safety harness to stand up, which you will be doing. Now comes a half baked idea to remove seats because they think you can pack more people in. Failed idea, not enough overhead bars to hold on. These trains hold less people. Bart is a high speed commuter train not a low speed urban train where rides are short. It's physically a work out to stand up on one of these bucking beasts for 40 minutes. By 7pm Bart is running on a 20 minute cycle between the city and east bay which is too long between trains I hate Bart"

176,1,"Aug 30, 2018",I don't understand why such a big and prosperous city has such a bad public transportation system. Please learn from Japan.
177,4,"Feb 21, 2017","Compared to other public transportation services in the United States, BART is above average. It services and passes through the majority of the major cities and places in the Bay Area region. BART is also expanding further in the South Bay region, specifically in Warm Springs, Milpitas, and San Jose. Some trains are older with ragged seats and dirty floors. Nonetheless, the passenger experience isn't bad at all. Overall, the trains are maintained well. Cyclists have designated trains. For out-of-towners visiting the Bay Area, BART is easy to use with user-friendly maps and routes. However, compared to public transportations in other countries, BART can use with renovations and improvements. For example, Bangkok's BTS Skytrain can serve as a useful model for BART."

180,4,"Apr 9, 2016","Even though the BART might not always been the fanciest form of travel, I am envious of such a convenient form of transportation throughout San Fransisco, Oakland and Berkeley. The BART is efficient, although sometimes there are delays and certain lines are closed, you'll find various options to get you to your final destination posted along the scrolling video screens by the tracks. Most stations have stairs and escalator options, although I noticed escalators don't always go in the same direction: you might only find a down escalator at one stop but an up escalator at another. This could be a hindering factor for bike users (of which there are plenty that use BART to get to another biking destination!)   Most stops are in very convenient locations throughout San Fransisco and Berkeley, you'll be a short walk from an ideal tourist spot. Also, you can get to and from the San Fransisco or Oakland airports using the Bart. As a new BART user, here are some helpful tips for new users: tickets are purchased through monitors, swipe your card and than you'll be prompted with pricing options. Find where you're heading (usually posted directly next to each monitor, both one way and round trip prices) and select the exact amount you need. Unfortunately, the system always prompts you to add $20.00 to your card, but you can change that amount if needed. AND if you don't put enough money on your card, no worries, you can add more once you reach your destination station. Take note: if you're trying to purchase multiple cards for multiple rides, select that option first before applying funds. If you're unsure of what to do, ask for help! There are BART employees are each station, just look for the box. Once you purchase your card {great value too BTW}, enter the gate and head down to the tracks. Make sure you're heading in the right direction--there are two sets of tracks! East Bay is towards Berkeley (North), while the other direction is towards San Fransisco Airport (South). Watch the monitors for exact time of car arrival and how many cars (this lets you know how far down you can stand). Seating and standing (with holders) available once you enter the car. Stations are called out over the speakers pre-arrival and there's a map on the wall of each car."
181,4,"Jun 2, 2017","If there is no delay and no strike, BART is a convenient way to commute between the East Bay and the city and even OAK, SFO.  Compared to paying for the expensive parking in the city, BART is more affordable.  If BART issues monthly passes, it will be even better.  If you use Clipper Card for BART and connecting other public transportations in the Bay Area within a time limit, there is a discount of 25-50 cents.During commute hours, BART is pretty crowded."
182,1,"Jul 25, 2018","The most dysfunctional, mismanaged and incompetent organization in North America. The cars are filthy, they smell, and the BART police are never seen. During the day there are beggars going through the trains asking for money. The track system is a mess and they are the highest paid transit workers in the US. And now we have three murders in five days. All they talk about is extensions and they can't even manage what they have now. The organization should be taken over by the NTSB until the problems are fixed."
183,1,"Aug 16, 2014","What an amazingly mis-managed organization. Tonight we took BART to the city rather than drive. What mistake. We boarded in Fremont. At the second stop, South Hayward, a passenger got on our car and went to the front of the car. He then announced he was homeless and would be taking collections as he passed through the car. We got off at Civic in SF. The stench of urine is almost over powering. The return wasn't much better. We boarded at Embarcadero. Within minutes a woman is going through the car carrying a sign saying she is homeless and needs money. She is carrying a baby in a front carrier. When she gets close to us we see the ""baby"" is actually a plastic doll. She stops at each row and stares at people. When they don't give her any money she says something in a foreign language. I've been in the NYC subway and other US transit systems. The BART trains are filthy, the stations smell of urine, there is no security to be seen- anywhere. This has to be the worst mass transit system in North America."

A homeless woman actually had the audacity to pull down her pants and piss inside a BART train with passenger inside to see.  As if it wasn't bad enough an experience as it is.  This is beyond ridiculous.  BART needs to put an end to it mess.  These BART cops are never around when you need them.

They stink of urine and feces.Hire elevator attendants to stop people from peeing and pooping in the elevators. If you can't do that, have maintence people available to clean the elevators several times a day.When BART starts paying attention to what is really important, I might consider using it. As it is now, I refuse to such a disgusting system."

Waiting for cabs that never show up? Fuggetaboutit. Note: you must connect through Coliseum Station, there is no street access otherwise.The cable pulled train cars run every five minutes from eight in the morning, until eight at night, and at longer intervals from 5am to 8am and 8pm to midnight.The cost from Coliseum Station to OAK is six bucks."

Both new and old trains. The elevators are constantly out and the 1 escalator is always seeming to go the  wrong direction for you when you have luggage. The tickets machines constantly out of service, making long lines. And the BART agents are on the whole rude and unhelpful. I watched 15 people in a span of 20 min jump or push thru gates without paying all the while the agents watch them. Trains run with such long intervals in between it takes a long time to get to your destination especially on weekends. All in all the system is a failure in comparison to others."
192,1,"Aug 5, 2018","Probably the Nation's worst system. The train schedule is horrible on evenings and weekends, leaving every 20 minutes in many places. The escalators never function and you have to drag your luggage up and down the stopped escalator or stairs. The elevators were out today. The train was under maintenance on West Oakland from SFO but of course no mention was made of this so you could actually choose to take a shuttle or taxi. Instead they tell you at West Oakland to exit the train for buses to the 19th station where there are no working escalators or elevators. Such a terrible crappy system that is more expensive than the DC Metro or NY Subway and much dirtier, louder and inefficient. And of course, BART officials do nothing to improve it despite raising fares and taxes which obviously don't go to improving the system. What an embarrassment for the Bay Area."

Stop pan handling on BART and pretending it's for a charity, for your school, for a sports program, etc. If it was truly for one of these programs there would be an option to donate online that you would happily tell us all about- if the money was really for anything legit.Frankly I don't care what it's really for. Drugs, liquor, or even food. Cuz once you try to con me, I don't care anymore.And to those who give these people $$$ STOP! Please tell me you're really not that dumb? I mean really, have you looked at the ""paper work"" they're carrying? Oh, they didn't have any paper work? They left it at home? It's on notebook paper.There are typos? The wording includes slang and ""big"" words used out of context or just incorrectly?My favorite of these scam artists is a young, very good looking, African American Man who asks for a donation of a dollar for a youth organization he's clean cut, articulate, claims a good cause, and it's only a dollar. Only problem? Not only. Does his organization not exist, but it changes names constantly. Sometimes from car to car, or train to train.For those of you who are not familiar with how program donations work these days remember these basics..1. Any non profit seeking donations will provide volunteers (or those employed to raise money) with paper work, hand outs etc that detail who they are, what they do, all contact info, and how to go about making a donation.2. A receipt would be given or atleast offered for every donation no matter the size.3. Since cash donations are rare and sometimes people can't afford to that day but maybe would later, their would be info of how to donate on line, or at a later date.Those 3 things are absolutes. If any one of the 3 is missing then you're dealing with an amateur con artist who's to stupid and/or lazy to even con you well. Also just because a kid is cute doesn't mean that the money he/she is conning out of you is even going to them. More likely a parent put them up to it. Sadly I recently was sitting in the last seat on a 10 car train. My car was empty except an older man drinking a beer in a brown bag. I had my head phones in my ear but not on. Two kids (they looked @ 5 and 8 years old) came back with a fish bowl and plastic bag of snickers bars. They told their Dad they only sold 5. Their Dad said ""Well I guess $3 each is too much, next train tell em 2 bucks or 2 for $3""."

196,4,"Jun 25, 2013","I'm not used to public transportation.  I've never been on a train, I've never taken the Metro, I've only used a bus a few times in my life (always with someone).  So I found the system a little confusing.  My mantra from that Hilary Duff movie, ""friends don't let friends take public transportation"" doesn't apply here.  Now i realized that there are really only 2 paths I had to concentrate on and it just goes back and forth.  I looked on the map and counted how many stops I needed to get to where I wanted to go.  I asked a million people.  I'm freaked at the thought of getting lost so I made sure over and over again.  But then I realized, THERE ARE SIGNS THAT TELL ME WHERE I AM.  Haha I must have been so annoying.  A thank you to all the helpful locals that were not annoyed when I berated them with questions.  A few tips:-Make sure to check where you need to go and if you're on the right route.-Don't lose your ticket! (happened to me) You need it to get out of there-Don't stand too close to the doors or you'll get yelled at over the intercom by the driver.-Make sure you have enough money on your ticket so you don't have to constantly go back to those machines and wait in line to put more money on it.People watching!  Funny mexican lady that started crying and wailing in spanish asking why the train wasn't moving, to the creepy homeless man with the suspicious looking box...is that your home I wonder?La needs better public transport..."
197,5,"Oct 14, 2010","I had a long time love-hate relationship with the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system but I didn't know how good I had it!  I'm so sorry, BART!  BART, you are the most used, convenient and reliable rapid transit system in the West Coast for a reason - bar none!MOST USED:Approximately 350,000 passengers ride BART every week, making it the fifth-busiest rapid transit system in the United States!  This is almost 200,000 more passengers than those that ride the Los Angeles County Metro Rail Red and Purple Line combined!  (Los Angeles and Orange County really needs to get with the program when it comes to use and priority it puts on public transportation, but we all know that!)  CONVENIENT:BART runs from 4a.m. to midnight and arrives at its destination about every 15 minutes!  And each stop it makes in-between is no more than two minutes!  BART continues to use its resources to improve the quality of the system and its ability to serve the public transportation needs. Some modernizations include major overhauls of the stations and extensions to the area covered by the BART lines.RELIABLE:BART has reportedly one of the highest on-time performance records in the nation.  Unanticipated delays, however, occasionally do happen.  Riders can learn about them by going directly to their website: www.bart.gov real time arrivals and learn of any delays.  Real time arrivals and trip planners can even be uploaded onto many mobile devices like the iPhone and the Android.  OTHER BENEFITS:What about time and cost savings to us and public safety (riding the train is reportedly 80% safer than riding in an automobile)?  If more people rode BART, this could significantly reduce the amount of air pollution and gas emissions to the San Francisco Bay Area region.  There could be broader benefits, if more people in our state learned to become more energy independent.  We could see a real reduction on reliance on foreign oil!I lived in San Francisco for four years, 1999 to 2003, and worked at the Civic Center.  I usually took the Dublin/Pleasanton - Daly City/Millbrae line to take me all over the East Bay and South San Francisco for both personal and business purposes.BART took me to our satellite offices throughout the East Bay, shopping at Union Square, dinner and drinks at the Embarcadero, lunch in the Mission District, to and from Oakland International Airport (OAK), Giants games, Golden State Warrior games, and visiting girlfriends in Daly City, Fruitvale and Hayward!  (Not all during the same time period.  That would be wrong!)Back then, major airlines like Southwest and American Airlines did not fly from Los Angeles into San Francisco International Airport (SFO).  Moreover, BART had not extended its lines to connect to the airport terminal.  Now, it is the city's major airport/public transit connector.  An already great rapid transit system became much more convenient and accessible after I moved away! I absolutely love BART!  Now, what's your excuse not to love it too?"
200,2,"Jul 16, 2017","When BART works it is great. When it doesn't, which is about 50% of the time, it ruins days, jobs, plans, appointments, etc. Real Time departures go from 5 mins to 20 mins within all too often. Equipment and train malfunctions. Police actions because, well, our society is violent. The people vote for BART to have more money to fix problems and (crickets). BART management is poor at best. High pay, no results.You CANNOT just wait until everything falls apart until you decide to fix the problems.Seems the American Way in a nutshell. Bloated and top heavy while the infrastructure collapses.The garbage at the 17th St entry to 19th St station is awful. It has been there for WEEKS. Yes, people do not respect their communities."
201,2,"Jul 16, 2013","I've been taking BART for years to go shopping, to job interviews and to work and it's usually been easy breezy, though yes, gross!  *Shudders at the cloth seats.*  But of course through the years, just like a semi tainted relationship, the bad qualities in BART have shown through a little more once the ""honeymoon phase"" wore off.  Escalators are always broken even just after being fixed, the trains get tore up even more (okay that's primarily the passengers' fault), the Spear Street entrance still isn't even opened back up yet, causing congestion when exiting the station while everyone's trying to get to the office!  Don't think that BART can help it, but besides the usual occasional homeless, crazy, drunk, or sketchy few that may be seen on BART occasionally, there's also from time to time solicitors..haven't seen that on Caltrain or Muni.  For the most part, the trains usually do run on time, up to every 15 minutes except for non-peak hours (after 8pm I believe on weekdays).  Another negative..let's not get started on the BART strike..I'm hoping that the union will come to an agreement before the deadline next month..though it's looking unlikely.  Living on the Peninsula, I do like Caltrain because it's clean and feels safer, but let's face it, Caltrain doesn't go to the FiDi, and taking Caltrain makes my trip longer.  BART is also more frequent.Step up a little BART & maybe we all will up a star or two!"
202,4,"Nov 1, 2009","You really don't appreciate it until you need it. The ""it"" is a reliable option to driving a mad/maddening two plus hour drive to traverse from the East to West Bay (or vice versa), due to the Bay Bridge closure. My BART memories: a) Riding from school to home weekdays from age 11 to 13. b) Touring the main computer center at Lake Merritt station. c) Riding from home to school and back in my higher education learning years (age 21 to 23). d) Riding to catch Warrior game (1989 earthquake) or Raider game. It's been over ten years since I've ridden BART and things have changed (missing side-way seats for bikers, extra grips for standing passengers, and, of course, higher fares), but it's something that many take for granted. The bridge closure resulted in a sharp increase in ridership and probably lower smog and pollution levels in the Bay Area. For the commuting work force, it has been a lifesaver. For me, I was able to catch the Warriors' home opener in a relatively painless manner, still getting home by 11 pm. In a nutshell, BART remains it!"

204,3,"May 29, 2009","Riding the BART has become a necessity for us East Bay members of the bridge and tunnel club. The seats smell, the carpets are stained, and every now and then the homeless give themselves pedi's on the seats. I'll stop bragging for a moment to mention though that the BART is punctual and the most stress-free transportation to the City. Still, with another fare hike coming up shortly and the fact that BART doesn't run pass midnight even on the weekends, I wonder that I am paying extra for? ( HINT: It not to steam clean the carpet, although I wish they would.) Last week, I caught the last train back to the East Bay at 12:15 am and found a group of teenagers expressing their discontent for the Oscar Grant shooting by taking down one of the hundreds of Adverts (that in theory reduce the cost to us riders by supplementing it with the Ad revenue) and making their own tribute. (See picture in photos.) With tensions still high and prices continuing to rise to use BART, I wonder how much more of will commuters put up with until BART runs itself into the ground? Time will tell, but personally, I'd like to see the government take it over and regulate it, so that it would become as nice and clean as the transportation they  have in Japan. That way, the seats would be steamed clean. ;-)"
205,3,"Jan 27, 2012","BART is pretty reliable and dependable - but it could do better.  I have used the public transit trains in Mexico City, Boston, New York, Paris, Madrid, Barcelona and Tokyo - to name a few.  They are all BETTER than BART for so many reasons - most other trains don't cost as much as BART, they run more frequently and they don't stop running at midnight so you're stuck on one side of the bay or the other like Cinderella in rags with a pumpkin and mice.If they could pull together a brand new train system after a devastating 1989 earthquake in Mexico City - and continue to expand the system - with clean cars and clean stations - why is it so difficult for BART to do the same?I give 3 stars because I'm glad it is here - we'd be lost without it.  Without BART and the bridges, it would take about 3 days by horse & carriage to get from SF to Oakland (that was less than 100 years ago!).  The people problems on BART are just a symptom of our culture - egocentrism over civility and manners.  The horrible dirty cars, bad schedules and noisiness are all BART issues.  Bay Area - we can do better!"
206,4,"Sep 5, 2008","Without you BART, I'd be stuck way, way, way out in the East Bay.  I'm talking cherry orchards ""way out"".  I just wanted to say thank you for all the times you've transported me safely to and fro.  I don't use you for business but strictly for pleasure.  The ride to is always the longest and the ride back is always eventful.  I can't tell you half the crazy sloshed up conversations I've held with other stumbling passengers, on the way home.  You probably don't want to know.  I'm not even sure I wanted to know.Sure there are delays.  Isn't that just a part of life?I would like you to invest in some Woolite.

207,4,"Jan 29, 2007","Am I cheating or something?  There are so many reviews of BART stations, but why not one, all encompassing review of BART itself?  I mean, the actual train does not change from station to station.  As far as I'm concerned, it smells, feels and looks the same from Millbrae to Pleasanton (with the exception of riders who come and go).I like BART.  Yes, sometimes it smells like someone snuck a cat on and let it use the train as a litter box, and sometimes it is painfully delayed.  And yes, it's loud! (What did you say? I SAID, IT'S LOUD!!!).  And of course, there are those times when it's so crowded that you push and squeeze and abuse your bowels in hopes that passing wind may disperse the crowd that's smashing you.But overall, I commend BART.  It's easily accessible, more timely than MUNI, generally comfortable and always full of interesting people."

209,4,"Mar 29, 2010","I don't normally write about public transportation system, but I gotta write for this one. I was supposed to be driven to SFO by my friend, however, she had to go somewhere urgently, so she told I could take Bart to the airport. I was like, ""What? How long would that take?"", she said, ""at the most one hour."". Since I was early anyway, I thought, one hour in public transportation is not bad for $10, compared to $40 for a cab and takes you about 20minutes.Guess what? It actually costed me exactly $8.10 and no, it didn't take an hour, it took approximately 30minutes from Market St in downtown, so it's totally a great deal. Just make sure you chose the right train to SFO, cause not all trains make a stop there. The same train might go to Millbrae and another destination too. Remember to check the sign before you board the train."
212,3,"Dec 8, 2009","I hate shelling out lots of cash for cabs, so public transit is always a big win for me.This was my first time in San Francisco navigating BART without the aid of a local. From a newbie's perspective I found a few aspects of the system to be confusing and awkward. Before I get to my complaints, there is one thing that would be huge if they had in Chicago - signs indicating how far out trains are, I'm so jealous!1) The ticket machines. When I walked off the airport shuttle to get my ticket, I was not expecting the clusterfuck of 30+ people that met me when the doors opened. The instructions on the machine are vague and lacking, which I think is being kind. It is not clear for the newbie or the technologically illiterate, especially when you have 29ish cranky travelers breathing down your neck. Things picked up when they posted a woman in-between the two working machines to talk people through it. Also, three machines at the airport station hardly seemed like enough to handle the demand.2) Signage. Living in Chicago, I'm very dependent on our rail system (the El). What I love about the El is that there are plenty of system and line-specific maps on the platforms and on the trains. I didn't feel the same way about BART - more signs please!3) Stop announcements. Sorry, another Chicago comparison is coming. Back in the day, the El was like BART, the announcer told you what stop you were approaching; I hated it then and I hate it now. Do they send announcers to some sort of training so that everything they say sounds like the teacher from Peanuts? Both times I rode the train I had a hard time hearing the announcer, which forced me position myself in the event I needed to quickly dart off the train at each passing stop. Getting an automated recording, which tells you not only what stop you're approaching, but what the next stop is would be aces.4) Overall BART is very clean, but the upholstered, cushy seats skeved me out. I feel like you can never get those things really clean and I highly doubt they're steam cleaned or disinfected nightly, let alone monthly."
213,4,"Oct 13, 2008","If the BART were a woman, it'd be the most sought after lady in town. Fast and cheap. not even a night with Lindsay Lohan could compare to the deal you get from the BART.I heard about this thrifty form of transportation thanks to all the helpful SF yelpers in a talk thread I posted over the summer. Since then, I've taken it from SFO to Civic Center station for a mere 5 bucks; and on to other parts of town, it's cost pennies to the dollar.It's funny how I was warned to watch out for strange people and smells, but I've encountered no such things--um, yet.

217,4,"Oct 28, 2006","BART, n. Bay Area Rapid Transit.  A railroad, with 104 miles of track, in Northern California.  Rapid, in this case, stands for 80 mph.  Originally built to reduce traffic across the Bay Bridge and to facilitate commuting to downtown San Francisco, its immediate effect was to inspire a network of suburban office parks at stations throughout the system.  Walnut Creek, Concord, and Pleasanton enjoyed a renaissance due to this real estate boom.  In the past two weeks BART officials have discovered some operating money and have been actually cleaning the trains, leading to a pleasant riding experience.  You can still hear them a mile away, as those electric paddles, steel dragging on steel, scream like jet engines.   BART, v.

It's better for the environment, no worries about parking, or bridges tolls. BART has made it easier to get across the Bay, to get to SFO and Oakland airports, and eventually connecting to San Jose in the next few years.  It has made commuting and getting to different cities fast and convenient.  The Bay Area without BART would be like Hugh Hefner without Viagra, nobody's going no where.But the best part of BART is one particular employee.

220,2,"Jan 22, 2016","I use BART 4 times a week for my commute from Orinda-Montgomery and back. It can be smooth and tolerable, but when push comes to shove it's miserable. I can somewhat overlook the cleanliness (or lack thereof) of the stations and trains. Even though Montgomery is seriously extremely gross. They had people in hazmat suits clean the stairs at some point. That says all. What's more an issue is poor communication and the terrible design of the system itself. When something happens, the announcements through the intercom are barely audible because the quality is terrible. So you're left wondering what's going on and how long it'll take to resolve. Since everything from West Oakland through the later San Francisco stops is going through the same 2 tracks, any minor incident shuts the whole system down. It looks like they are updating the LED signs in the city, however signage at SFO are terrible. I have missed a late train due to insufficient signage, which made me arrive home 30 minutes later. I could have taken the train that was on the wrong side of the platform but it wasn't posted anywhere where that train would be headed. Station agents just shrug and didn't think it would be a big deal. A station like SFO that has many tourists should have proper signs. If the LEDs don't work, put temporary signs up, or stand on the platform and announce what's going on. It's not rocket science. Oh and another tidbit that drives me crazy are my fellow riders. People that stand right at the doors for 30-45 minutes straight should just move down the fricking aisle and not block the doors. Ridership 101 people."

I feel sorry for the little old ladies when I see them holding their noses. Person in the enclosed space is never there when you need help.1) The elevators have cameras why isn't there some one watching those cameras 24/7? If there was they could sent security right away; before, the floors gets wet or the elevators get abused by the homeless or?How can Bart let this happen to their customers. I wish there was a way I could make them buy me new batteries, because, almost every time I want to Adventure in SF they make me double back or forward."
234,2,"Dec 19, 2011",BAY AAAAAAAAAAREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAA....... TELL ME WHEN TO GO??????????? Bay Area Motherfucking Rapid Transit. Public transportation? HAHAHAH. Oh you poor San Franciscoians. It's alright. It goes straight from the airport to whatever destination you want and it's very affordable. The only thing I didn't like bout the BART is the fact that it reeked of a Medicinal smell. It smelled like a Hospital bed and that just kinda puts me off. The seats were dirty and there is trash everywhere.  FYI. A lot of people take the Bart... Go Stupid. Dum Dum.
237,2,"Mar 29, 2019","BART gets you to where you need to go (unless the station is closed cause another guy got stabbed) and it's relatively poop and pee free depending on the hours you ride. After 9PM, the hobos need a place to sleep so they use the BART trains. The entire time I've rode BART for two years, I've seen police officers on the train a handful of times, and even they won't sit down."
238,3,"Oct 11, 2016","Grateful for BART, but be prepared to give yourself a LOT of time in case something happens. I gave myself a hour to get from Balboa Park Station to Downtown Berkeley and got a really slow train driver who caused me to be late to take the Berkeley shuttle. From now on, I will give them 1 hour and 15 minutes to 1 hour and 30 minutes."
239,2,"Jul 10, 2015","I have mixed feelings about the BART, which I think just about everyone can agree with.  I will break this down from two viewpoints, and tell you how I arrived at my conclusion. Viewpoint #1- Lived in California their entire life, with a few trips to NYC, LA, and maybe London once.  I would say this person's name is John.  He loves the BART for its convenience and value.  It's the easiest way to get around - a good alternative to driving, and faster.  Usually reliable and usually clean, the BART provides good service for a wide area around the Bay.   He wishes it ran past midnight, but he's generally happy with the overall value proposition, all things considered. Viewpoint #2 - Grew up on the East Coast, near Boston and New York at separate times, and then lived in Asia for years, hitting the major metropolises and also visiting major cities in Europe and the Middle East.  So, even being as generous as possible, I can give BART a maximum of 2 stars.  First off, you need ear plugs when you're riding.  I've read it can spike over 100dBs at certain times under the bay, which is unacceptable for everyday riders to endure that.   Next, the stations and trains are not that dirty, but they're not clean either.   Tokyo and Seoul take the crown in that category.  For speed, BART is slower yet again, because there are constant delays and breakdowns.  How about having to transfer to another train when going from Berkeley to San Francisco?  This would be acceptable in a network like Seoul or Tokyo, but with 4 lines, no.  Just, no.BART fails in my eyes simply because of the network.   Seoul, Tokyo, Singapore, Hong Kong... I could go on - they all have extensive networks that provide incredible city coverage.  It's not just the coverage, however, because those places all have more people.  Would you guess that the BART is the most expensive out of all of them?  Singapore's minimum fare is under $1.  Seoul is right around there as well.  I can't expect round-the-clock service, but even my minimum expectations are not met on mass transit in San Francisco (bus, muni...also looking at you).  Yes, it's better than some other places I've been (Ghana, Vietnam, Myanmar, Laos), but to be such a great place to live and have this as a huge negative is disappointing.  The thing is, I don't see it getting better anytime soon."
240,3,"Aug 29, 2006","After spending 29 years living in the city, it seems like I just started taking the BART more often now!  Sure, I've taken the BART before, but now I actually have a high value BART pass in my wallet for those random moments when I'll be BARTing in around the Bay.  And you can't help but love that BART will take you to SFO and OAK airports now!  How sweet is that?!  One would wonder how did we ever survive w/o BART to the airports before?  Did we all rely on Super Shuttle before?  Heavens no!  I love that I can go to work, and head straight to the airport after work to begin my little adventure.  And then from the airport and straight back to work, can't beat that!And sure, it can take awhile, but it'll get you there.  And the seats are okay, sometimes you gotta wonder about the stains and what not.  And safety wise, it's okay. I've heard my share of horror stories on BART, but overall, it'll work for me.  BART has become my newfound friend this year."
241,4,"Jul 13, 2015","Yes it's outdated looking and yes it'd dirty, but it's a quarter of the price compared to a cab and, let's be honest. It's really stinking' fun to ride! Every time the Bart races into a tunnel, I'm tempted to throw my hands in the air and scream like a kid on a roller coaster. Here's a piece of information I wish I'd known sooner though - the Bart does not operate all night! I used to ride the light rail in Minneapolis, MN (which runs 24-7) on a regular basis, so I assumed any city larger than Minneapolis would of course have a 24-7 rail system as well. Long story short though, on my most recent San Francisco trip I had to catch a 5am plane at the SF International Airport and was surprised to learn that the Bart wouldn't be able to get me there since it's closed between the hours of 1am-5am. Despite this major snafu, I'm still leaving a four star review because I love public transportation (weird, I know). So make it a train, and I'm like a kid who wants to spend her day riding the mall escalator over and over."
242,1,"Apr 17, 2015","I'm lost for words when it comes to how much I hate BART. Everything about it sucks from the ride quality to the customer service. Here's why:1. Overcrowded trains - if BART knows there's a buncha people that ride this heap during rush hour, they should have more trains or cars but instead, they allow people to cram in like a buncha sardines.2. The fares - it seems like every other year, BART increases fares and for what? Riders don't get more frequent trains or cleaner cars. It also seems like escalators constantly fail. Good luck if you have a sprained ankle. The El Cerrito plaza center raised there parking fare from a $1 in cash to $3 in a year. Also if you don't have cash after you fight someone for a parking spot, God be with you because the machines only accept cash. 3. Delays - I used to ride BART from the east bay to San Francisco every morning for work. Almost always was I delayed. Medical emergencies, train in front of ours, stop and go traveling through the tunnel etc. One day, I left an hour earlier than normal to anticipate a delay and I still managed to come into work 30 minutes late due to a ""medical emergency"". 4. The union - BART employees are the highest public transportation employees in the country. Yet they always want raises and when they don't get them, they shut down BART and most of the Bay Area is a sh!t show during commute hours. Higher ups of BART are too stupid to realize they should hire a buncha temp employees to train them during the negotiation months to operate trains incase this moron union decided to throw another b!tch fit.5. Ride quality - if you've ever ridden BART, I'm sure you'll know it always seems like the damn heater is on or you're in a sauna because it's just really overcrowded. Either way, with increasing fares, you'd figure BART would have money to install AC or some type of temperature control machine in these overcrowded cars. Each train during rush hour commute is a breathing ground for sickness and diseases. The one time I ride BART this week is the time I caught the flu. Thanks BART. 6. The lack of bathrooms - the other day may train took 40 minutes to pick me up and nearly two hours to get me home. If you ever need to take a piss due to a ""medical emergency"" or any other BS delay, do it before you ride this heap. There aren't any bathrooms in most of the stations."
243,1,"May 16, 2009","I absolutely loathe BART. One time my friend made the mistake of hitting one of the BART seats and we were both appalled by all of the dust and dirt that flew out of the seats. Totally disgusting and now I feel like any clothes I wear on BART I should wash when I get home. I'm also frustrated b/c I commute on a BART, and at least once a week there seems to be some type of delay. BART keep raising prices, but I don't see any improvements. Plus its frustrating to see how much more efficient and cheaper public transportation is in other major cities like New York and Chicago, and even in Europe like Paris and London."
244,4,"Jul 8, 2009","It never occurred to me to review my transit options before, but after staring at an unusually large stain on the floor of my BART car this morning I figured I'd share my thoughts.No, I did not figure out what that large stain was. It was rather creepy now that I think about it. Blood or urine? Random beverages? I dunno, and the stains are always in the corner of the car, but this one was huuuuge.But stains aside, BART picks me up from a few blocks from the pad and delivers me safely near work, and for how many trains are going on all the time I don't think the delays are really that big of deal. Get more routes in the city to be a ""proper subway"" and I'd say we can be BFF."
245,3,"Aug 2, 2011","Obviously BART is one word, CONVENIENT! Its great for those that want to come into the city, have a great time which involves alchie and not worry about driving. Also, it's great for the commuters that need to get to the main metropolitan areas...The ullltimate dissapointment, for me personally is the hours of operation, they seriously need to consider running the trains if not 24/7, to at least 3am on weekends. This way we don't have to worry bout drunk drivers.The hours is a personal issue for me, because my brother&i have missed a bart train from SF to UC before, and that crap is not fun...it's super stressful!EXTEND YOUR HOURS BART! For those that have rode Bart, it's FILTHY! I try me best to avoid wearing flip-flops when I know I'm going to ride bart. I try to wear clothes where my  skin is not coming into contact with anything. Fair warning the pee/dirty smell is something you eventually get used to. Bottom line, Bart is great if u don't want to drive, and also to save gas. Time wise, plan accordingly cuz your trip may take longer than planned due to all the stops!"
246,5,"Aug 14, 2011","Part of why SF works so well as a city is because of BART.  A city as dynamic, beautiful, and cohesive as San Francisco is tied together with a mass transit system that works.  BART isn't just the trains...it's the buses that connect well, it's the drivers who smile and chat with you, and it's the consistently courteous SF residents who give up their seats for the elderly when those resident board.Like the Tube in London, BART works on distance-based fares, not flat fees.  BART is why you don't need a car in SF - whether you are visiting or living here.  For everything else there's a Zipcar. :-)"
249,3,"May 19, 2013","Well, it's far from perfect, but it's the best we've got.  For the most part BART transports us to and from work and other activities.  They've done so since the 1970s.  When it opened it was kind of futuristic.  A little like Tomorrowland at Disneyland.  But like Tomorrowland time has passed BART by.  Now it is aging and in need of major overhauls.   Trains and stations are filthy, overcrowded and inefficient.BART needs to do more policing of bad behaving passengers.  For the most part passengers work together to make the best of overcrowded commute or special event clogged trains.  However, I have seen too many louts blocking 4 seats with bikes while the car is overly crowded with standing passengers.  Or the pigs taking two or more seats and refusing to share the space with others.  Other passengers should not have to confront these belligerent thugs.  Passengers should also move into the cars and avoid crowding at the exits.BART contributes to the problem by running shorter trains.  It is exasperating to wait for a Fremont or Richmond train while 3 or 4 virtually empty 10 car other trains pass only to be packed into a 3, 4 or 5 car train.There are other issues that others have identified, but BART is the best we've got.  Considering the deplorable state of AC Transit, BART does okay."
250,1,"Jun 15, 2015",You made us wait in the cold today at the 853 am east Dublin because the driver had only like one door open all the way in front  what bs nonsense is this I paid to board not get shut outside for 10 minutes. There's no good logic to not open more doors. We expect a reply to this ASAP.#2 as I write this I'm looking at dirt all around seats and windows and outside looks dirty too. Do better job cleaning. #3 get a better Ac system that supports capacity else charge me less for half the service quality. Get your act together.
251,1,"Oct 26, 2015","The most respectful, safe, clean, trustworthy, fun, wholesome people do not ride BART."
252,4,"Mar 5, 2015","BART just plain out ROCKS!Sure, I wish it was a 24 hour affair. Yes, your police are scary. Would be nice if it were subsidized and offered as a public service for free. Yet still, BART is amazing, zinging along the bottom of the Bay in a tube at 80 mph? WOW! Just go to most other cities and try to get around the way you can on BART. Uniquely Bay Area and very coolio.You lose a star because we lost Oscar Grant."
253,4,"Mar 31, 2008","We love Bart in our household. Highlights:- No need to drive into the city. We're not big fans of dealing with city driving and getting around and all.- No need to deal with traffic. Saves a lot of frustration and expletives from the hub.- No need to look for parking. Saves a lot of time and $$.- Super convenient to get to mission, union square, financial, and embarcardero areasLowlights (my flip side to highlights):- We still have to drive to Daly City (don't want to take Milbrae since 101 is so crowded and caltrain doesn't have a flexible enough schedule)- Not everything is in a bartable and walkable range. We don't know muni too well, but cab it from union square hotel if we need to go farther.- If we do major shopping there's no place to put our bags- Doesn't leave after bar closing time--that would be ideal to have a few trains at 2:30 or 3am...- Would be nice if the interiors were upgraded at some pointI'll still use this for going to bartable locations in the city."
254,4,"Apr 21, 2009","4 or 5 stars - when you compare it to NYC's MTA or Philly's lousy SEPTA - BART is a rapid transit gem.  yes, iut's a little steep.  Some stations are filthy, but in general I am a huge fan of BART.Wish we had more public transport in this country."
255,4,"Jan 2, 2009","I agree that context IS everything and compared to  SEPTA in Philly and NYC Metro - BART is clean, safe and efficient.  It is not nearly as expansive as NYC's system - but it is newer and way cleaner.And it beats the heck outta SEPTA.I was a big BART user and I support BARTS expansion and use."
256,4,"Jul 24, 2011","Fast.  Efficient.  (Relatively) clean.  (Usually) safe.  Reasonably priced.Despite the negative publicity that BART has had over the last two years, it continues to rock as a system of mass transit, connecting the East Bay (both north and south) with The City, and BART has plans to expand as far south as San Jose.  Mass transit as it should be.  I gave BART that fourth star because of its access to San Francisco International and Oakland Airports (are you listening, Raleigh Durham?  THIS is the way it should be!)...  Kudos to BART!"
257,5,"Feb 8, 2012","Why I love BART.1.  I can get to and from work easily, plus to any bay area destination with the assistance of MUNI, AC, or just plain walking.  2.  I can leave the car at home and not worry about traffic, road rage, the cost of gasoline, toll booths, cops in my rear view mirror, parking fees, parking tickets, wasting my time looking for a place to park, etc.3. I can read the paper, or my kindle, get work done, listen to my mp3 all while leaving the driving to someone else.4. Trains are virtually always on time, if not then it's only a few minutes extra wait unless of course there's some sort of emergency.5.  Paying by Clippercard.  It's quick, efficient, and you can reload your card anytime, either online or at any BART or MUNI station.Things that annoy me:1.  The solicitors that manage to roam the trains2.  The crowded trains at rush hour especially around Powell St./Civic center.  Sometimes there's no room to even get on.  3.  The lack of restrooms at many stations.  EVERY station ought to have a restroom available.4.  I do wish there was more of a police presence on board the trains.5.  Smelly people who don't bathe or wash their clothes.  There are a lot of complaints about this from other reviewers but this is not BART's fault.  However, the new easy-to-clean seat coverings is a big improvement.  The pros out-weigh the cons by far, as far as I'm concerned.  And for those who complain about BART being horrible or the worst system in the country, you obviously haven't tried the New York subway."
258,3,"Oct 2, 2015","I'm not going to argue against BART as the fastest and often most reliable form of public transport in the bay area. I will say however, that when something did go wrong, my customer service experience was horrible. When asking politely about a malfunctioning machine, I was instantly treated to the answer, ""it didn't do that. What did it do?"" When I explained, I was met with ""that's not my problem,"" followed by multiple, painstakingly condescending answers to my simple desire to find someone who could help me. Take the BART, just realize that they have Comcast-grade customer service."
259,4,"Nov 7, 2009",I only got to ride the BART a handful of times and I'm still not sure what to think about. As much as people talk crap about the CTA I still think it's the best. Plus you pay one price for one ride. You don't have to pay by how far your going. (I guess could be a plus or minus).Great things about BART is that it connects the Multiple cities across the bay area. You can't beat it. Also it was always on time and I love the updates on when the train is coming into the station. Futuristic cars but still aging but very roomy. I wish we had open cars like that here in Chicago. It would help with all those people and there luggageStill I felt confused on which line I should be jumping on. Somehow I always ended up on the Yellow line which was fine with me because that's where I needed to be. Overall I am just a fan of Pub Trans and I would definitely ride the BART again. No questions asked.
262,1,"Dec 6, 2017",I keep hearing these advertisement for ride BART and how the fares will be going up .20. But I don't ride BART because 1. it is never on time. 2. I work in SF and I have to be at work at 4 am. 3. On sundays BART doesn't start until 8 am when I have to be at work at 7am. So I drive it makes no sense to even attempt to ride public transportation here in the East Bay. Now SF has the right idea there muni system is AWESOME! 24/7 service and it's ontime. I moved here from the east coast where you have public transportation 24/7. Sad for the East bay.. I guess I will always have to drive until I move to another state.
263,5,"Jul 6, 2010","BART is a great light rail system used to get around the Bay Area. I especially like it since it goes to SFO and there are connecting stops with the MUNI. Great way to maneuver within SF or the Bay Area. BART is fast, efficient, fairly priced, and has accessible locations. I've used the BART to travel to various areas within the Bay Area and have had no problems whatsoever. Hawaii will eventually build its light rail system. I'm hoping i will be just as good or better (*knock on wood*)."
264,4,"Jan 23, 2011","It's kind of pricey for public transportation but was cheaper than getting a cab and faster and more convenient than a bus or a cab.  I used it to get from SFO to the Civic Center.My friend who lives in SF for years assumed it runs 22 hours / day / everyday.Not the case, here are the hours:Weekdays, 4:00 am - MidnightSaturday, 6:00 am - MidnightSunday, 8:00 am - Midnighthttp://www.bart.gov/schedules/bystation.aspxIt's also very crowded and not very clean (understandable, but still)."
265,4,"Jan 29, 2011","I recently returned to the Bay Area for a visit. BART is definitely a great means of transport. Yesterday, I took BART from Fruitvale Station to 24th and Mission. BART was on time and took me to my destination ontime.When you go through the transbay tube though, it can be quite noisy. In fact, portions of BART can be really noisy so you may be advised to wear earplugs. One new improvement to BART is that they removed the old green carpet from the floor. That green carpet reminded me of barf and overtime was getting extremely worn by the foot traffic.BART is more on the pricer end in terms of cost. You pay by distance. There are kiosks located at each station. You purchase the ticket, insert the ticket through the turnstile and retrieve the ticket as you pass through the turnstile. This ticket will have to be used again when you exit your final destination.Some of the stations are shady, so be vigilant and be aware of your surroundings. The best thing about BART is that one the route conveniently takes you directly from SFO into the city. From OAK, there is an AirBART bus, not as convenient as SFO."
266,3,"Jan 3, 2012","I normally love BART - it gets me to work every morning and saves me on gas, wear and tear on my car, bridge toll and expensive SF parking.  But to have an 8 car train followed by a 5 car train on the Pittsburg/Bay Point line during regular commute hours is absolutely ridiculous!!  They shouldn't even think of having an 8 car train on that line in the morning or evening commutes.  Also, the train doesn't run until 8 am on Sundays so while they want you to take the train to SFO, you can't if you have any flights before 10:30 a.m. on Sunday.They say how much it costs them to run 24 hours (or even til 3 a.m. on a weekend night) but there are a few things they could do to make riding BART more convenient for customers - but they refuse to.Get with the program BART"
267,3,"Oct 17, 2012","The essential mode of transportation for getting around through SF! Sure, it only makes a few stops, so it's not exactly useful for getting to specific places (i.e. you still need to do a lot of walking once you get off the nearest BART exit)...but at least it's much faster and cleaner than the buses in SF! It can get a little pricey at around $8.25 on average for most places, but you can re-load your card anytime, so you don't lose out on any money you've already paid for. Overall, I'm impressed by how organized the system is, considering SoCal has nothing like this!"
268,1,"Jun 19, 2015","Well just when I thought Bart couldn't get any more disgusting.  This morning on the SF AIRPORT train from pittsburg baypoint my husband had to kill a ROACH. Omg as if the smell of urine and feces and those who either don't or can't wash their funky behinds, add to that their disgusting restrooms it's enough to ruin your appetite, clothes and day.SHAME ON YOU BART,"
269,1,"Jul 13, 2017",Worst public transit in the country. Outrageously priced compared to other cities. Terrible service and dirty. Not worth the longer commutes.
270,1,"Jun 18, 2018","I love Bart. I ride it often. But it's a little after midnight and the train just stopped in the middle of the trans-bay tube. When I first arrived at Powell street station to get the train, the digital signs indicated it would be 10 minutes before the train arrived. So I feel extremely confident in saying there isn't backed up train traffic. What the F? Boooo, BART, booooo. Hustle up."
271,5,"May 14, 2007","BART is wonderful.  It is cleaner than any other subway/metro system (NYC, DC, Chicago, Boston).  Unlike most, it has plush seats and carpet.  The trains are always on time.  People wait in line in a civilized manner instead of pushing onto the train en masse.  The other really great thing about BART is easy access to information.  Online, it is easy to use Trip Planner and map routes and find schedules.  At the station, there are signs to tell you exactly which train is approaching, plus maps and schedules.  They announce when trains will be arriving, and which ones when and where.  None of these things happen in NY on the subway, where you have to figure out if the train is express or local, they aren't well-labeled, it's hard to figure out which is which direction, and if you go in the wrong entrance, you've lost your subway fare and have to repay once you go in the other way."
274,4,"Jul 20, 2008","I love BART. I save so much money from taking it. It's convenient, usually pretty dependable, and with gas prices the way they are these days...really, public transportation is the way to go.I've met my fair share of interesting people on this thing though. There are the nice old Chinese ladies who don't really know what stop to get off at, so I help em' out if I can understand them. There are the hippies and the drunks.And then there are the pervs, like the one that decided it'd be cool to sit a couple feet away from me and stare (and stare, and stare some more...) while openly masturbating. Yeah, that was pretty freaking disgusting.But other than that, I can't complain."
275,3,"Nov 17, 2008","It was my first time riding the BART last week. Before coming up to the bay area I had heard mixed reviews about it.The BART trains do come quite frequent. At the Millbrae station my friend told me that they are usually nice and wait a few minutes for the CalTrain ppl to arrive. But I guess that day they weren't so nice. When I stepped into the train I immediately noticed the carpeted floors. I thought it was nice, but I thought again about how it must be gross when it rainy and the floor must be all wet. And carpet in general is not easy to clean. Their seats remind me a lot of airplane seats. The ride northbound from Milbrae to SF was VERY loud and squeaky. For each of the stops, I couldn't hear the operator announce the stops. I wish they had something like the lightrail where the name of the next stop is flashing in red. The BART stops at every stop, which can be a bit slow of a commute. The ride itself is quite smooth. People standing with bikes can comfortably stand with their bike when the train stops. The trains are always packed, especially when you near SF."
276,3,"Jun 25, 2018","BART has a bit of a reputation for being dirty and nasty, and while that is somewhat true, it hardly ever gets so bad that it bothers me. The lines extend to a lot of the bay, so it's pretty convenient. The stations are a little dirty, but the fares are reasonable and you can always buy a Clipper Card. Also, sometimes trains can be too far apart, but it's not too bad. The new trains look clean and sound quieter, maybe that'll improve the service."
277,1,"Feb 13, 2020","It's 60 degrees outside and the air conditioner is on. Seats on this ""new"" 3 door train are hard and packed so close together my knees are jammed into someone's hip. You can't actually move from car to car anymore cause the engine cars completely block off the aisle. The ""new"" car is supposed to be quieter according to the signs but the sound seems to echo and carry more. Just not a pleasant experience overall I'd rather have the smelly screechy old cars back."
278,1,"Feb 6, 2015","Let me first say that in no way do I blame the BART union for why BART needs improvement. Do ""medical emergencies"" on trains in other major cities mean the whole system shuts down until the situation is cleared? Because this happens probably 10 times per week on average. One would think the big boys in business would be furious about the effect on the economy.That's not all. The stations reek of urine (unnecessary) the train cars break down constantly. BART is pricey to ride. Where the heck are our tax dollars and ticket monies going?!? Fix this everloving mess of a transit system asap people. I could keep going but it's too much work on a phone keyboard right now."

I also see drunk bums sleeping and snoring in the train. Heidous sight, isn't it?Also, the overpaid,& uneducated station agents (mostly ladies) are not the friendliest. They may get paid very well, but they are extremely rude to riders,especially visitors who want to go to the Airport. The station agents gets away with capital punishment and verbal assault.What comes out of their month is like the filth and dust of BART train.BART must be cautious and selective on the hiring process."
286,3,"Oct 3, 2008","I have no problems with the public transportation system that surrounds San Francisco. Like my trip to New York, there is an AirTrain that goes from San Francisco International Airport to an underground transportation system. In New York, the AirTrain took me to the MTS subway system. In this case, the AirTrain went to the BART station after about four stops. For those of you uninitiated, the BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) is an underground train system that begins at SFO Airport and extends through the city of San Francisco and into Oakland and the East Bay. It goes as far north as Concord, passing Berkeley on the way. The BART moves fast, is clean, and relatively quiet. We arrive at the Powell St. station to get to our hotel.The BART was less friendly on our little diversion to Oakland to see the Chargers-Raiders game last Sunday. Getting there from the Powell St. station was fine. Make one transfer onto the train bound for the Coliseum and you were set. Only leaving the game became a hassle. A giant human traffic jam met us outside the stadium and in the elevated walking bridge to the platform. We walked for nearly a half hour amongst drunken Raiders fans (I was reminded of Sean Connery's line in The Last Crusade about being ""pilgrims in an unholy land""), then resorting to taking the Concord train to get away from the human masses gathered at the Coliseum platform, then transferring to a train that went into San Francisco. Ugh!"
287,3,"Jan 16, 2009",At least panhandlers try to earn their money by trying to help newbies buy tickets and figure out their direction.  I like it better than the Metrolink where my entire car was asked to move.  It feels more comfortable to me than Metro North Rail.  I've never ridden it with musicians playing.  Its reliable but my friend complained that it smelled old.
288,4,"Apr 16, 2009","BART?  What can I say about San Francisco's public transportation.  I'm from San Diego, Ca and our public transportation is terrible.  So, I'm comparing BART to San Diego's public transportation.One note I wish BART offered.  A 3,5, or 7 day pass like how the Muni is set up.  If the BART offered this feature, it would've received 5 stars."
289,3,"Jan 11, 2018","It's a useful conveyance to the many wonders of the Bay. I like the fact that there's a couple stations close to me, but I can't wait for the new cars"
290,3,"Jan 31, 2018","Honestly, the BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) as is, is in need of major upgrades to their trains, the bathrooms are always locked and not able to use, and the elevators smell horribly. In recent news and experience it is being remodeled (slowly). The new train on the track is absolutely beautiful and clean and state of the art. BART is easily accessed from Richmond to Millbrae, to Fremont to Pittsburg. There are many other stops along the way. You can access both Oakland & San Francisco Airports directly. SF airport requires one transfer to Caltrain but it isn't that difficult. The prices have raised this year 2018. There is also a surcharge to using BART's paper ticket vs. the clipper card. Clipper card's cost 3$ one time. Each time you use a paper ticket you are charged an extra .50 cents per trip. So invest in a clipper card. Elevator access is almost every BART location is riddled with human pee. I recommend you avoid elevator access at all times. It's simply unmanageable on the smell. It is in part due to no public access for the homeless community to use. Three stars because you can get across the Bay in under an hour. By car, can take two to three hours almost all times of the day in traffic."
291,4,"Sep 4, 2007","BART can save you money.  Really.  It's nice not having to drive on occasion too.  I only  wish they would let us add together all the old tickets accrued over the days.  They should operate late night too(if they could afford to at least).  I remember the races we used to have at each stop coming back from Dublin skate park.....start from the back door, run out the exit to the platform, into the next car, slap the adjoining door, run back out, then into the car you started in.  There were afew close calls with friends being left behind, but it was all fun...Don't forget you can use your adult MUNI fast pass on BART in the city."

I'll punch in you in the head"".6) no accountability by bart police -- they will not answer public inquiries about what caused a  ""police activity"" delay (in comparison, local police depts. print brief description of contact and crimes in local newspapers.)  numerous ""police activity"" delays at https://twitter.com/sfbartalert7) no accountability by bart board for past mistakes on infrastructure and on 2013 significant error in labor contract vote.My suggestion to citizens of the Bay Area is to use public transportation in other cities and countries whenever you travel to get an idea of what is reasonable in public transportation.  The Bay Area has become numb to the gross deficiencies of bart.  We pay for and deserve better."
293,5,"Sep 5, 2014","After 4 years in the Bay Area, I've now ridden BART hundreds of times and a review is well overdue. However, since this is my 150th review, and channeling Amy Z's cable car review, I'm going to do something a little different.Here are 10 things I've seen on BART or at stations over the years:10. Myself, carrying a windsurfing mast (it's 7 foot broken down). BART police came to check it out. 9. Wine bottle opener left on a bench. Now attached to kitchen via uphaul (bungee cord) to sailing club kitchen table. 8. Woman dressed as twister game at Halloween. 7. The great view from the Rockridge platform. 6.  A/C breaking down during the middle of summer. 5. The guy who plays Cello on the Pittsburg line. Makes a nice change from the family who does bad renditions of Beatles songs. 4.  The irregular Giants, A's, Raiders fans who take all the seats from us ""regulars"". No, it's cool and all, except when you drink! 3. The guy smoking an e-cigarette in my face. 2. The guy who turned down his cell phone *very slightly* after I said it was too loud. 1. The people talk loudly on their phones. My all-time favorite was just recently. A white woman, having apparent baby-daddy issues, ripping a new one from some guy for a full 20 minutes including through the transbay tunnel (and maybe beyond, she got off before me). The best part ""He pays more for my phone because you're CHEAP!"". Just how do you get two guys to pay for your phone? All in all, BART is pretty great. The problem is the occasional idiots, which are hardly their fault. Staff have always been nice to me, it's almost always reliable. It just doesn't go everywhere. Go on, admit it. You love BART too."
294,1,"Aug 6, 2014","The filthiest, most corrupt public transit organization in America - after MUNI. I cant remember the last time I had access to one of their filthy seats -it's always packed with non-functioning A/C it seems. I loooove watching the booth agents read the newspaper while they collect their $100k comp while giving attitude to tourists. Someone needs to record their jobs on Youtube for all to see where their fare money and tax dollars are going.It will be particularly funny when the $500 million connector to Oakland Airport results in fares skyrocketing again - or when smart groups of business travelers split the $13 cab fare from Coliseum directly to the terminal door - rather than risking their wallet on the $6 driverless trams crawling to the Oakland Airport parking lot. Even better would be smart Uber or Lyft drivers shuttling airport patrons back to the terminal for $9 a run. And we will NEVER forget the one week strike that held us all hostage. I was unable to visit a sick relative. Did you enjoy your little strike ? So much corruption, it makes me sick to pay them."
295,5,"Dec 19, 2015",We are still tourists getting the hang of BART.  But when we do get it right - BART is fabulous in getting people around San Francisco.  We were helped by the good people on the train with some of our questions and we didn't discover the website for BART until the end of this trip - better than some of the apps we had on our phones.  It was nice to think about helping the environment getting from The Wharf to SFO as well as getting there so quickly and efficiently.
298,2,"Jun 15, 2015","Bart is only good for getting from point A to point B, though you should expect to feel gross as hell by the time you get to point B every single day.  I'm not going to complain about the stinky messes on every car, those types of events are hard to control because of the shear number of disgusting people in Bay Area.My main gripes with Bart are:  1.  It is always late.  Always.  2.  It is usually vastly over-crowded, likely because it's always late.  3.  The cars are humid as fuck, even when not crowded.  To touch upon the last point a bit, I'm a decently fit guy yet every SINGLE morning, I have to plan extra time on the way to my SF office bathroom to utilize paper towels for wiping all the sweat off my body resulting from the humid-assed Bart cars.  This morning in particular, it was decently cold outside.  I chose to wear my lightest jacket, and I STILL was sweating my ass off, along with everyone else, in my Bart car (which surprisingly was not over-crowded like it usually is).  I'm almost 100% sure the heat wasn't even on.  You want to know what the real culprit is??? No fucking air-flow.  When you have no fans (or shitty fans) operating within Bart cars, the shear number of people alone will turn it into a disgustingly sweaty eco-system for disease."
299,3,"Feb 14, 2009","I take BART just about everyday to and from work (S. Hayward station to Macarthur station). The Pros: I save on gas (big truck not so good on gas), I don't have to pay for parking at work (not to mention maneuvering around the garage with the truck), I get to relax/sleep/read to and from work, I've made friends on BART (those regulars you see everyday), avoid traffic, no chance of getting into a car accident, wear and tear on a vehicle, it's usually on time by the minute (which in turn makes you more punctual), and above all,  it's good for the environment!The Cons:You don't get to enjoy driving your vehicle, the crazy/drunk/drugged out hoodlums and/or lowlifes, the stops aren't as convenient as the NY subway for example (after getting to my stop, I still have to take a shuttle to work), it takes a little longer than if I actually drove to work, it sometimes gets dirty, without an ipod, you cant fall asleep bc of the immature people that talk loud on their phones, it can sometimes gets crowded, if you ever take BART in the middle of the day, there aren't your 9-5 commuters, there are a bunch of drunks and kids that cut school, parking at the BART station isn't the safest (knock on wood), the BART delays SUCK!"

304,1,"Apr 21, 2019","While this beats sitting in 90 mins of traffic, that is all I can say about it. I have ridden BART for over 25 years up until about 2 years ago, and I can say it was decent when I started riding, and has gotten worse every year, mostly due to overcrowding. Today I rode it hopefully for the last time. As soon as I got on at West Oakland (thankfully I was only going to Civic Center), a gangbanger smashes out his LIT joint on the side of the seat. Why was this allowed to happen? Because EVERYTHING is *allowed* to happen on BART. Homeless sleeping on two seats? Check. Homeless person on every car with no ticket? Check. Homeless shoving you out of the way or holding open the door? Check. Homeless sleeping in the stations by the dozen? Check. Human waste smell in every city station (yes, just like you've heard)? Check. Want to know the response when you call to complain? ""It's not a crime to be homeless."" That is seriously the response they give you, verbatim. Yes, but it IS a crime to ride without a ticket. I PAY for this service, they do NOT. I will never ride this mobile homeless shelter ever again if at all possible."
305,1,"Jun 25, 2019","I used to take Bart to Oakland and then take the sky shuttle to the airport. I stopped doing that, due to feeling unsafe. As a female alone I just had to many weird things happen on Bart to make me feel safe. Not once did I ever see a security person or anyone that protected us on the trains. I now ask a friend to take me to the airport. If I use Bart now it is only in a group situation & somewhere local. How sad because I enjoyed my independence once and not depending on others to take me at odd times."

308,2,"Sep 16, 2017","Bart or Bay Area Rapid Transit, a convenient inconvenience. Yes they transport over 400,00 patrons to and from the East Bay everyday. Now for the downsides... As fares continue to rise, we as the lowly patrons have come no closer to an end to the constant delays associated with: Track Issues, Medical Emergencies, Police Activity, Train Back-ups, and Single Tracking. Why is it when you get to those stations, it is as if nothing happened, is it just me? If you're running late just be a big boy/girl as an agency and say ""We apologize, but we're running late today."" I'm not saying that these things do not happen, however there are about 3 delays a week, and these are the regular announcements, if there are any announcements made. I'd honestly feel a whole lot better if you'd actually be truthful with me though. So on top of all of this, Bart employees treat their patrons like garbage, get paid a whole lot to do so, and throw in a strike from time to time. All of this is not the way a public transport system and/or any company should operate. Look I am just a patron who helps you as an individual/company (Bart) pay for the gas in your expensive car, it is not my fault that you live outside your means, do not take that out on us as patrons. Bad Attitudes, Expensive Fares, Expensive Parking, Terrible Bathrooms all make up the face that is Bart. With all this being said, I still take Bart everyday, because what alternative do I have that is environmentally and socially conscious and correct. DO A BETTER JOB AT BEING COURTEOUS, RESPECTFUL, AND APPROPRIATE, JUST MAYBE YOU'D HAVE LESS COMPLAINTS!* This stems from an incident that happened to me yesterday (Sept. 15th, 2017), when I was verbally accosted by a Bart employee named Adriana @ the MacArthur Station in Oakland, CA. A complaint has been filed. If you are a patron and you have ever been singled-out, or disrespected... Make your voice known!"
311,3,"Sep 7, 2015","BART parking is priced too low, and the lots fill up immediately (meaning prior to 8AM).I traveled to San Francisco Bay Area for the 2nd time, two  years in a row for the VMworld Conference held at the Moscone Convention Center. BART is the only option really if you choose to stay in a motel/hotel outside San Francisco as there is little or no parking downtown. Keep in mind the hotel rooms are $300 to $600 per night during this convention.Since my first session was never before 8:30AM, I thought I would ride the BART system into downtown around 8AM. The problem is you WILL NOT find a parking space at most of their park and ride locations. I went from station to station using the WAZE app on my phone on two different mornings. Here are the stations I could not find parking at after 8AM:No Parking after 8AM (until 10AM): Richmond, Berkley NorthThe only station I consistently found good parking was at Hayward.The cost to park varies, from $2/day to $2.50/day. I heard from other travelers on the system that the parking rate has gone up to the aforementioned prices. They need to consider raising these per day rates again, to reduce the number of people using the parking lot so that travelers like myself have half a chance to park their rental cars. I would go even as far as having a designated section of the their lots where you can choose to pay a higher rate, as in $5/day to pretty much guarantee parking for riders who are willing to pay more to save time, etc.The trains themselves are fine, arrive and depart on time and charge according to distance traveled. My average fare was $4.90 per trip. The need more fare card machines inside and outside the stations too as some are broken, or only accept cash.The only other MAJOR problem with BART is they take the system out of service too often between Oakland and San Francisco to perform maintenance. This is the second time this summer the system has been down for more than one day."

313,4,"Feb 5, 2010","For reasons both familial and professional, I've always considered myself bi. Coastal, that is. One of the major perks in my escape from behind the Orange Curtain was BART. I love my family, but I don't miss the 5, 405, 91 or the 10 freeways. While BART does not have the extensive range or highly desirable schedule that other Tubes, Bullet Trains or Subway Systems have... I still adore it for the pure entertainment value. BART is where I can truly be a voyeur, since I'm the only one NOT listening to an iPod, nodding off with my mouth open, or completely engrossed in the WSJ or a good bodice-ripper novel. Morning commutes are almost completely silent, with a few exceptions: (a) Young College student on her mobile, ""confiding"" to her BFF that she's pregnant and is on the fence about scheduling an abortion. ""Promise me, no - seriously - swear to me that you WILL NOT TELL ANYONE!"" She practically screamed into her cell. ""Can you hear me now? Yeah, so... where was I? Oh, I'm going to Italy for that work-study... in the Spring, and he's like... hella freaked out. I know. So, of course I wanna have kids someday, just not right now. But PROMISE me you will NOT LET THIS GET OUT. I would be so embarrassed if anyone knew."" (b) I have watched educated, professional women (primarily) hold onto the rails, and LICK THEIR FINGERS between each page turn of their bodice-ripper book. And eat full-blown meals, ranging from McBillions to coffee house muffins and sandwiches. Fascinating AND disgusting. Purell, anyone? And maybe pay attention to the fine you can incur for eating on BART, never mind the microbes, germs and other filth you're ingesting along with that bagel. (c) Jeebus, Mary and Joseph... what is that horrific smell? It *could* be the Service Dog... or maybe it was actually that corpulent guy 2 seats over, who conspicuously shifted his weight and now looks more notably relieved. Yeah... even the Service Dog is whimpering, it was the guy. (d) My favorite: A woman and her 2 young children board; a guy in a suit and tie is sitting on the inside of a 4 seater configuration; Mom and kids are facing each other. Mom is multi-tasking - alternately berating her children or threatening to beat them. The oldest is in first grade, tops. All of this dramz while she's on her cell, regaling her friend about the fight she had with ""some bitch"" - and she's dropping the F-bomb like it's going out of style. I felt empathy for the children, but they were so insubordinate and unfazed by the stream of profanity spewing from their Mom's mouth, it was actually very sad. ""Oh, wait, girl - I'm gonn' hafta call you back, I'm goin' through a - Hello?"" She'd start in on the kids again. ""Why didn't you let yo' sister use the bathroom this mornin'? What the f*ck is wrongwitchoo? Y'all better f*cken get yo' sh*t together; 'cuz I ain't gonn' tell you one mo' 'gain."" WTF? My degree is in Literary Journalism, so all of the grammatical issues were a very close second in the whole level of discomfort for how the children were treated. Not to mention the poor suit and tie man, who seemed to be melting into the wall, so as to put as much space between himself and Moms. ""Oh, girl... So where was I? Oh, yeah - so then I called her up and was all, Bitch, you don't know me! I will f*ck you up!"" Road Rage vs. BART Dramz. But seriously, Girl: I do not f*ckin' miss the sh*tty traffic - AND I AIN'T GONN' TELL YOU ONE MO' 'GAIN!"

Where am I supposed to keep the fucking thing, in my teeth like a pirate? - When you have to set up booths to exchange the ""tiny tickets"" with remainders on them, your system is fundamentally flawed.  When the prices are set up so that there is no reasonably easy way to travel regularly without ending up with remainders, your system is a god damn scam. - BART finally implemented their EZ-Rider tickets, like an EZ pass for BART people.  It's a limited program (WHY?) and you have to MAIL-IN a printed out PDF application.  I suppose this is better than sending a herald, or having it delivered by Pony Express, but what the hell, man??? The Stations: - The spectrum of filth varies from abattoir to back-alley, often scented with that horrible industrial cleanser.  No trash cans = trash on floor, on seats, on me. - Manned by the most languid and irritatingly snobby people, the Ticket Booths are a mecca for institutionalized smartassery and heavy-lidded unhelpfulness.

Thanks for a voucher to go to a different station and turn it in to an exchange program - ARE YOU EFFIN SERIOUS???  (answer: yes)  No one could say ""sorry sir"" and mean it less than these drones. - The Embarcadero escalators are broken every single day.  EVERY DAY!  For years it's been like that.  I know the names of the repair people's KIDS for crying out loud. - I'm sure there's a good reason to have BART police outside the station in cars, but I'm not sure how much that helps me inside on the platform when Dr. Empty-Your-Pockets comes by. The Trains: - Public transportation that essentially dries up at 8PM is good for Backass, Nowhere but it's full-bore bullshit for a city that I think everyone would agree is one of the top-10 in the world.  Full closure at midnight?  Bollocks. - LRN 2 DRIVE PLZ.  At least 3 times this month the train has just gone right on down the platform, half the train past the station and half on the platform.  I don't even run to catch up like everyone else, I just laugh. - I'd like an hour or so in a closed room with the fucking hippie who decided that wrapped sponges was a good idea for public transportation seats.

317,4,"Mar 2, 2010","Long story short: I LOVE the BART.  I wish we had public transportation like this down in LA.Long story long:Otherwise known as Bay Area Rapid Transit, the BART is such a convenient and reliable means of transportation in and around San Francisco.  Each line reaches to 5 vital areas of the bay.  It goes as far South as Daly City to the Southwest, Fremont to the Southeast, Dublin and Pleasanton to the East, Concord and Pittsburg to the Northeast, and Richmond to the North.  They all run through the city center and covers all the major areas such as SFO, Oakland and its airport, and Berkeley.Each station is laid out slightly differently and even some stations will have multiple access points, but it all leads to the trains below.  Early in the morning and late in the afternoon, these trains will be packed with commuting professionals and even students.  Depending on which station you're at and the line, a train will come every few minutes.  As long as you're going to a station that serves multiple lines, you can hop on either train.This isn't the first time I've used the BART.  I've used it a few times over the years whenever I've been in the bay area, but my most recent trip, I relied HEAVILY on the BART to get me in and around town.  Fares are really cheap and you can purchase a $20 ticket that will most likely get you through the day depending on how many times you're in and out of the train.  When I drove up from San Jose to SFO, I purchased a $20 ""all day pass"" that took me into town so I could check into my hostel, then used it to get to Berkeley, going in and out a couple more times, then one last time to get back from Berkeley after dinner, and I still had a couple dollars to spare.  The next day, I just took that ticket and reloaded it with another $20.  That was enough to last me the remaining 1+ day I was in town.The stations themselves aren't the cleanest or the nicest, but they're relatively safe during the day.  I probably still wouldn't recommend traveling alone late at night if you are a woman.  The tunnels are virtually empty and well, you can never be too careful in a place like that.  Not to say you should fear for your life, but as some people say, ""better safe than sorry"".The stations in town are probably the best because they drop you off at some key places.  Embarcadero station drops you off 2 blocks from the Ferry Building, and the red line stops right in Downtown Berkeley.  It really is a prime example of convenience.  It's definitely much cheaper than taking a cab all over town.  Combine the BART with all the walking I did, it was a great way to get around town.I wish we had public transportation that was this reliable and convenient down here in LA.  Trust me, I've taken the metro and it's not as convenient as BART.I will always continue using the BART whenever I'm in the bay"

And I really don't like hauling all my shit around with me through crowded city streets - it makes me all off balance and I'm tippy - I'll just fall right over. However, on this trip I was shamed into taking the MF train into town:ME: I'll just rent a car this time - fuck it. We needs one anyhow.FRIEND: OH MY GOD TAKE THE FUCKING TRAIN YOU SPOILED ROTTEN PRINCESS, I WILL GET THE CAR TOMORROW.ME: BUT MY BAG IS HEAVY. Jesus. I'll just take a cab.FRIEND: CAN YOU  PAY OFF MY FUCKING STUDENT LOANS TOO MONEY BAGS??? JESUS, JUST TAKE THE TRAIN.ME: OK! *hobbles off to find BART platform, takes a couple wrong turns, and final makes it mumbling to self all the way about the niceness of airport pick-ups and how many I have made in my short life*I sat down on the train with all my two-tons of crap, put on my headphones and settled in. Immediately I remembered the last time I was on BART...I think I was 16 visiting, my step-g-parents in Orinda. I was given a pile of money, dropped off at the BART station and sent on my merry way. I remember being excited to be sent off to explore on my own, at the prospect of maybe scoring some freaking drugs in the big city and to ride the fancy NEW train (yes it was 1986....  :/) I am fairly certain the first thing I did when I sat down on the train was put on my headphones and settle in...I am fairly certain the TAPE in my WALKMAN was U2 - Unforgettable Fire.I spent that day wandering around, smoking, getting all hopped up on Cherry Cokes and Suzie Q's, wishing I could lay hands on some pot, finding ""Jumping Jack Flash"" playing in some sketchy theater on Market and being amazed that people were SMOKING IN THE THEATER (which I, of course, joined in), and being a punk kid from a much smaller city semi-overwhelmed by my surroundings.As I remember this, I update my Facebook status to:Nancy B.: The last time I rode BART I was listening to U2 on my WALKMAN. ( I should have added that BART was also still shiny and new back then, like I was. I hate having status update regret....)Friend immediately chimes in: See? If you had taken a cab, you wouldn't have gotten to have that memory.FINE.I still felt like a fucking pack horse walking from the friggin' station to my hotel and I was nearly tipped over like A MILLION TIMES.Rapid tranist is nice, can't wait til the year 2065, when we finally have it going on in Seattle...."
319,1,"Sep 1, 2013","Ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous.I am writing this at 7am. With the Bay Bridge closed for the grand opening on Tuesday, I was therefore relying on BART to get me over to the East Bay this morning for brunch at Brown Sugar Kitchen at 8amBART was trumpeting a 24 hour service to help out while th bridge is shutI woke up early and got to San Brino station to find it all locked up. I then used the BART trip planner to find out that the 24 hour service only runs until 4.52am and that the first BART train from anywhere on this side of the bay starts at 8am, whivh means I'll miss my brunch meeting with friendsSo, one star for your stupid incompetence, BART. And go back to school to find out what 24 hour really meansUseless and ridiculous, BART!!!!"
320,4,"May 14, 2009","BART lives up to its name. Having experienced New York's subway and Washington DC's metro in recent weeks, I award BART the best metro system award for our trip.The trains are frequent and the interval to the next train is wll signposted. We never had problems getting a seat. The trains travelled quickly unlike the NY subway, which could be really stop-start.Only thing is for a newcomer, the ticket machines can be confusing."
321,2,"Aug 5, 2013","I'll keep this short.I'm glad that a strike has been averted for 7 days (I didn't really want to carpool to work).Thank you, Governor Brown (my hookers were willing to thank him in person, but I told them no because the last thing he needs is a scandal).Bay Fair BART Station (8:02 this morning):There are often 2 annoying women on my morning train (they're annoying because they basically cut in front of me all the time).They have a great rapport with the female driver of the San Francisco train that arrives just before our Richmond train (the women actually ride the San Francisco train too). After the women disembark, the driver briefly chit-chats with them (it's like a little love fest).The 3 women were happy to see each other, and the driver is happy to be working.Anyway, the driver was asked about the negotiations:""They [management] haven't come up with a darn thing.They haven't budged.At all."" (The driver was visibly agitated and upset, like my wife when I forget to put the seat down. o_O)I take the driver's comments with a grain of salt (many reports indicate that at least some progress has been made).I also don't sympathize with BART employees.Still, I echo her frustration in this regard:""How long are we going to play this game?""Yes, indeed.This situation has caused me a fair amount of uncertainty and stress, and I know that I'm far from being alone.There needs to be a resolution, and quick.The lesbian has been looking hotter than ever lately (thank you, dear).That will comfort me a little this week as another countdown continues.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJCrb1oNbH4"

I received some emails at work last week urging me to support BART workers and one of the unions.Nope.It's not going to happen.I would be more sympathetic if the trains I rode were longer.In addition, ticket prices increased a number of months ago out of the blue.Parking fees have also just gone up.My previous reviews attest to the other problems I've had with BART.I'm keeping the rating at 2 stars because BART attracts a number of hot women.Thanks for bringing the babes in, especially the lesbian that I have a slight crush on. o_O http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOqk_q4NLLIUpdate (7/18): I'm glad that service resumed on the 5th. I hope a new contract is created before August 4.In terms of the raise, I heard different things. 22%. 24%. Regardless, BART employees are basically the highest paid transit workers in the nation already."
323,2,"Jul 20, 2012","Oh my.Fun times on BART.Fremont train, shortly before 6:Most A's fans are cool and casual (I'm one myself), but I was around some rowdy fans today (the A's, by the way, beat the damn Yankees 3-2 in the bottom of the 9th).Right after I boarded, a guy said ""mother------"" really loud.Another guy then chastised him playfully for a minute: ""What's wrong with you? There are kids on the train! It's a family friendly environment. You should get kicked off BART.""After that, somebody was called ""Jeremy Lin"" (he wasn't happy about it, but the guy did look like a shorter version of him).There were then some marijuana references.I was a bit nervous at first (I think a lot of the fans knew each other, but I didn't realize this until the marijuana references were made), but after that I began to chuckle.Still, I was happy when the fans cleared out (I was able to sit down).1 star for very smooth driving.1 star for the big boobed blonde (my eyes will never be the same again).An honorable mention to the guy she was with. He looked like Rollie Fingers (http://www.google.com/imgres?hl=en&client=firefox-a&hs=1k9&sa=X&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&biw=1152&bih=703&tbm=isch&prmd=imvnso&tbnid=1ImE0O4xsf0OlM:&imgrefurl=http://www.realclearsports.com/lists/hairstyles/rollie_fingers.html&docid=6m9qFSbI4FNH4M&imgurl=http://www.realclearsports.com/blognetwork/rcs_sidelines/Rollie%252520mustache.jpg&w=666&h=800&ei=bkwKUMPxH--u2gXP1uwo&zoom=1&iact=rc&dur=410&sig=106487334982657483695&page=1&tbnh=143&tbnw=147&start=0&ndsp=19&ved=1t:429,r:2,s:0,i:148&tx=90&ty=75).Some of the cars feature new seats (http://sfist.com/2012/04/24/behold_the_new_vinyl_bart_seat.php). I really like them.  The new floors are pretty nice too (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcHNrL1BqL0).There are some new carpets too, and they're ""very nice"" (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/E_gJNt58BLuAOeW9O42ySw?select=MwV1JNY7gvr9Nmn-fhXNFg#sYmSrwcqpJgBLUZC_JYplQ).Ticket prices recently went up out of the blue.It's not a big deal, but I'm now spending $.10 more a day.I was stuck on a 5-car train heading home on Thursday (the previous one was only 5 cars too- I could have boarded it, but didn't want to).Totally ridiculous (trains during commute hours should always have at least 8 cars).Bay Fair:The men's restroom has gone from bad to worse. It's truly been filthy lately.On another note, about 10 days ago the man in front of me swore at the one coming out. I stayed put for a few minutes (the second man was slow too, and I had to hold it so that I could catch my train), and am glad that they didn't come to blows (the man who came out lingered around awhile).For 5 weeks this year, I had to pay to park. The $1 fee isn't bad, and it was easy to use the parking machines (I always took my receipts- many riders don't). I would often catch early trains so that I could beat the traffic (driving to the station and finding a good parking spot would have been a chore otherwise), and the only challenge at times was to remember my parking space number. I appreciate the female agent who is sometimes around in the mornings.She works hard and often dresses like a Pussycat Doll (her legs are very sexy). There are really a lot of annoying riders (my friend Nicole rides BART too, and we were just talking about this a few days ago).Just this morning, a girl kept brushing my legs with her bag (I kept adjusting my feet, and ended up kicking a guy a little).Another one bumped into me at one point because she wasn't holding on well enough (she sort of apologized, but not really).Another fool a few yards away was listening to his music too loud.I'm still comfortable riding on BART, but I have grown weary of certain things.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGXi69UmdeQ"
324,2,"Sep 2, 2011","Except for a 5-year period, I've ridden BART regularly over the past 20 years.+BART is convenient. Nobody likes to be stuck in traffic or deal with bad drivers.  Riding BART also helps the environment.+Unless there's a delay, the trains are pretty quick. Most stops are reached in 2-4 minutes.+If a train is late, it's usually only by 2 minutes. You might be waiting 20 or more minutes for a late bus.+Being at some stations gives me the creeps, but I have always felt safe while on the trains.+It's fairly easy to study or sleep while on a train.+Some hot women ride the SF trains, and a few others ride Richmond and Fremont trains (I didn't mind when this woman brushed against me recently).+/-Clipper cards make it a bit easier to enter and exit a station. It sucks, though, that tickets are no longer being sold at Lucky.+/-You may find yourself sitting on a seat that's been peed on. It's gross.Train floors also tend to be dirty (some riders also leave newspapers behind).On the plus side, I've been to New York and Chicago twice, and riding BART is a tad better than riding the subway. BART trains also look nicer than ""L"" trains.It's also better to ride BART than to be stuck on a bus.+/-Some agents are friendly and helpful, and some aren't.+/-The regulars.It's a drag to see some of the same riders over and over, but there are exceptions.This ""uptight woman"" is attractive and cool (she looks serious all the time, but isn't). I like this woman who reminds me of her too.This blond that I've been seeing lately looks like a Wii character (her face makes me laugh).A guy named Sam looks like a slimmer Randy Jackson, and another guy looks like Michael Wilbon (look him up if you need to- the link I wanted to post took up a ton of space).There's also a girl who looks like Adele, but prettier (I better be careful, or Adele will write a song about me too).+/-Some drivers brake too much (hold on tight if you're standing, or you may bang into someone or fall on the ground), while others are smooth operators (sorry, I couldn't resist).Some of them make too many announcements (shut up, already), while others seem to be mute.He's only been my driver a few times, but this one guy looks and sounds like a hippie. He's awesome.+/-Some of the stations are nice (ex: Union City; San Leandro; Walnut Creek).Others are ghetto (ex: Bay Fair; Coliseum/Oakland Airport; Hayward). -It can be hellish being on a packed train.June 7: I got home late because of the U2 concert at the Oakland Coliseum (my poor sister-in-law missed it because she drove- some other fans considered taking ""legal action"" because of the ""flubbed parking""). When the Fremont train I was on finally cleared out, I got stuck next to some loud Red Sox fans (it was a bizarre night).-In May 2008, an electrical fire occurred at the Hayward yard (it's between the Union City and Hayward stations). Service to 3 stations was disrupted for months. The Fremont and Richmond trains were also more packed than ever during peak hours. It was just a nightmare. The only good thing is that some riders gave up on BART.-Some delays are caused by suicides or accidents (ex: Hayward BART station: ""On October 30, 2010, a man in a wheelchair fell onto the tracks and was hit by a train, dying 2 weeks later from his injuries"").-Gate problems (ex: tickets sometimes get stuck).-There are no late night direct trains to Fremont.-There's no service after midnight on the weekends.  -Ticket prices go up every 2 years, and have been high for 15 years now. -The Fremont and Richmond trains need to be longer during peak hours (9 or 10 cars, not 6-8). I'm tired of being on crowded trains (it's especially bad if you're in a car that's not air conditioned).I sent BART an e-mail 4 years ago, and the response I received was weak.Some changes were made later, but they involved SF trains (they were also lame).-Annoying riders.*Riders on their cell phones (ex: one morning, this frantic woman was pleading with her man not to dump her). Seriously, I don't need to know your business.*Riders listening to music too loud (some fools have boomboxes blasting so that everyone can hear the crappy songs they like). Sadly, most riders are gutless (I was surprised this week when a woman told 2 loud teenagers to be quiet).*Riders soliciting (ex: selling candy; CD's). 16 years ago, I bought a cheap gold chain (I was into them at the time). Just recently, a guy was selling meat pies. Say what?  I'm polite when someone asks, but I really feel like saying, ""No, I don't want to buy your shit.""*Riders just being rude. Lady, move over so that someone else can sit down.Dude, you don't need that much room to read your newspaper. Stop elbowing me.-BART police.The shooting death of Oscar Grant was tragic. There have also been some other incidents involving BART police officers. I still like riding BART overall, but some issues need to be addressed."
327,2,"Nov 18, 2007","I had a lunch date with a friend in Walnut Creek this afternoon.  To get there, I had two choices:1) Hitchhike across the bridge, risking the chance of being thrown in the back of a blue van, bound/gagged, and driven up to Oregon. (No worries, my mom taught me at a young age how to disable tail lights.  She was a little paranoid, so I am also able to slash faces with car keys and know to scream ""fire!"" instead of ""help!"" Yeah, I'm a fun date.)2) Ride the BART. After weighing my options, I chose the latter. On my return trip from Walnut Creek to the Civic Center, I text-messaged myself the following message.  What I should have said to the guy who sat next to me: My seat smells like pee.Quit looking at me.Remove your hand from my back.Sorry yo momma did crack.--End--Well, I guess if this whole finance thing doesn't work out, I can see if Ne-yo still needs help writing lyrics.Wurd."

330,1,"Sep 30, 2007","BART does so many positive things. It stimulates the local economy, boosts the immune system, teaches you time management, and has a few valuable safety lessons hiding in the package it presents to the general public. Let me explain how.....I assume the local economy must be getting a boost because every other major city I have been to with a public transit system is less expensive. Maybe the money is going to the high paid officials but I can only assume that they spend money, so hooray for all of us public transportation takers funding their fine dining and luxury goods habits. You clearly have to be building up your immune system when you are exposed to the multitude of germs crusted onto the upholstered seats that have not been cleaned since 1972, when BART first opened.You have to have a good sense of time management to make sure you make the last BART train back to where you came from by midnight. Forget the fact that you will have to leave all of your friends who are still having a good time, this is about responsibility, damnit! Safety lesson #1. If you are standing at a BART station make sure you are very aware of your surroundings, because security is not present most of the time. Safety lesson #2. Learn that if you want to stay out past 11:30 it is important not to drink with your friends. You will need to drive home, an activity best tackled sober.Safety lesson #3. Some people will not adhere to safety lesson #2, so be a very careful driver, lest a drunk person ram you off the road. Yep, thanks BART for really stepping up and being there for us. You are the BEST!!!!"
331,3,"May 18, 2007","My BART ride was short enough that I stayed awake on BART usually, but long enough that I thought.  A lot.  And that's with the iPod going.I have a lot of revelations and thoughts about life, the world, existence, yadda yadda yadda...Don't get me wrong, coming from a state that has only one form of public transit *cough*TheBus*cough*, it's very fast, it's efficient, and it's USUALLY on time.  HOWEVERThe worst realization to have while sitting on BART:""They don't actually....*wash* the seats...do they.""Funny how much denial your brain can be in for a couple of months.  This is what it progressed from.""I'm sure they clean these seats. I mean just because I don't see it doesn't mean it doesn't happen""Turned into""So they walk up and down the aisles and pick up paper. I hope that's not all they do.""Which eventually, after a couple of months, has finally turned into.""No. They don't actually wash the seats.""and then of course the further epiphany that would make my Art History prof proud:""Now I know why that one guy stands all the way from Millbrae to the East Bay."""
332,3,"Feb 20, 2010",I am not a fan of public transportation except in New York or Tokyo.It was a little confusing at first but you get used to it.  Just be careful not to miss your exit.  I did =P  And make sure you take the right train.  I took the wrong one =P   Buying the ticket was a little confusing.  Okay I messed up when I bought the ticket too =P  Take the taxi if you don't want to take BART.BART EZ Rider is cheap and convenient.
333,2,"Jul 22, 2011","I was torn between giving BART two or three stars, and I decided to give it two, because although it has gotten me to work on time almost every day for the past year (only late twice because of BART), I have a few complaints about BART.   As plenty of reviewers have mentioned, the seats and the trains with carpeting are FILTHY!  There was an article that came out a few months ago about a scientist from SFSU who tested the seats on the seats and found NINE types of bacteria lurking there, including MRSA.  Oh, and she said some of those bacteria are there because she found fecal material as well.  WOW.  This is why when I fall asleep on BART I never, ever, ever put my head back on the seat.  And even when it's super hot in there, I refuse to take my jacket off so my bare skin doesn't touch the seats or the armrests.  I am also getting sick of the broken escalator situation, specifically at the Civic center station.  Really?  The escalator up to street level was out for almost a month, and the down escalator going to the trains is currently broken and has been for over month.  I pay $10.60 round trip every day.  300,000 people use BART every day.  Where is all that money going?  Clearly it's not going to cleaning the seats or repair and maintenance of the stations.  Oh, I forgot to mention, the Monday after Gay Pride weekend, the Civic Center station was a freaking MESS at 6:30am.  There was garbage everywhere and the floors were disgusting.  You'd think after an event like that they would have had a crew working all night to clean up the aftermath.Although I am grateful to have the option to take BART to work and the Bay area really is very lucky to have a transit system that reaches far and wide and is quite convenient, I wish they would invest more time and energy into upkeep of the trains and the stations.Now after writing this review I need to go disinfect the shoes I wore yesterday and wash my jacket."
334,3,"May 27, 2008","If my BART train were a girl she would be a dirty little whore.A dirty little whore I'd do once in the morning and once in the evening but never on weekends.  She can sometimes smell funny and take too long.The worst is when she is late because shes usually always on time.I share her with thousands of other people.  I love and hate you.Davids bottom line:I take bart from Fremont to Embarcadero and back every weekday.  It gets me to work and it beats dealing with traffic.  Yeah it can be sticky, smelly, and full of ghetto ass people....but what good whore isnt?  BART is dirty if you want nice take Caltrain.Oh and an observation...and please oh please I swear im not racist...just lazy and always scheming for a seat... most of the Indian people live in the southern area of the east bay...meaning if the train is full from SF and you are waiting for a seat....you should wait near the black, hispanic, white, asian people because they tend to get off sooner.  Okay that sounds completely racist huh?"
335,2,"Mar 5, 2009","Right after college, I dated a guy named Bart.  I met him when I was waiting tables, I believe his friend lured me over with the promise of a palm reading.  I read more than Bart's palm.  As cute as Bart was, and as sweet as he could be at times, it was just not meant to be.  Bart didn't respect me.  He didn't really take me out, he didn't call when he said he was going to...basically he was like 90% of the guys I've dated.  Why I continue to do this to myself, I will never know.Riding BART is a lot like dating.  It can be uncomfortable, disappointing, and can make you mad.An 8 car train during rush hour when it's raining is just bad judgment.  Kind of like my dating life."

We all know it's because she is chronically late and doesn't want to get caught by our boss, who really doesn't like her.  So she continues to break the rules like a high schooler, and we continue to laugh behind her back at her lack of originality, really bad makeup application, and need for a little nice 'n easy for the grey roots.Much like my coworker who sneaks by my boss, there is a plethora of jerkoffs who think it's okay to bring their bikes on the train during peak hours, as long as it's in the last car.  It's not okay, and your fat ass and stupid bike are not allowing enough room for me and my tiny little person to stand without getting grease on myself.Ass munch.Hey BART, enforce your own rules.

We used to have such a good thing going, BART and I. Now all I can think about when I'm riding back and forth from the city is germs. Damn it! BART, we are going to get past this, I know it! But for now, you go down a star in my book. But don't worry, I'm not going anywhere just yet."
338,4,"Jan 16, 2010","Considering the fact that I hail from a city that rarely uses public transit, BART is pretty darn awesome. I would agree that the aesthetics leave something to be desired, but the actual service is great! Landed at SFO and was given instructions by friends (who've been here before) to just hop on and it'd be easy to figure out from there. Well, it'd be easy for someone who can read a map. But it wasn't a big problem, as I just asked a very nice transit employee and he indicated which stop would be mine. The STL Metro folks are not this helpful. Or clean!For $8.60 (compared to probably a $40 cab ride), BART got me to my destination, no problem. My only complaint is that I had to lug my suitcase up several flights of stairs once I got to my stop, as the escalators were out of order. Damn! That was definitely my workout for the week... And I decided to take a cab from BART to my hotel, as I my sense of direction is lacking and I didn't want to wander around SOMA with a giant pink suitcase :)When I return to San Fran in a few weeks, I will take BART again fo sho!"
341,2,"Nov 6, 2014","The overall condition of the bart trains and their stations are ok...but than again you have thousands of people riding the bart everyday, you are bound to see some wear and tear. Also you will see all types of people, from all walks of life, so can't be very picky to point out that the seats are dirty or that there is a bit of trash on the floor. But I do have a bone to pick and that's with some of the personnel working for BART. I'm not an avid bart rider so when I politely ask a question please be civil enough to respond with a polite answer!!! And have the respect to at least look at me when talking. I have encoutered multiple rude people (bart staff). Obviously if I'm asking you a question it's because I don't know the answer to it...no need to be rude. I understand you have to deal with a massive amount of people on a daily basis but like I said..I WASN'T RUDE TO YOU. HIRE NICER PEOPLE...wish I could review them individually."
342,4,"Oct 14, 2014","Wowza at some of the more negative reviews, since maybe I got lucky and got a good impression of the system during my San Francisco spring trip? Ah well.My impression was that the system was pretty clean, cleaner than the 'L(Chicago's subway), and just about all the employees I dealt with were friendly, including the worker at San Francisco Airport station that showed me how to use the ticket machine. Inside of the cars always felt clean to me, and I can believe older reviews that the seats must've been refurbished on the vast majority of cars within the last 2-3 years. Since I didn't once encounter a dirty seat, and I think I can safely assume you should not take as seriously the much older reviews about the cleanliness inside the railcars, before 2011 or 2012.Maybe one day the system will be 24/7, since that's an unfortunate negative to an otherwise great system. I'm not bothered by the varied distance fares either(rather than flat fare regardless of how little or far you ride), since I know that helps to pay for the cost of this system. Something makes me think the claim that 'the system has to shut down on overnights to do maintenance/etc.', but if other systems can run 24/7 and run less frequent service, that they could still get away with some sort of very minimum service(like every 20-30 minutes?).Ranting aside about the lack of overnight service, I'd totally be comfortable with riding BART again, whenever I return to San Francisco. It did allow me to do a trip over to the University of California-Berkeley's campus, and to and from SFO airport after all."
343,5,"Mar 5, 2008","When I think about going to the airport, I instantly get a headache. I'm sure this has to do with the fact that having lived in LA all my life, the two main options were Burbank (easy peasy) or HELL-AX (um, does that name need any further descriptions to get the point across??). Now with that preconceived panic attack waiting to happen, it was no surprise to me yesterday while waking up at 6am, that I was a little anxious about taking the MUNI to the BART to SFO for the first time.The MUNI was easy since I take that into work and I know the drill there. The BART however, well, I'm still kind of a newb. But I got off the MUNI at Montgomery and paid my $5.45 fair for a ticket to SFO and then headed downstairs with big ole over-packed suitcase in tow and looked for travel clues. I spotted a map and realized that this was going to be easier than i thought. It was just one train, sweet!I then grabbed a seat and people watched until the SFO BART whizzed up and on I got. From there, well, from there, I didn't have to use my brain once. Do you realize what a luxury that feeling is at 8am. i don't know about you, but my brain doesn't wake up til more like 10:30am, so this was a true treat. The total trip took maybe 30-35 minutes and I didn't have to deal with directions, off ramps, traffic or anything. And it was only $5.45.I swear, this city is getting cooler by the day! Oakland airport, who?"
344,5,"Jun 24, 2006","Thank you Mister BART for saving me from a $60 cab ride into the city from Oakland. Thank you for being clean and safe feeling. Thank you. And if you have any friends of power in LA, please call them and tell them to bring you down to LA, because you seriously rock and we need you!"
345,1,"Oct 20, 2013","Come on BART unions, REALLY? You came to terms about money, pension and everything else, but you don't like the ""work rules"", so you stomp your little hooves, take your ball and go home to pout? Do you have any idea just how many people who have been unemployed/underemployed would APPRECIATE your working conditions, compensation and benefits and actually come to work with a great attitude? Personally, I think that a little union-busting is way past-due.I must admit to a little BART bias, dating back to when I still lived in SF. I still haven't forgotten the lovely station agent at Civic Center from several years ago who ignored the thug who mugged me right in front of her little kiosk, then got snotty when the BART police asked her to give me a ticket to get home and she refused, telling me, ""Just because you lost your money and can't afford a ticket isn't MY problem.""  A Muni agent DID give a pass to get home when she came over to see if she could help, which gave the ""compassionate"" BART station agent an even worse attitude.There are more BART employees getting fed up with union ""leadership"" each and every day, who don't WANT to be on strike. How come the ""leadership"" doesn't put it out to the members for a vote?"
346,1,"Aug 4, 2013","Dear BART Unions:Here we go again, you greedy bastards. You are demanding a 23% raise and you want to contribute less to your already fantastic medical coverage? REALLY?  Your BART riders have, for the most part, taken HUGE hits in hours worked, many working for far less money than just a few years ago (myself included), and medical coverage contributions (if fortunate enough to have them) are unaffordable for many, or eat up as much as a third of take-home pay for those with families.Because of your little hissy fit, traffic will be a nightmare to the nth degree, many people will again have to decide between buying food or paying ridiculously jacked-up parking fees in San Francisco (to be jacked up even higher by some of the opportunistic parasites who run these parking garages and public lots..never let a good crisis go to waste). Some people may not be able to get to work, period., especially the people who can least afford it.Oh, but BART is making money, so they should give you guys what you want? At what cost? It already is not cheap to take public transit from the East Bay into parts of San Francisco. Who in the hell do you think the cost of your overinflated salaries and benefits are paid for by? The very people you are screwing over who are barely making it.Since you are going to inconvenience everyone, at least earn your strike pay. During the last one, I saw more of you at BART stations sitting on bus benches texting and talking on your cell phones than I actually saw on the picket line, especially at the Del Norte stations..not to mention the lines of you in the Starbucks in Safeway across the street."
347,2,"Jun 28, 2013","Dear BART Unions:As much as I would like to be sympathetic, I just can't.  When your employees make an average of nearly 80k a year plus benefits in times that are hard economically for many of your riders, it is impossible to feel sorry for you.Do you realize or even care what kind of impact your little hissy fit may have on many of your riders? In this day of many people working reduced hours as it is, you will basically be robbing this people. Those who do have cars will get to sit in traffic for hours, burn $4.00+ a gallon gas, pay bridge tolls they ordinarily don't have to pay, and if they are extremely lucky, find parking that will not sap their food budget for the week. What about those people who don't own a vehicle? Do you think AC (if they don't join your hissy fit) can accommodate everyone? Oh, they can take the ferry? Yep, that's cheap, huh? Not to those who are barely making it as it is.Please stop the PR campaign claiming that you would be striking for the safety of BART passengers. The reality is, it is all about you and lining the union coffers."
348,2,"Jan 6, 2009","Ok, so I like that the bay area at least HAS a rapid transit program. And I've seen some seriously entertaining moments on the various trains. And some seriously disturbing moments. However. The BART service in SF is so limited, that you can't even begin to compare it to Boston's MBTA or New York City's subway network. BART can get you to SF's embarcadero, financial district, downtown center, and the mission. If you want to go anywhere else in the city, be prepared to extend your travel time significantly as you navigate the Muni trains (which are chillingly notorious for running down pedestrians) or the bus system. Yes, you can get to the games and concerts in Oakland. Yes, it's probably great for commuters who truck into the city from Livermore, Richmond, and Pittsburg. However, as a public train that tries to boast the most convenient coverage around...I can't get behind it. I know I sound like a curmudgeon, but I have a love/hate relationship with the BART system. I am also irritated that they splash around advertising as an alternative to driving when going into the city on weekends. When I have dinner at a friend's house, I don't want to feel pressured to get back to the station by 12am. When I'm out dancing or drinking (or both), I don't want to be constantly sweating whether or not I'm going to wind up footing a $60 cab ride back across the bay. I know times are tight, and I'm sure there isn't a huge populous just waiting to work the night shift at BART...but I think it would drastically reduce the percentage of DUIs in the bay area if they did. And speaking of times being tight, what the hell is up with your constantly raising fares?  I see no difference in scheduling or cleanliness of the trains or stations, but still the ridiculous fare hikes.  Not accounting for parking, it is actually cheaper to DRIVE into the city from Oakland than it is to take BART.  So what gives?  Knock it off!  Talk about reducing the incentive for people to take public transit.And carpeting on public transit? That's just a bad idea. Alright. I'm done. Call me an asshole and call it a day. Re-reading this review I realize what a complete jerkoff I sound like - so please enjoy this before I regain my senses and delete it."
349,4,"Oct 11, 2017","I love BART. It gets me where I need to be. It's convenient. I can take my bike anytime. I love watching and experiencing the unique, special diverse cultural style of the SF Bay Area."
350,5,"Aug 4, 2009","So I was watching The Simpsons one Sunday night, and Lisa was preparing to go on this crossword challenge competition. She was learning words left and right in a dictionary until she came across BART. Her response: ""A rapid transit system serving the San Francisco Bay Area. Also the name of my annoying little brother!"" I loved it! :-)Anyways, BART has been my lifeline back when I was growing up in Antioch and when I was living in the city. In fact, I commuted every other day on BART during the summer of '05 when I was newly hired as a lab assistant for a biotech company in South San Francisco. Yay for being able to relax, sleep and read like 10 books that summer during my commute. My only gripe: parking at Pittsburg! If you get there too late during the morning, parking is pretty much nonexistent until 10AM rolls around and you're able to park in the carpool only section. That's my word of wisdom for ya."
351,4,"Aug 25, 2007","Lets face it people...BART IS DIRTY. The blue seats and carpet PROBABLY HAVEN'T BEEN CLEANED since they were installed 15+ years ago. Trust me on this, I remember when this happened. It was a refreshing thing at the time, considering the mucky brown dirty seats/carpet they had previously installed. At least those mucky brown seats CAMOUFLAGED all the dirt and stains. Nowadays, it's the DIRT and STAINS that CREATE a camouflage pattern on the seats.And quite honestly, I hate having to take public transportation. It can get quite GHETTO, especially in San Francisco. I'll admit... I'm spoiled, with a car. Can you blame me if my ass prefers to sit on leather seats rather than dirty, stain infested seats compliments of our local government?So I only take public transportation if I need to, like when I don't have my car because it's in the shop (like it was this past week) or when I have to go downtown to work, because I can't park downtown and pay $25 bucks a day for parking.That's just ludicrous. Anyways, I digress.HOWEVER, I have recently acquired a new found respect for BART. Why? You ask...It is EFFING FAST!AND it is reliable, runs on time LIKE CLOCKWORK without breaking down, creating a delay or backup on the rails. Unlike MUNI, which is a joke.So this past week, a coworker (who explained to me how quickly we could get from the Embarcadero station and into the Mission) and I took a quick joyride on BART during our lunch break and over to 25th and Mission to have our tacos at La Taqueria with PLENTY of time to sit down and eat, then hop next door to Dianda's for a slice of cake and back to work in 59 MINUTES!5 stars for being like a good one night stand, FAST AND EASY and for letting me have my cake and eating it too! Now, THAT'S how i like it!Minus 1 star for making me go home feeling dirty and like I have to wash my hands and dry clean my clothes every time I ride it. Like a bad one night stand. But then again, sometimes a girl NEEDS TO FEEL DIRTY every now and then."

353,3,"Jul 10, 2009","I like BART.  I don't love it.  It's limited and it's expensive for what it offers.  When I've returned from trips to Boston I've been angry at how few places BART goes in comparison to the T, which covers the Boston area, going to myriad museums and university campuses.  It's been several years since we've been to Boston though, so I'm no longer feeling that anger.  We use BART in a very limited way, mostly to go to San Francisco to the theatre, and for that it works well.  This past couple of weeks we've taken it several times and it has been undeniably convenient.  For us it's mostly a way to go into the eastern part of the city and play, although a few times we've taken it to and from SFO, and that's been terrific.  The airport BART station is clean and convenient."
356,1,"Apr 19, 2018","Bart Police can be found roaming the parking lot looking to hand out tickets; while homeless do drugs and defecate on the train and throughout the subway. It's ""gross negligence"" as it's finest. Bart Police would rather take your money than protect you. It's California though, what did you expect? Recently, I had a homeless man smoke crack inside the Bart car, and when I brought it up to security, he laughed at me and stated ""Bart police are supposed to ride the train but don't""...It's not going to be so funny when something real happens and you get hit with a lawsuit.

Mngmt spent big buck$$$ for union/contract negotiations - including a 'humble' lawyer who billed BART for max.amount up to $400K and even for his alcohol expenses at the hotel...BART overpriced the trip to SFO airport with the idea: if they can afford to fly, they can afford to pay extra for SFO ride. So now, the cost from San Bruno to SFO - a one stop, 5-min ride is $7.40 (used to be about $3.80). That's the most oligarchic calculation ever. For comparison, a 50-minute trip from Berkeley to SFO costs $9.25. Pythagoras, please don't be offended and don't turn around in your grave. Is BART a public transit company whose mission is to serve or slave people?I will rather ride a sustainably raised cow than Bay-Area-Ridiculous-Transit."

But more than 30 years down the road, you haven't evolved much.  Yeah, you've got new stations here and there, but those dumbass destination signs go on the fritz so frequently, it's fun watching all these people scratch their heads and panic after they get on the wrong train (nevermind that your typical rider wouldn't dare approach someone else and TALK to them, god). And you spent a bajillion building a way to get up close and personal with SFO (we all know that airport passengers account for like 75% of your riders, right?).  Oh, ya -- forward thinking for that Bay Area loop you keep dreaming about, and should that miracle ever come to fruition, it will cost US twice what the new Bay Bridge span is.  Then it will cost the average citizen $15 to take an average round trip in the Bay Area. You're backwards and adolescent, BART.  Expensive, spend thrift, can't get your priorities straight, and ill-mannered to some of your biggest allies in the movement to reduce carbon emissions on a daily basis (um, that would be cyclists).  Do something so my 2-wheelin brothers and sisters don't get their rides jacked at your stations, and can take their rides in the stations trains ANY time of the day so they can complete their travels.  And quit you're ""don't do this"" and ""ya can't do that"" and ""shouldn't be doin' that"" bullshit.  Bikes on board *aren't* toys, OK... unlike half the shit people are hauling in those suitcases they put on the chairs where PEOPLE should be sitting.  Again with the airport passenger bunch. I have fond memories of an emergency situation that arose in San Francisco some years ago during the Bay Area's last humong-o power outtage.  I was stuck in the transbay tube on the way to SF in a train so packed, that all the techie-pros on board didn't even have enough elbow room to reach for their mobiles (which would never have worked back then anyway).  We were in that tunnel, immobile for 1 hour and 35 minutes, with ONE lame ass announcement made about ""Oh the power's out in the Embarcadero station, and we're trying to move a train out of the way"".  We were less than 500 feet from the station, you imbecile.  Wouldn't it have been at the very least courteous to offer an evacuation? Despite your hefty cover charge, you're always complaining that you're broke, can't pay your bills, or owe too much on your credit card.

360,4,"Jul 20, 2013","I've had nothing but positive experiences with BART. Not living in the bay area, I've really only had occasion to take it for special occasions/event - most notably, to A's and Giants games (usually BARTing in from the Dublin/Pleasanton station), and once to get to SF for Bay to Breakers. SUPER convenient to The Coliseum. Side note: does anyone else use BART as a verb? In a sentence: ""We parked our car in Fremont, BARTed in to Oakland, and made it to the game in no time."" We had a couple of very nice young men help us (me, Husband, PickyEater and her two small kids) find our way to the correct train one night after we had jumped on the wrong one after a late A's game. Community love!The time I BARTed in to do B2B, we parked our car at the Concord station to go in just for the day. It was around the buttcrack of dawn and thus hadn't anticipated a crowd, but to our surprise the train was packed. That early morning, we all rode to San Francisco together: a group of adults, most wearing silly costumes, (myself included), all sharing the same quiet, sleepy excitement. It was actually kinda awesome. Thanks for that memory, BART.VERDICT: YUP! If you need to get to the bay, give it a try for sure! Make sure you read the map and figure out where you need to go. Just, ah... try not to touch stuff. I def wouldn't want to take a black light to those cloth seats or poles."
361,3,"Jan 15, 2008","K, I have a love/hate relationship with BART. I've been riding BART since I was about nine. Yes, I said nine,  yes, it was safe to let your kids travel on public transportation in the late 70's/early 80's. When I worked in the city, it was my primary commuting option. NO,  I will not pay $25/day for parking (circa mid 90s) to park in the Embarcadero when I can get to work for $5 on BART. So why only three stars? Well, I have a history (see review for Royal Exchange) of having my friends (well that's what I call them) dump me on BART after a evening/afternoon/morning of drinking. Granted some of my drunken rides are a lot less dramatic then others. Let me tell you about the night I got on BART after a day on the Bay with Bay Quackers (see review). After being plied with margaritas and not much food, my non-Yelp friend, who will rename nameless, dumped me on BART! Thank goodness this nice prostitute befriended me and was helpful enough to guide me home. I had embarked at the Embarcadero station, traveling in the wrong direction towards Burlingame. Thankfully my newly made ""friend"" was headed to the East Bay because if it weren't for her, I'd probably still be lost in the Peninsula somewhere. Anyways, she was really sweet, and helped direct me onto the correct east bound Richmond train. And the sweetheart, god bless her short skirt and low cut top, was so generous, she told me if I went back to her place to meet her Pimp, he would be happy to drive me home. Alas, I was drunk and ornery, and (luckily) refused to transfer trains again. So thanks BART for decades of helping me traverse the Bay Area and meeting new friends."

I have no time to type out the top 50 reasons of why I am miserable commuting on this train that either smells like weed, urine, or vomit depending on the time of day. You know why I have no time?

365,4,"Jun 3, 2009","Bay Area Rapid Transit aka, BART exceeds MUNI in almost every way. Almost because they are experiencing a gradually worsening cleanliness problem.I'll address that first. The uncleanliness isn't really as much litter from food or drinks, but soiling from you probably don't want to know what. Due to budget constraints, BART has cut back on custodial staffing, thereby exasperating the situation. Their peddling Peet's Coffee at several stations & considering allowing drinks on the trains (provided you use their shoddy, poorly designed ""spill-proof"" mugs) will not help things.On the bright side, BART is mostly on schedule (unlike MUNI, they actually HAVE a schedule, not an ""estimate""). And unlike MUNI, their operators (they don't like the term driver) seem to actually grasp the notion of customer service & convenience. For instance, they try to connect you, ala SF-bound trains waiting for transfers at McArthur Station after direct trains stop running.A MUNI driver will more likely make SURE you do not connect. Seriously. Although BART plans to raise fares yet again, it'll still be cheaper for a tourist (or non Fast Pass holder) tp ride from Embarcadero Station to Civic Center Station after both transit systems' proposed rate increases. Yes, it'll cost more to ride MUNI than BART for the same distance. BART provides their own police who hold full police powers. Some stations along their routes are visual sights. Examples are the SFO  & Millbrae Stations."

370,3,"Aug 14, 2006","God, where do I start. 1.) I take serious issue with the magnetized ticketing system imposed by BART. While thankfully in the last 5 years they have discovered something known to most of us as a credit card, they are still behind the times. Regular users should get a key chain transponder. No, I'm serious, just like fasTrak you should have an online account and a little thingy that beeps when you walk past. It should be attachable to your keys or purse just to make digging in your bag and therefore exposing yourself to robbery a thing of the past. Also, we could hook it into MUNI and the SF Buses and AC transit. WOW, what a thought! 2.) Bart, I don't care if you list 10 bazillion reasons why you can't run on the weekends late, but whatever they are, they are dumb or a cover for the fact that your union is twisting your arm. Frankly, I think SF cities need to pass a law that says public transportation needs to be open until 3 on Friday and Saturday nights. The fact that people still need to drive after drinking is freaking retarded. Anyone want to start getting signatures? 3.) Your computer system is ridiculous. Who thought of the idea of having a finite number of trains. When you installed the SFO stop, the trains now have to LITERALLY switch over to a new system. Don't you guys plan ahead? I honestly can't believe you didn't think of getting new computers before now. I'm telling you, you pay your drivers too much if this is why. 4.) I am uber annoyed by stupid jerks standing in the way of the doors. I personally like the new marking system you have, but you need to do a better job or clearly stating what travel etiquette is. Also, have some staff at the platforms during rush hour to make Barters behave. I know, police state, but pushing and shoving is just stupid. (You assholes know who you are). 5.) I honestly think 511transit.org trip planner is really really annoying.  Why the heck can't you see where the address of the various Bart tunnels are? A map included in the interactive system would sure be nice. Ever heard of using google? I mean, what if you need a pick up. Or don't know where you are going to be. So dumb that I have to google it.

Even though you share the same name as one of my idols growing up (Bart Simpson) I gotta compare you to the CTA in Chi-town which you fall very short of. While your pretty convienient,,and much cleaner than the majority of other mass transit systems your still just a mass transit system. What gives you the right to charge damn near 10 bucks to get me from SFO to the Powell street stop? Why can't you just charge a one time fare and let me ride you until the cows come home. Why do you have to be a public transit snob. BART huh?"
373,2,"Dec 1, 2009","I will pay more and use BART more regularly, if it gets rid of cloth seating. It's really disgusting. After a friend saw human fecal matter on a seat covered with newspaper, I don't sit, unless I'm in pain or suffering extreme exhaustion. When I do take a seat, I wash my hands and change my clothes as soon as I get home. Granted, I'm a bit sensitive to germs, but the cloth seats and carpets are gross gross gross!BART also needs to invest in building a parking lot for the popular stations in East Bay. I would actually take BART everyday to work, if I could get a monthly parking pass at the nearest BART station. Unfortunately, MacArthur and Rockridge stations are both sold out. Taking a bus to BART isn't really a viable option, since it will add another 20 - 30 min to my commute.I do give  BART credit for extending to Millbrae where Caltrain transfer is possible. Now, if only they could time the transfers better, I would actually be able to transfer. I've had to sprint from BART to Caltrain and nearly miss the Caltrain too many times. If you have to stop and buy a Caltrain ticket or if you are unable to run, then you would surely miss the transfer.It's terribly outdated, but it's still the most reliable and fastest transportation method we have in the Bay Area. How sad."

375,2,"Sep 19, 2019","Since my first BART comment 5 years ago they have made no significant improvement at existing stations that are obviously in need of improvement.  Since BART is losing customers because of these items they say it has their attention. The train is often like a rolling homeless camp,  no improvement.  The stations have very limited security in terms of either security lights or security people, no improvement.  They did a big advertising campaign to say they will crack down on fare evaders, no improvement.  Many regular folks are scared to park and ride at the existing stations so no wonder the customer drop-off.   Of course, this has been a long time with no major action so I am expecting BART will want a tax increase or fare raise to offset their shrinking revenue instead of just getting to work at the stations. I give it a two rating rather than one just because it is still a better option then our miserable freeway situation."
376,3,"Oct 22, 2014","I am liking the improvement in cleanliness,  but there is still a ways to go.  I have lived in Oakland 35 years and the only rip-off I have encountered has been having a bike stolen from BART stations.  First at West Oakland station, then Rockridge station.  West Oakland is just one stop to the financial district,  Rockridge is full of million dollar homes.  I think BART should have a security guard and cleaning person at all major urban stations like these.  Around the world at major transit stations you see these attendants,  you usually see only one attendant here.  I will be a bit generous and give them a three since the rest of the service seems to be functioning better."
377,3,"Nov 28, 2013",I have noticed a few more security on the platforms and trains so this is moving in the right direction and I have raised my rating.  However the parking lots need the same attention.  If my local bank who hardly gets any customers can afford a security guard standing outside then BART with all these passengers with money and needs parking in the lots especially at West Oakland station should be able to afford an improvement.  I think a pleasant security guard would bring an increase in business also.

Visit your local BART station around midnight and see how often people get stuck. Talk to your east bay friends and ask why they drove to that bar in the city, knowing they would become intoxicated and have to drive back.Drunk drivers and BART. Connect the dots.If BART needs to close all night ""for maintenance"", then it's time to consider optional maintenance routines. Run less often after midnight, alternate tracks. Run late on Friday and start later on Saturday. Find a solution. 40 years is too long.As a bonus, an adult's hearing is damaged at 85dB. Noise level for children should go no higher than 35dB.

I had just moved to Berkeley and needed to find a way to get to San Francisco everyday for work so that I would stop hearing those voices in my head on the Bay Bridge chanting ""everyone must die"" during my 90 minute commute.  I must admit, you intimidated me at first.  I mean what was I supposed to think when I heard the stories about how you so stealthily move about the dark underground like a massive metal rat, even fearlessly diving deep underwater from time to time without missing a beat!  But after all the time we have spent together I have gotten to know the real you and I wouldn't be a good friend if I didn't make you aware of several major flaws in your seemingly well built system:  1) Your stations smell like urine and feces2) You are not bike friendly 3) Your interior is filthy and disgusting4) You poop out at 12:20, I go all nightAlthough these defects make our relationship a bit rocky from time to time, they won't stop me from sliding my debit card into your waiting slot and gently tapping my private numeric combination onto your slick metal buttons so that I can ride you.  Of course if you really love me you will work on these things.  Because you never know when a better option may come along and sweep me off my feet.  Then my dear BART, you can kiss my ass goodbye - if you're lucky."

(mainly because if you're innocent these days there is really something wrong with you)My sixteenth birthday my bestest friend and I lied to our VERY strict and protective parents and told them we were going to the library.  Instead we went on BART and into the big and dangerous city to watch a movie. Eraser.  Who knew Arnold would be the gubernator? Who new that Vanessa Williams would age so badly?We went back to BART and this man with a duffel bag began to stare at us. He was so creepy....like Chester the Molester creepy.  The train came and we got in.  So did he.  He sat facing us and staring with his bag on his lap. At the next stop I grabbed my friend and we ran off the train and up the escalators to the bathrooms.  We sat in the bathroom for about 15 minutes thinking that he would have left the station when he didn't find us. We got out and were about to go back down onto the platform to go home but then we saw him coming up the escalator. Instead to went to the phones and called my friends older sister.  The guy saw us and stood at the end of the wall and stared at us.  So while we waited for her sister to come we spoke to her whole family on the phone for about 20 minutes.  The WHOLE time getting stared at by the creepy guy with the duffel bag. side note: The BART attendant was NOT intimidating at all.  He was a small indifferent man...I new he wouldn't care if I told him some creepy guy was following us.Her two sisters finally arrive!  They are both tiny women but one came with an industrial screw driver!  She walked RIGHT THROUGH the gate with NO WORD from the BART attendant!  TWO WOMEN with a big ass construction site screwdriver and NOTHING!!  Way to go asshat!!  He did even look our way when she went up to the creepy guy and began to yell at him for harassing two young girls!  This is the creepiest part.  The guy stood there still as stone and just kept staring at the two of us as she yelled at him.  No expression at all. We left and went home.  Scared and hella in trouble. BART still gets five stars because it has served me my entire life.  Even if I did get stalked, hit on, spit on, left behind and stuck in a tunnel on BART...I still love it."

390,1,"Sep 28, 2011","Ugh, I despise BART.1)  It's DISGUSTING.  The trains are old and ghetto; the cloth seats are revolting and stained and constantly emitting the combined stench of piss, puke, and farts; it appears that nobody ever cleans the damn things.  I just got back from London and rode the Tube there a LOT....so I know that it IS possible to keep cloth seats clean because none of the Tube seats were all that gross.  2)  It doesn't go everywhere in the city.  Just one straight line from the south end to the Embarcadero basically.  So if you want to get to, say, Golden Gate Park, you've gotta think of something else.  I hate public transportation and draw the line at BART, so what other options there are, I don't know.3)  It shuts down too early on the weekends.  It's like they're saying ""Hey guys, how about you drive drunk??""  BART stops running before the bars close.  Maybe that's their lame attempt at reducing puke on the trains, but it sucks because if you miss your train, you're looking at one hell of a hefty taxi fare to get home if you live on the peninsula or something.  A cab ride to my old place in SSF from the city was like $50 -- now that I live in Half Moon Bay, I don't even want to know what that would cost me.4)  Did I mention how gross it is?  I always feel like I need a shower after riding BART.  5)  Seriously, CLEAN THE DAMN TRAINS.[end rant]"
391,2,"Mar 23, 2011","Man, I have so many complaints about the BART system.  First of, WHY oh WHY are the seats made of CLOTH?!  They stink of bum piss, puke, body odor, etc....so disgusting.  You can see grease-stains on the tops of the seat-backs where dirty people have rested their heads/necks.  They should call it BARF, not BART.  Seriously guys, take a cue from other cities with better public transportation systems -- use plastic seats that are easier to clean and less likely to raise healthy thriving colonies of fecal bacteria!!  Did anyone see that news article about the culture tests they ran on the BART seats?  Absolutely horrifying.  Fecal bacteria is just the beginning of it.Next, the trains are SO LOUD.  I guess there isn't much they can do about that though....right?  I'm not a mechanical engineer so I have no clue.Last, I wish BART ran later, at least on the weekends.  Seriously, anyone who's done the drunken ankle-busting foot-race along Market Street trying to find the one station that's still open so you don't have to cough up $50 for a cab ride to SSF on a Saturday night should feel me on this.  BART has the potential to prevent a LOT of DUI's and drunken-driving attempts if it would operate until say 2:30-3:00am on weekends.  I don't understand why something like that isn't a priority to the city.On the positive side (yes I CAN be objective, sheesh), it's cheap and easy (hey kinda like my sister).  As for the SSF station specifically, it's nice & big and relatively clean.  Easy to navigate, and the parking is pretty convenient.  I got all indignant when they introduced the paid-parking thing, but I've calmed down now after learning that doesn't apply to evenings & weekends.  It's cool."

US! what i want from BART is:more elevators closer to the entrances and exits from the station. and elevators down to BART from the street - along Market there are two i know of. signs directing people to elevators when the escalators are down. i use a cane; and when the elevators are out i have to walk all the way down the other side of the station to get an elevator. DAMN!! i have had my say, i do it all the time. BART has no one to answer to, so they get away with whatever they want to.and how about the station agents - and the constant punitive announcements over the loud speakers. do this, do that or else or it will cost you. and the piercing loud speakers in some of the trains. and what is it with these cheesy, incredibly uncomfortable new Vinyl seats. they are horrible, what happened to the comfortable blue seats? these need to be changed."

Would you rather be hanging off the side by one arm, with a pair of live chickens under the other? What do you expect, caviar and wine with your smelly blue seat. Oh boo hoo, it's too noisy? Buy a damn pair of earplugs. Oh wahhh, it doesn't pick you up at your doorstep? It's an inter-city transit system, not MUNI. Get your head out of your ass, you uneducated imbecile.I have this to say about certain patrons though: if you sit there blasting your ultra-shitty tunes through your even shittier phone speaker, bobbing your greasy unwashed head like an inexperienced porn star, I sincerely hope karma punches you square in the face.Also, the workers' union sucks sweaty balls."

And that's not even taking into account all the tweekers, pseudo pan handlers and weirdos that also fill the trains daily.  Work is bad enough but having to see these people before I get there just makes things that much worse.  The conditions in some trains towards the back seats are borderline unsanitary.  Might as well call the end seats masturbators row.  Who was the genius who thought carpeting heavily trafficked trains and fitting the seats with fabric was a good idea?  Urine and cum don't stain plastic, hello!  In the afternoons the bums seem to disappear and instead you get shoulder to shoulder trains full of people who hate their jobs.  I can handle that, at least you won't get lice from the business man or woman that you're sardined next to.  Not to mention traveling outside of SF proper on BART is more expensive than driving.

Seats with questionable stains.  Some cars have a new cleanable ""vinyl"" instead of the old fabric seats (!).  I doubt they sanitize the newer vinyl seats anyways.  When there are delays, it is insane.  The BART system should have in a place a better contingency plan for these ""medical emergencies;"" these seem to happen every week!  I'm sure some are legitimate, and need dire attention, but If there is a medical emergency get the person off the train if possible, and let the trains keep running for goodness sake.

When a train pulls up to the platform, and the doors open -let the people that want to exit the train off board first!

They continue to raise ticket prices while lowering service.  Crazy stinky homeless people are allowed to sleep on the cars.  BART does nothing about it, but why should they?  They know we'll choose them over MUNI.BART's dirty little secret (told to me by my friend who works there): female station agents tend to get raped if they are shutting down the station at night.  BART does nothing about this.  Nice."
406,3,"Nov 14, 2012","In many ways this San Francisco people mover resembles the L.A. Metro or even the London Underground, except for the fact that riding BART costs more than either of them (especially when you pick up a $5 Metro day pass or utilize a London Oyster card/travelcard, etc). I'm completely lost on why, when traveling in a group, friends will insist on taking the BART into the city, even with a car available. From Millbrae to, say, Embarcadero and back is almost $10. If there are 4 of you, that's $40 to go 16 miles and return. I suppose the one major benefit is not worrying about parking. On the plus side, BART trains are more frequent in coming, they have arrival time estimates posted, and they take you to more distant places than MUNI does. With their ticketing system, you don't have to fumble with getting your card out to show hounding conductors or negotiate with drivers over whether or not you were within the time limit on your transfer. In short, convenient (sometimes), but not cheap."

The directions for loading the maps/schedules onto iPods are completely unclear (at least for me on my Mac).  The trip planner is not intuitive.

I walked 5 blocks out of my way tonight because I don't go into the city often and I'm new to town.  5 blocks.  5.

I swear that some of the trains have not been refurbished or reupholstered since BART started running in the early 70's.  Hence the grease stains on the backs of the seats.  (Why anyone would rest their head on the backs of those seats, I will never know.) I used to take BART into the City when I was in high school to escape suburbia.  Now I still take it to escape suburbia, but I take it to go to work.  I would choose BART over driving to work any day.  I live about a mile from the Concord station so I get a nice walk to & from BART every day.  Sometimes I don't drive for weeks at a time.

It was your fault too. I know that sometimes your trains catch on fire and what not--they work very hard and all. But I was very troubled when I sleepily opened my eyes on the Richmond--Fremont train and found that I was still in San Leandro though I should be 5 minutes away from Fremont by now. Then I became even more flustered when I looked at the electric sign and saw that I was now on a Richmond train, rather than a Fremont train.I promptly ran out and gave my friends a call, because I would surely be late for our trip to Monterey. Then I found a Fremont train in relief...until you evacuated us at the next stop, forcing us to wait 15 minutes for the next Fremont train while this one turned into a Richmond train, like the last, going the opposite way. Why did you do this? I am just lucky that I realized the train-transformation before I found myself back in Berkeley again. Thank you for lengthening my commute from 50 minutes to an hour and a half.

Moreover, the station lighting is extremely dim - I was riding early morning and literally could not see anything due to the filthy glass and the third world type station lighting.Second - every time I take BART, I cannot believe how expensive the ride is.  How come in Seattle you pay $2.50 for the same or greater distance?  How come BART does not sell discount tickets at the vending machines?

I'm glad I've learned to listen to it.Turns out BART is the Bay Area Rapid Transit system. Walking upto the platform, I read the instructions on how to buy my ticket. Back in Calgary, we have a flat fair to ride. It'll cost you $2.75 CDN to go from one end of the city to the other. Here in SF, it's a different price for each stop. The fares were listed on a printout taped up inside of a page protector next to the electronic ticket booths. My one way ride was $8.10. I'm not going to complain about the price of the C-Train in Calgary anymore.Buying my ticket was a bit of an unusual experience as well. After reading the instructions on requiring a different fair depending on the stop I was headed to, I figured I'd be able to pick my stop, stick my money in, grab my ticket and be on my way. It was almost that simple, but not quite. Instead, after looking up the cost of the fair on the print out, I then had to stick my money in the ticketing machine and change the fair to the appropriate amount using buttons that added or subtracted $1 or $0.05 at a time. It was a little strange. What happens if you don't put in enough money for the stop you're going to? I'm not sure, and I decided I didn't want to find out.Next step, getting on the train. Calgary trains have a button to press to make the doors open. BART trains... don't. So how do you make the silly things open? I tried everything. I touched the door, I jumped on the black space on the platform that the train car doors lined up with (in case it was some new fandangled space age San Fran train that was weight triggered or something). I even waved my arms up and down in front of the door on the off chance that a motion sensor would open the doors. Nothing. Those doors didn't budge. A gentleman behind me tried pushing on the doors. Nothing for him either. The train sat there for another couple of moments. I gave up and resigned myself to the fact that perhaps I had missed my chance to get on this one (I had bought my ticket after it pulled up after all). Thirty seconds later, the doors opened on their own. After I got on the train and got myself settled, I opened up the map I had grabbed before buying my ticket. Looking at it now, I figured out where I'd need to get off the train to switch over to another train to get to the right stop for my hotel. See, the train I got on was part of the yellow line. The map showed three other lines, and the stop I wanted resided on the red line. I looked closely at my map and saw four white dots all in a row on each line at Balboa. This must be where all four tracks coincide. I would get off there and switch over to the red track.As we pulled into the Daly City station, the operator made an announcement that anyone wishing to switch trains should do so at this station! What?? But it didn't have any white dots on the map! Maybe that didn't matter? I thought it wiser to listen to him and got off the train. I headed for the exit to go find the platform for the red track. I ended up on the platform on the other side, trains on this side were headed back in the direction I came from. Confused, I retraced my steps down the stairs and happened upon the information desk. ""Excuse me, what train will take me to Powell Station?"" I asked the desk attendant. ""Anyone on that side"" she replied as she pointed to the platform I had been on in the first place. Turns out I had pictured a much bigger and more intricate train system than what existed. Sure there are four lines, but there are only two sets of rails. Go figure.BART, your doors and your map tricked me. But your attendant was helpful, and you provided me with my first experience of San Francisco. Not all cities have the benefit of a train that can take you all the way to the airport for under $10, nor does the acronym for their transit system flow so nicely into a one syllable name. We had our ups and downs on that first ride, but overall, you're not so bad."
418,3,"Sep 2, 2011","I will have to agree with many of the reviews... I personally commute to San Francisco and can vouch for these topics of interest... The negatives... 1. Cleanliness should be increased. No one likes the smell of urine. 2. More trains should run from 7-9am and 4:30-6:30pm... 15 minutes is too long to wait for a train... 3. talk about robbery... $$$ Its far too expensive to be crammed on a train car like cattle for 35 minutes... An the sad part is BART talks about raises prices... 4. Weekends should have trains running past midnight, it would promote less drunk driving and bring more people into the City... The positives... 1. You can avoid traffic and the extra time it would consume in your day... 2. You don't have to pay the high prices of city parking ;) 3. more environmentally friendly 4. If you are a people watcher, there is quite a show! (wear sunglasses) A few other side notes... some BART locations are now charging $1 for parking, which is unfortunate... And some locations are definitely safer than others... so be aware of your surroundings. (or where you are parking your car)"

Una amiga de Mexico estaba aqui and ella quiere ir a museo en Oakland.Yes, one of my most admired friends came up specifically to visit me and wanted to check out an exhibit at the Oakland Museum. It was the last weekend that the exhibit would be on display so we made plans on Sunday to take a trip out. She had booked a room in the City and I had planned to drive there, but she being the ""eco-friendly"" friend wanted to take public transportation. I admit, I am not the best at knowing the how's and what's of our local public transportation systems. But I do know we have something called BART.The Embarcadero station was a few steps away from her hotel and the pay stations were easy to figure out. My friend was a but upset that they didnt give you change in pesos, but I explained to her that our currency has been battered by the global economy and any exposure that we get these days is much needed.That BART tube is kind of trippy and made a wooooshing sound which I thought was cool. Worthy of 2 stars alone.Easy, not very clean but clean enough for me and convenient."
420,1,"Dec 8, 2012","Now I shall complain about parking. I haven't taken Bart in awhile but the other day I had to go into the city for an interview. I left an hour early and decided Daly City Bart was the best form of transportation to the Financial District on a Thursday afternoon. WRONG.I circled EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEIR PARKING LOTS...TWICE. What did I find? No empty parking lots that's for sure. I did, however, find two to three floors of ""reserved"" spots which happened to be all EMPTY. Who are these spots reserved for?? Because no one sure as hell parks in them.Long story short, I ended up driving to the city and made it to my interview on time. Yay me."
421,2,"Nov 25, 2011","I just wanted to add that some of the Bart employees are not very friendly. Exhibit A: The convo. I had earlier with one of the Bart attendants. I had $2.50 left on a previous Bart ticket from awhile back that was stamped, ""See Bart Attendant."" Okay, so I walked up to one of the attendants in the glass box.Bart attendant: ""Yes?""Me: ""Hi =] I wanted to use up this ticket, but it says see attendant first.""Bart attendant: *sigh* [grabs ticket, doodles on it]Me: ""I understand it's not enough fair so should I add onto it now?""Bart attendant: ""You add to it when you get to your destination!!!"" *looking at me like, DUH!* ""Here's your ticket go through.""Me: ""Oh okay thanks.""So I try going through, but it spit the ticket back out. So I walk back over to the lady.Me: ""Hi again, it didn't work.""Bart attendant: *Rolls eyes and grabs ticket in frustration* ""Try it again......""Me: *Fake smile on my face* ""............Ok.""It worked this time around but geez. I felt like I was making her night horrible since she was sitting in one spot and had to roll her chair over to another to press a button for me. Some peoples lives are just so hard."
422,2,"Nov 23, 2011","Yes Bart is fast, easy, convenient, and cheap.It also is dirty and ranks of homeless peoples urine.I use to take Bart all the time for work and I was so tired of constantly feeling as if I needed to use my antibacterial hand lotion. Which I did. I don't care for the people who take Bart. I've witnessed a lot of people with attitudes who think their shit doesn't stink pick on older couples and the elderly. They're lucky I didn't go Chuck Norris on their asses."
423,2,"Apr 12, 2017","Drives me crazy to see Bart police hanging out with station agents in the morning and then I have to get on a train half filled with homeless people taking up seats from paying customers. I board at the Pittsburg station and trains go off line for about 10mins before turning around. During that turn around time it's wouldn't take much to walk the train and kick them off. I've been told by Bart, it's a ""regional problem"", just seem nothing is being done and it's frustrating."
426,3,"Nov 14, 2006","Bart is my most-oft-used magical transport to downtown SF, because I'm only 4 blocks away from it, it's speedy, and it's more reliable than MUNI.I also love that I can take it to SFO and OAK when I need to fly fly away.Also, you don't need to carry cash on you all the time (Exact-F'ing-Change MUNI bastards say what?), which is awesome.But...Some total dumb-ass decided that trains should stop running around 12:30am.  This is the most idiotic, poorly conceived, anti-public-safety shit ever.  12:30 is early enough that pretty much noone is going to plan to take bart home after going out drinking, which means anyone who isn't local to where they're drinking is going to drive home.  Drunk.This is idiotic.If they only pushed the schedule back so that the last trains left SF at, say, 2am, I'm willing to bet there'd be a significant reduction in the number of drunk drivers.  How hard could this really be?It's also really loud, especially in the tunnels.  I'd be curious to know if daily bart riders experience hearing degredation over time because of it.  (sidenote: noise cancelling headphones are awesome)"
427,2,"Feb 7, 2010","Yesterday morning, on my way to work, I randomly spoke to a New Yorker on the BART who'd just landed at SFO and was trying to figure out what stop we were at, and I suddenly remembered my initial bewilderment when I first started using it; I had a lot of trouble trying to figure out where I was.The fact that the stations are quite dark, which makes it difficult to see the signs informing you where you are from inside the trains is bad enough, but add to that the apparent refusal of the drivers to tell you what station you're at whenever the train stops, and it explains completely her, and my, total (initial) confusion.On top of this, who thought it was a good idea to have *carpets* on public transport? The filthy stains at the back of each carriage lend themselves to the explanation of their own existence. The off-white interior just *feels* dirty, and the architecture of the entire system seems like a horribly, unmodern throwback to the 70s.The frequent delays, the horrendous schedule (seriously, do I really have to wait 15 minutes at a little past 6pm?) combined with the general dark and dank feel, it's hardly the experience you'd want from a post-2000 transport system.It gets you where you need to go (providing that you want to get to somewhere along that one line straight through the city), but you certainly won't enjoy the ride."
428,4,"Jun 14, 2007","I don't know why people complain. Without it, you won't get anywhere. You will need a car, need to pay car insurance, car payment, and gas which is cost more than a gallon milk now. What's the problem? I took it today almost all day, it saved me gas, time, parking, and irritation when I drive in heavy traffic. Things to enjoy, sit there, read a book, magazine, listen to music, chat with friends and relax. Nothing to worry about except getting on the right Bart or leaving at the right stop.  You don't get this spoiled in every city, so don't badger it.Where can you go for $3.75? Answer: SF to Downtown Berkeley."

Then I hate you because you end your service at the dumb-dumb time of twelve or so, cause me to stay stuck in the East Bay and never romp till late night in the city unless i or another friend drives.Then I love your cushy seats and and all the fantabulous people watching- because, well, everyone rides BART.But I hate you, because everyone rides BART and during high traffic times I'm smashed into one of your cars like a freaky clown sardine.Sunny days = loves (sunny, relaxing, half naked hot people)rainy day = hate (smells, wet, cranky people)late night service = loves (awesome for holidays!)late night service = hate (never happens- except for once or twice a year...every plastered person in the Bay Area crammed on BART)What am i going to do with you BART?"
430,5,"Jun 19, 2008","Maybe I'm not the best person to gauge public transit because I grew up in LA and don't remember my 2.5 years in NYC, but consider this:1) It usually shows up on time2) $5.35 one-way to SFO from SF vs. ~$40 via cab3) Stations are relatively clean compared to most places4) Trains are comfortable 5) The ookiness I feel knowing when I'm hundreds of feet below the bay in the Transbay TubeGranted, it stops a little too early and maybe compared to NYC it doesn't compare in terms of convenience, but compared to most places SF has it good in terms of public transportation.

432,3,"Oct 2, 2007","I ride BART every day.  And this is what I can say: they do an entirely okay job.  They could use more trains during peak hours.  They could stay open all night long (all niiiiiiiight, all night long).  The trains could be cleaner.  The stations could be cleaner.  BART employees could act as though they gave a shit about anything.  BART could let people with bikes on before 6 pm (they let people with strollers and screaming crotch fruit on at all hours, and they take up at least as much room).  And BART could sure as hell make sure that the escalators always run UP.  No one needs a DOWN escalator, BART.Prices are quite reasonable, at least for people who can use the FastPass."

Now if only they would have expanded into San Jose like they intended to..."
435,3,"Oct 10, 2015","Any public transportation in a complex city is a good thing.  The BART has been around for years and expanded.  Because it has SF airport and Oakland airport on its line, it really makes it idea for travelers to take.  Parking is difficult and expensive in SF.  So the BART option is really a good one.  I understand the frustration with price and time with the system. Having used the Washington D.C. metro system (which copied BART), I see the need of such system.  Perhaps if I lived here, I wouldn't like the price.  But as a visitor, it is the best way to go.  Don't be influence by the bad reviews.  It is safe and convinient."
438,2,"Mar 8, 2009","Really a 2.5er, but I got to drop a star for their recent renovation. When are cloth seats acceptable for mass transit? They're not. They recently renovated many of their trains and had the brains to rip out the nasty-ass carpet, so why keep the cloth seats? Of course the trains still stink. Take a lesson form the NYC MTA, London's Tube and  Paris' Metro: these people-movers have one thing in common: plastic bench seating. Why would a brash upstart like BART try to reinvent the light rail? And then to charge what they charge is pretty weak. Why does it stop running at midnight on weekends? Are they in cahoots with the Taxi association or do they think that it's a good thing for people to drive across the bridge buzzed? One train per hour from Civic Center to 12th Street would maybe save a few live every year. That's a good thing. I'm going to try AC Transit for a few weeks and see how it compares to my old stand by, BART."
439,3,"Mar 18, 2008","Yay to BART for getting me to OAK airport and downtown SF without having to fight for parking. And I like that my local BART station does NOT charge parking. My condolences to those of you who do have to pay. Boo to the fact that it can be pretty pricey, crowded during peak hours, and the dirty, smelly cars. Plus some riders look sketchy. I had an experience where this guy took a seat directly behind me. And maybe he had Tourette's or something but I highly doubt that - out of nowhere he screamed at the top of his lungs: ""&%# YOU! I MEAN IT!"" Everyone on the car just looked up. He got off at the same stop as me. Yikes! That's public transportation for you."
440,4,"Apr 17, 2007","I'm a fan of Bart.  As an exMuni-train commuter I've come to appreciate BART - it's regularity, it's orderly lines and soft seats.  So much so that my car sits lonely and dusty on the street.  Happiness to me is letting BART deal with driving, while I read a book.  That being said, to get BART up to 5 stars, here are 5 rules fellow riders need to stick to:1. Walk left, stand right!   If you want to treat the escalator as a ride or are too lazy to walk (I am guilty of this), stand to your right.  Don't block those people running for their trains to get to work on time.2. Have your ticket out as you approach the 'turn-styles.'  You had to put the ticket into the slot to get into BART, what did you think was going to happen when you got off the train?  Don't clog up a gate while you fumble for your ticket either.  You risk getting crushed to death by the ever forward moving throng.  That or just really irritating the person stuck behind yee of the short sight.  3.  Don't have loud cell phone conversations for all to hear, and for the love of god can you get a less obnoxious ring-tone!  I don't need to hear the intimate details of your life, nor do the people in the next train.  I'm sorry you have that outbreak but I hear they have a cream for it.  Now get off the phone, don't touch me, and look-up a 24 hour pharmacy on Yelp!4.  If someone is reading a book, they don't want to talk to you.  Unless it is a trashy romance novel.  They might be lonely.5.  Don't hold the doors open.  BART is sensitive, it likes to breakdown.  If you hold the door open and knock my train out of service I'm going to give you...well a really evil eye at the least (OK the most)  Although, watching people getting crushed in the doors is a personal favorite BART pastime of mine.  Cruel but hilarious."

Some stinky, dirty cars, with an occasional mental wandering/in the car, cars with heaters on hot days, and air conditioners on cold days.

The best thing I could say, is that it is mostly on time.But now, the entitled BART workers are on strike, devastating the daily schedules of hundreds of thousands of people, and costing local businesses millions of dollars. It's as if there had been a terrorist attack shutting down the region's transport, I'm not equating BART workers to being terrorist. No, I'm equating the damage they are causing.Why are they allowed to strike? Why aren't they all fired for wasting the public's time and causing this much financial damage?They're seeking raises? Not willing to pay more for their benefits (like people do in jobs now)?Instead they are holding the public hostage.

More than a million dollars has been allotted to add more officers and cleaners. This is great to hear. They also showed 2 BART police officers trying to clear a hallway. It appears this was not at the same time as the citizen's video. I had to laugh. I have never seen a police presence at BART where the trains are and now this. A huge thanks to this one citizen who had it. We all need to do this. This is a huge public safety issue. Even just 1 cop where the trains load or unload at the notorious stations only would help.

444,4,"Jun 10, 2011","If you get a chance, not that you will, but take a look at the reviews for Philadelphia's SEPTA (which ironically sounds like septic and, well, that reminds me of shit) and then take a look back at the BART reviews. There's a huge disconnect in city transportation developers between Philadelphia and San Francisco, but major kudos to the Bay Area for getting it right.The cost to ride is a little on the steep side, but we used it fairly infrequently on our visit. Given that we mostly walked to and from the hotel to all of our touristy destinations, we took the bus more often than rail, but it served us just fine. Schedules were easy to read, the ride was smooth and clean, and figuring out how to get from point A to point B was a virtual no-brainer. For being public transportation it far exceeded any expectations I have ever had for big city travel."
445,3,"Aug 9, 2008","BART is showing it's age - but hey, it can't be beat in getting into SF, avoiding parking hassles and paying outrageous parking fees.It gets really crowded during rush hour, the ventilation doesn't always work, and there are delays. The noise while riding in the cars can get deafening at times. Finding parking in the parking structures can sometimes be hard (especially in the Daly City or Fremont BART stations).Thank goodness I don't have to rely on BART for my commute - but in these days high gas prices, I won't hesitate in taking BART to SF."
446,2,"Apr 27, 2011","I take Bart on a daily basis and its never a pleasant experience. Its devastating, but I've chose to deal with it. During the several months that I have taken bart, I have seen, heard, and smelled weird things. Today for instance, some person almost sat on me. I have also seen fights, people picking their nose, as well as the homeless panhandling for a cheese burger. Yea, you'll definitely find yourself exposed to awkward, uncomfortable, and strange situations on Bart - without a doubt! The trains are filthy, musty, and germ infested. It's really gross and I'm hoping I don't die from some foreign disease cultivated in those trains. The seats are stained with God knows what, the floors are sticky, and there's always trash tucked along the sides of the seat. They obviously do not spend enough money maintaining the trains or enforcing their ""no food or drink"" rule. Their sliding doors do not stay open for anyone, so beware because I've seen the doors shut on people as they try to slide through, it doesn't open back up like elevator doors, it just squeezes you until you get out of the way. Every aspect of Bart is yucky, but I've learned to accept it, which is why I wear the same ugly jackets all the time, which gets washed every Friday. Bart really deters me from buying new clothes; I mean what's the point? It will just get ruined. Everyday, twice a day, I sit in an awkward position making sure that I don't touch any foreign objects and that my hair doesn't touch the seats. I then go home and take a shower within minutes!! I'm really not a germaphobe but, bart conditions are far from acceptable. Others will probably argue against me, as I have seen people sleep comfortably on the seats, in the fetal position, occupying two seats at once while an elder has to stand!!!!!!!!!"
447,2,"Oct 13, 2015","Sure...it gets you from Point A to Point B and serves people without other transportation options. But its a bad experience that absolutely pales in comparison to mass transit system in major cities around the world.  BART is a poorly planned linear system that leaves populated areas of the Bay Area poorly served.  There aren't enough cars to provide service even as it is due to BART's poorly managed financial condition and the cars on the track are generally very overcrowded.  The trains itself sound like they are about to fall apart as they rattle down the ancient tracks and the interiors are filthy and appear to go uncleaned for months.  Windows, seats, floors are all dirty and stained.    The stations are for the most part are dirty, depressing concrete monoliths that reflect the institutional, unimaginative utilitarian architecture of the late 1960s and early 1970s.  Many stations and parking lots are dangerous after dark.  Worst of all, BART management seeks to stick taxpayers with new taxes to operate the system in 2016.  Meanwhile, BART will not seek to tax corporations and real estate owners whose property values skyrocketed when BART stations were constructed near their property.  Such assessments are perfectly legal to do under California law and many mass transit systems around the globe provide funding this way.  This funding failure has been studied by planning and transportation professors at UC Berkeley and reported in this article....http://www.eastbayexpress.com/oakland/barts-big-gift-to-wealthy-corporations/Content?oid=3654041BART/mass transit is a public good.

451,2,"Jun 3, 2019","Some of the rudest train oprators in the country work here.They can be unabashedly nasty over the PA.  BART does not enforce their own rules--such as related to bringing bikes on crowded trains, the car interiors are dirty and not well maintained.l, and rain can cause system-wide delays."
452,3,"Oct 14, 2012","Where can they improve?For starters they can have more BART police on the trains (despite their bad rap) it would certainly minimize the amount of homeless people who get on the trains, take up and entire seat because they need a nap, stink up the cars,  take a shit on the seats, and have entire LOUD arguments with people only they can see, disrupting everyone's ride.Maybe having an entire car reserved only for people with bikes, so they are not taking up space on the trains with their bikes while the train is crowded. Guess what BART? Restricting them to certain times of day is not helping. DEDICATE A WHOLE CAR TO THEM, THEY'RE GETTING ON MY NERVES WITH ALL THE SPACE THEY TAKE UP.Us BART riders can complain and complain until our faces turn colors, however, the simple fact is that we need it, AND we will keep riding it. I don't think BART really cares if you have a good experience or not, as long as a) your not suing them and b) you keep giving them your money. PLAIN AND SIMPLE."
453,3,"Apr 11, 2013","Sure the BART is old, dirty, and sometimes stinky, but it's is a pretty convenient, cheap, and fast way to travel around the Bay Area. I usually take the BART from the SFO airport into downtown San Francisco which takes about 40 minutes which currently costs $8.25. It is definitely a much cheaper alternative to renting a car and paying sky high parking fees."
454,5,"Jan 17, 2008","I heart you BART...I have never owned a car, and you continue to reinforce that decision.  I can visit my Gramma in Lafayette (I could visit my other Grandma in Pleasanton, but she never invites me over...) my sister in Pleasant Hill, my friends in Berkeley, get to City College to go to class...and visit Lake Merritt to take a famed gondola ride...Its a great place to people watch, read, snooze (although, I always feel a little sketched by sleeping on public transit...it usually is an accident if it happens), play sudoku, gather my thoughts, etc, etc...I wish you would replace Cal-Train, and also go to the North Bay though...that would be AWESOME!*I've always wondered why the isles are carpeted..."
455,2,"Aug 30, 2008","I wanted to write this review to profess my undying hatred for BART. Most days.Some days, BART is great and takes you to where you want to be, without a problem. Many days, bart is horrible and cannot take you to where you want to be as quick as you want to get there, for a myriad of stupid reasons. These usually include: 1. ""We are experiencing problems with the train/track and will have to wait an eternity on the track until some idiot figures out what happened.""2. ""The train in front of us has a locked axle and we have to wait until some idiot figures out what happened and unlocks the axle. Hopefully he won't touch the electric third rail and electrocute himself in the process, but if he does, we'll have to wait an additional 30 minutes.""3. ""The train conductor wants to grab a sandwich at the nearby shop at the next station, so until he has some hot pastrami in his hands, we will not be leaving the station.""4. Green fairies are flying around in the front of the train, and we don't want to hit them and stop the magic in this world, so we will be sitting on the tracks for another 10 minutes.5. We need to re-route the train because some hippie event is going on, and we don't want to hit the hippies.Bay area rapid transit? I've always thought it should be something more like Bay area Retarded transit. Or Bay area Ridiculous transit. Bart is incredibly unreliable, so don't count on getting anywhere on time if you take it. Don't get me wrong, many days, you'll get to exactly where you want to be, when you want to get there, and bart is a glorious experience. But on those days where the fairies are partying in the middle of the tracks, well, you'll just have to go with the attitude, ""I'll get there when I get there."" And, ""the fairies are just as important as I am."""
456,4,"Nov 16, 2010","I really appreciate the ease and convenience of BART.  As somebody who doesn't live in the city but visits frequently, I always have a really easy time getting around.  I can get right to downtown from SFO in roughly a half hour, and I can get from downtown to Berkeley for a football game in roughly the same amount of time.  For tourists like myself, BART just makes getting in and out of the city so easy.  My only minor complaints or issues:  Cloth seats, just gross, unless you get a newish car, this can;t be a good idea on rainy days when the seats stay wet all day.  Why are there only 4-5 stops in downtown?  I know the line wraps through the city but there are so many neighborhoods with no subway access and nothing near Golden Gate Park.  These issues are hardly enough to outweigh the amazing positives of BART."
457,2,"Jun 16, 2012","BART is... weird. It was originally conceived as a ""train of the future,"" and it does have that sort of futuristic glean to it, with the huge oddly-shaped broad-guage railcars and the strange whirring and grinding noises it makes. It's also very zippy for a US subway system.Then there are these surprising moments of un-modernness, like the lack of automated announcements or LED signs onboard. These trains of the future still have conductors making barely comprehensible announcements. (D.C.'s Metro, which is probably the most similar system to BART, suffers this perplexing anachronism as well.) And man, BART has by far the grossest, filthiest railcar interiors I've ever seen. Those seats! My god, those seats. And the carpeting too (also: carpeting on public transit... really??), which is probably releasing mutant mold spores with every step. It looks like it hasn't been cleaned in at least decade, and the cars smell like--and I'm trying to be kind here--a golden retriever that has just emerged from a swamp. All you want to do is bathe in bleach after you've sat down on one of those things. Nasty, nasty. Odd though, because the stations are actually pretty nice and well-maintained. Not as nice: those farecard vending machines, which actually manage to be more confusing than even Chicago's. Isn't SF supposed to be the technology city? Aren't there any user interface designers that can help out? The thing is, BART wouldn't be too hard to make actually really nice. New seats, new vending machines, and some better signage. Oh, and cheaper tickets (yeah, right.)"
458,1,"May 26, 2019",The WORST train system in the country! PERIOD! The trains are overrun with homeless. Their train schedule is a true joke. Always changing ane trains are constantly LATE! Sadly they are the only thing we have. The whole system top to bottom is getting worse and they are and will continue to lose patrons. We get less for our dollars from BART every year. The whole BART board should be fired. The whole system is a bad joke. And no ones laughing...
459,3,"Sep 14, 2009","Being a Boston girl, I appreciate public transportation and using the BART in SF is no different for me. It's clean, fast, and on time, what more can I ask for? It lost a star because I'm not fond of their vending machines to get my tickets. It was rather confusing and it didn't tell me how much it cost to get to a certain location. THEN it costs a lot! what's that all about?"
460,3,"Feb 25, 2015","I don't know why people complain so much about BART! It helps people travel where they need to go pretty much anywhere in the Bay (looking forward to the San Jose extension) at a relatively low cost. I take BART into the city from the East Bay all the time and it's great because I don't have to worry about driving or parking. Sure it can be a little grimey and sketchy at times, but it gets ya where you need to go."
463,5,"Nov 4, 2009","You know, a lot of times, I feel like public transportation gets the shit end of the stick. All the faults are constantly pointed out and all the good qualities are over-looked.I am from Chicago, where we have a heavily train-based public transportation system. It's good, but it still has it's issues.Now...I was very, very impressed with the BART. You basically get to sit in fucking Lazy Boy chairs, you have notices in the station of when the next train is coming, there's very few  delays and everything is well marked.It's a little pricey to get around (it's a pay system that you pay more the farther you go, instead of a flat rate, like Chicago), but man, it's a nice system."
464,4,"Sep 10, 2007","Dear BART,I love you and I miss you. Please come to Austin.Sincerely,MeredithPS - Could you bring the price down a tad and stop making me wait so long when I miss the train?PPS - The crazy people who semi-assault me (and others) in the stations are a bit of a concern."
465,3,"Jul 5, 2009","BART is great. I'm on it everyday on my commute to work. Fast and efficient -- more or less on time (unlike its evil brother, MUNI). The electronic passes were an improvement, but why isn't there anything more similar to a fastpass? (I guess MUNI does do somethings right...) Also what the hell is this about shutting down at midnight. THIS IS A WORLD CLASS CITY FOR CHRIST SAKE. This is why people get DUIs! *cough*"
466,3,"Dec 10, 2009","I thought I was supposed to relax when taking public transportation. Such worries like parking, driving, and gas dissolve away when using BART, however, these worries are replaced by many others. Public transportation these days feels like a gamble. There have been a good number of well publicized incidents including bus crashes, police using excessive force, and the recent Muni stabbing along with the BART train derailing. Additionally BART fees have been hiked up and parking enforced until 4PM. With current headlines terrorizing my consciousness and additional fees leeching my wallet, I still apprehensively take BART as a good alternative to the four wheeler.BART wish list:-Replacing all the fabric seats and flooring with the NYC subway type design. All those stains do not add a vintage charm.-I heard they were testing free wifi on BART? Is this ready to go yet?-Do something about the San Francisco tunnel noise. It's friggin' loud!-The new BART website is a visual improvement but it's still not perfect.-More localized places to offer BART tickets?-More security onboard trains especially during the holidays."
467,3,"Feb 13, 2009","BART,Please contact Billy Mays for a large purchase of Oxy Clean, immediately.  Some of your seats are repulsive and a mystery stain follow me home.Please, I beg of you, call Billy."
468,1,"Jun 9, 2009","OK, so BART gets me from A to B. If there wasn't BART we would be stuck paying toll and in hours of traffic trying to cross into San Francisco. However, can BART get its act together and clean up a bit??? I have seen bugs, smelled piss, body odor, and bad breath among other things. When I first started commuting into San Francisco I kept getting sick. When I narrowed it down BART was the culprit. Tip: Bring hand sanitizer with you when you ride BART so that you can at least sanitize your hands after a ride.  At least wash your hands directly after a trip to stop the spread of germs. I believe that BART should not have carpet or cloth seats. Cloth seats and carpet are ludicrous. They are absolutely filthy, gunky and germ infested. I think linoleum floor and plastic seats would be a good idea so that they can be hosed down on a daily basis. Oh and people do NOT follow the no-eating rules -food bits and stains all over the place. In general there are a few dirt-bag BART riders that ruin it for us all. Additionally, many people blare their stupid music super loud or talk on their cell phones with the volume up so damn loud that you can hear the other person on the line. BART can you please regulate the people going from train to train asking for money? Rude BART riders can you please let old men and women and pregnant ladies have a damn seat? GOSH! I have to ride BART to get to and from work. If there was another convenient option I would absolutely take it!"

470,1,"Feb 18, 2011","You can say that it is better than NYC, but it still sucks. Too few trains, too few cars, and too many idiots running the show. I had a 2 hr delay because of ""equipment trouble"". And after service resumed, they ran four trains in a row going to the same destination (the 2-4th trains were empty of course) while everyone waiting to go anywhere else had to wait for over 30min more to have one of their trains arrive. I guess that once service resumed, the operators were so relieved that they stopped doing their jobs. They should be fired and so should their managers for having their heads up their asses.Can I get a 'no' vote on their next budget request that just will line the pockets of these incompetent public servants and their union lawyers?You suck BART!!!"
471,4,"Apr 14, 2011","I love BART.It's ALWAYS on time (unlike caltrain)... and it's reasonably cheap. It's very easy to understand how the schedule and routes work... You can take Bart around the city all the way down to Milbrae, where Caltrain takes it from there if you continue heading south, and it also can bring you to SFO, Richmond, Berkeley, Concord, Oakland, Fremont, and so forth. Beats traffic anytime!In reality, BART is pretty gross. It's quite efficient with getting you to Point A to B or even to C, but there are stains on the seats from god knows what... I don't get why they even bothered putting in FABRIC seating in a mass public transit that I'm sure millions of people use? Not very thoughtful if you ask me. I don't get why they can't just replace it soon because it needs it (or at least plastic coverings?). Other than the nasty facts, its pretty comfortable if you don't think of it too much. Just go home and take a nice hot shower and scrub your booty clean because you know those seats are NASTY.Safety? I've never had trouble on BART.. Seems safe!. I could say something ABOUT MUNI'S SAFETY... But this is my review for BART and BART only. =PI tend to fall asleep in BART because of the ""oOooOooHHhoOOOHHHHHHWoooooooooooOoooo"" sounds it makes when running. Hahaha, yes it's strange how it comforts me after a long day of work. Does anyone else get sleepy from this too? Is it just me?"
472,1,"May 13, 2019","I took Bart yesterday from Dublin to Powell and back. We had to transfer at 12th st due to maintenance.  Th 12th  Street station was filthy with urine. There was an an angry ranting person on the platform  at Powell. There was another angry ranting person on the platform at twelfth coming back. There were seriously shady characters on the train. I would never let my 20 year old beautiful daughter take that train alone on a weekend late afternoon. She would be in serious danger. I will avoid the weekends myself whenever I can. I used to love Bart, but not anymore."
475,4,"Jul 9, 2009","BART is like a secret lover.  It shows up on time, moves quickly and doesn't hesitate to leave when the business is done.  Sure it's dirty, loud and has been ridden a few times before, but that just adds to the excitement, doesn't it?An hour and a half of my workday is spent in the tunnels and elevated tracks of the BART system.  Without it, I am stuck on the roads, a slave to the pace and gridlock of the Bay freeways.  With it, I know exactly what time I will be where, and that gives me peace of mind.  I can read the paper, play Rolando, scribble Yelp reviews, sleep.  There are so many options.Pay no attention to the detractors, they are not BART locals, they are BART tourists.  This system is reliable, competitively priced and unequaled in California.  It is the only thing that allows me to live in San Francisco while maintaining a job in an East Bay suburban nightmare they call a city.  And anything that allows me to live in San Francisco is deserving of unlimited praise."
476,3,"Jun 19, 2014","BART, clean up your act!  Trim your upper management and hire cleaners who actually clean.  Enforce the animal, food/drink, and fare-evasion rules.  Too many animals on BART.  The two- and four-legged varieties.  No, that dog is NOT a service animal.  It's a pet.  And you can't bring those on BART.A pit bull took a dump on the escalator the other day at one of the downtown stations.  The owner acted as if nothing was happening and made no attempt to clean it up.Trash is constantly being thrown on platforms and on cars.  People dig into their KFC and throw the bones on the floor.  They wolf down a burrito and wipe their hands on the seats.  The leave their half-finished big gulp on the floor where eventually it falls over and soaks into the carpet.  A general layer of scum has accumulated on every surface.  The stations and cars need about triple the attention they're getting today."
477,4,"Apr 20, 2011","BART does a great job of getting people to and from their destinations, very nearly flawlessly.  And the price can't be beat, especially with gas headed toward $5 a gallon.One star deduction for the general unkempt condition of the cars.  I can still remember when BART had pristine carpeting and fresh seat covers in every car.  But back in those days, they enforced the ""no food or drink on BART"" rule.  Most of the mess on BART is due to customers throwing or dropping things on the floors and seats.  So a combination of better rule enforcement and better cleaning is in order.  For all the people who knock off stars because public transit was late, consider that all forms of transportation (including driving) are subject to delays.  If you get in a car and head off toward a bridge, you may very well encounter slowdowns or unforeseen traffic jams.  People jump in front of BART trains (they euphemistically call those ""Medical Emergencies"").  Think about it."
478,2,"Feb 7, 2009","The cars are too often dirty and stinky.  Every single train should have one cop on it.  Too often people on these trains are sketchy as hell.  The trains are often very loud and make weird noises.  Why can't we learn from Japan.  BART has spread out more over the years, which is nice.  But prices are high and they don't run late enough.  If they could just run the trains until 3am then all the people coming from the bars could ride the trains.  The stations are usually dirty and many of them don't have bathrooms.  I think BART should be open 24 hours a day and the trains improved.  This time let's do it right,  And take a power washer and wash out those stations for chrissakes."
479,3,"Jul 6, 2007",It's better than nothing.Thank you BART for letting me carve my name on your windows for all of those years with a drill bit.  Uh...just kidding?  lol
480,2,"Jul 14, 2013",BART is a necessary evil. It is the best way to get around to many locations but totally sucks. The trains are just filthy and all smell.

482,3,"Mar 4, 2015","I took Bart to avoid traffic going to warriors game from San Jose. Normally I don't use public transportation. It was nice not to have to drive, and I got on without wait the first time, but on the way back we timed it wrong and waited fifteen minutes to get on. There was a loud, screeching noise that echoed through the cars for almost the whole ride,, which made it very unpleasant. I haven't quite decided if the positives outweigh the negatives yet."
483,4,"Jan 20, 2010","BART has its drawbacks. Let's not kid ourselves:- outdated interiors- intense rail noise (especially in the trans-bay tube)- sometimes malodorous cars and/or unknown liquids spilled on the seats- an assortment of drunk, homeless, or mentally ill riders.- people who shriek on cell phones or play what passes as ""music"" from cell phone speakers at max volume.But that said, there are good points too.- It's way cheaper than driving (especially over long distances), and this savings is even greater if you buy your tix with commuter checks.- Though it's subject to delays and problems, the longest I've ever been held up is 20 minutes. Average delay is about 5 minutes. People who drive along 880 during commute hours only wish they had such minimal delays.- If you're going to SFO (especially flying internationally), it's your best ground transportation option.For people commuting to SF from the East Bay (or vice versa), it's an excellent alternative to driving: less pollution, less wear & tear on your car, and far lower costs.And now to kick a hornets nest:Isn't it ironic that Marin County, with all its self-proclaimed progressive, environmentally-conscious liberal residents, refused to have BART expanded there? Nah, driving solo across the GG bridge in a Ford Excursion is a much better alternative. Gotta love ECINO people (Environmentally-Conscious In Name Only). Their mouths are truly where their wallets are."
484,3,"Feb 28, 2017","BART Worked Reasonably WellWe needed to go from point A to point B, than back again.  It was pretty easy, and we were able to get where we needed go in a timely fashion.  Fortunately, we are pretty experienced when it comes to using mass transit, so we are able to roll with most challenges presented by each system.For people who do not use mass transit often, BART can be a bit challenging.  Getting through the stations is pretty straightforward.  Determining which train is the correct one, however, is not.  Making matters worse is the fact that the trains are not marked on the inside to let you know which train and/or route you're actually using!Now, you may say, ""The announcers let you know all that information.""  I cannot argue for or against that point, despite having heard the announcers at regular intervals.  What I did hear - and I quote - was, ""fwjenlkjf Iwru bkjhsJIOETP FBAmoa njpeahm;l,"" and other announcements that were equally impossible to understand.Bottom Line-If you know your way around mass transit, you'll be fine.If you are new to the experience, don't be afraid to ask staff for help.  They are both helpful and friendly."

490,1,"Mar 31, 2007","[Update: I am currently living in Paris, France. I had to reduce my rating of BART to one star after my experience on the Paris Metro. (Yelp doesn't support the accent over the e, alas. ) Allow me to explain: In Paris a train comes to the station (one can be found within walking distance from anywhere) within 5 minutes, max (usually you will wait three minutes for the next train). It will cost you 1.5 Euros to get anywhere in Paris if you buy a ticket or you can buy a monthly pass for 53 Euros which gives you unlimited rides on the Metro and also gives you unlimited rides on the buses and the RER. Price goes down if you buy the yearly Navigo pass. People who work at the Metro stations are super nice and never have attitudes. (French) riders on the trains are nice, reserved and clean. The trains manage to go incredibly fast without ever creating a screeching noise so loud it almost makes your ears bleed. Also, people in France don't poop on the trains. And, even if they did, unlike on BART here is no rarely cleaned carpet to sop-up, collect and store all the blood, vomit, feces, urine etc. which constitute all those stains on the floor of the BART. I'm sure the carpet on BART was an attempt to find a material to absorb with painful screeching noise - a result of engineers with no knowledge of aerodynamic design.The metro system was built before 1920. The BART was built between 1964 and 1972 -- by then engineers had gotten us to the moon! and even with all the good examples of trains in the world BART planners still couldn't get it right!!!]  Original review: The Best Night Ever for BART was the night the new De Young Museum opened. There was also some bridge construction going on so the BART ran all night long. Even at 3:00 in the morning there were something like 10,000 people on the grounds of the De Young waiting to get in or just hanging out.Coming home to Berkeley at 4:30 in the morning the whole train was packed to the gills. There were hipsters and business people and drag queens and gang-looking kids and college students and distinguished looking seniors all crowded in together returning home from a night on the town. Suddenly the whole car broke out together in a rendition of some song -- I feel like it was Elton John or James Taylor -- something very 70s cheesy AM radio, and it was all so magical.The BART should run all night. I will never understand how this can be a ""World Class City"" when you cannot even stay out until 2am unless you have 40 bucks plus tip to get back across the bay in a hard-to-find taxi, or want to drive drunk. A friend of mine who is really into Railroad History recounted to me a story that the reason BART is such a money pit and cannot afford to (stay running at night, finish looping the bay, charge us compassionate fares, etc.)  is because when it was first designed (the business? the people? the government? I forget this essential fact!) wanted it to be designed so that it could never be annexed by (other?) businesses and used for hauling materials, so they designed the rails to non-standard size and designed cars that couldn't use standardized parts. So everytime something breaks down it has to be specially ordered and manufactured, unlike Caltrain. (sp?) -- If they had just used standardized train parts like NYC, etc. then they could afford to run and charge less. I am willing to believe this story is true until I am confronted with contrary evidence.UPDATE: Go read the Bay Area Rapid Transit page on the Wikipedia - there it outlines the whole story as to what I tried to say above.The Wiki also had this funny note:""Peter Hall, author of the book Great Planning Disasters, describes BART as one of the sensational planning disasters of the 20th century, alongside the Anglo-French Concorde and the Sydney Opera House."" -- ha!On a final downer note, TWO times I have seen coiled piles of actual human poop on the carpet of the BART. I don't know what they clean that carpet with but I hope it is CDC approved.It makes me want to have one of those CDC/Hot Zone/Nasa/Silkwood decontamination showers installed at the door to my house."

If you've been on his train, you know what I'm talking about, and I must say it's a pretty awful way to end your day hearing him go ballistic on us paying passengers.  Someone needs to talk to this guy so that he can chill a little.OK, enough of a rant.  I'm actually typing this as he yells at me, so that's what's in my head as I type.

He puts his ticket through a bunch of times and the computer won't let him out.  So he starts talking with the attendant about the problem.  The argument was starting to get pretty heated, but thereafter I went upstairs to wait for my train.  Found out it 'twas about 19 minutes away, and I thought that argument would get quite interesting.  I headed back downstairs to observe. The guy is yelling back and forth at the BART lady about how it's bad Karma that she won't let him out of the station.  He still owed some cash on his ticket.  He's yelling at her saying that he's gotta pick up his wife who has a flat tire (he was obviously flambouyantly gay). She finally tells him that she's calling bart police and eventually a bunch of F and C words start driveling out his mouth.  Then he walks away in a huff with his hands on his hips and says ""...annnnnd you have BAD teeth!!!"". He goes to sit down and wait for I dunno what.  Eventually this 300lb thug lookin black dude is like ""hey man, you need a couple bucks, I can spot you"". Flambouyant guy comes over and is sayin ""Oh thank you thhhooooo much give me your card, and I'll mail you a check as soon as I get home"". Thug guy reaches for his wallet, and instead of pullin out a few singles, he smashes the guy in the face with his fist as hard as I've ever seen anyone get hit.  He's like ""yea, that's what chu get for flippin out in my BART station!""  Thug jumps over the turnstyles and hops out of the station. I'm already almost pissin my pants at this point because I'm such a pussy, cowering in the corner and calling 911.  I mean Flambouyant was annoying as hell and quite obviously in the wrong, but I thought he was gonna need to pick up some of his teeth off the ground after that hit. Have you ever called 911?  I got some nice elevator music and the ol ""thank you for your call, you are a valued customer, please wait 25 minutes while we sit here whackin off"".  About 26 minutes later I finally get an operator.  I tell her I just witnessed an assault at the BART station, and there was a guy there that was in serious need of help. Hang on while I dial bart police. More elevator music... At this point, I grab the next train, and the operator finally picks up just before I hit the tunnel into Oakland.  I'm tell her ""look, the emergency is prolly over, but it would be nice if they sent a cop over to Macarthur. Next BART story... I got some news from home and I was overcome with emotion. So I'm really on edge (usually my strongest emotion is hunger -- WHEN i'm not menstruating).  I hop on BART after a 12 hr day and head home.  This skinny urkel lookin guy hops on my train, and starts playing the bongos on the car door with his two pepsi bottles.  I put up with it for a few minutes, then he starts bangin through the aisles with the bottles.  I first glance at him with a ""fuck you"" face, then ask him ""HEY ARE YOU GONNA SHUT THE FUCK UP ANY TIME SOON?????"" He's stops dead in his tracks and says ""WHAT R YOU GONNA DO ABOUT IT"" and waves his hands at himself as if to tempt me to beat his ass. Walk up to him look him square in the eye, nose to nose, and I say ""NOTHING, JUST SIT THE FUCK DOWN AND STOP BOTHERING ALL THESE PEOPLE"".Then I cowered into the other train. GO BART, YOU ROCK!"

As if it wasn't bad enough that you won't extend out to Pinole and I have to drive to El Cerrito and spend 10 minutes looking for parking so that I just barely miss the train to San Francisco, and then I have to wait another 15 minutes for the next train, THEN to add insult to injury, a train gets stuck in the Transbay Tunnel putting my train at a dead stop.  And what happens when it's 7:30am in the morning and you're sitting in a stationary train?  That's right, YOU FALL ASLEEP!  And then what happens?  YOU MISS YOUR STOP!!!!  Then, to add salt into your open wounds, the trains are backed up from the initial train stuck in the Transbay Tunnel and it takes another 20 minutes to go back to where you should have gotten off the train in the first place.  Gas rating: 5When I said everything gives me gas, that includes stress, and this event was super-unbelievably stressful to me.  All in all, it took me 2 hours to go 25 miles.

Yes, that's me standing by the stainless steel pole on an almost empty train, germaphobia levels at orange alert. On the other hand, BART is generally reliable (on-time), easily accessible, and allows me to trek into the City without having to deal with traffic congestion, the toll, dumb asses who drive in the FastTrak lane who don't have FastTrak and hold everyone who does have FastTrak up while they merge into Cash Only lanes, and of course - exorbitant city parking fees.

On the other hand, I've noticed more train cars are having vinyl seating instead of cloth so maybe they are working on that?ASIDE from all that, I have been on many different trains around the country and world.  In comparison, BART is by far the most comprehensive.  There is only one platform so all you have to do is figure out the correct side to go on.  They are very organized for events of all kinds and have longer trains available at these times.  The waiting time is so minimal that if you miss a train, you aren't screwed because of the frequency of trains (unless of course you are transferring to another train or maybe late for work).All in all, this is a very efficient way to travel and I am very grateful to live in a place that has a train system like this available.  I don't even want to think about all the money and time I would have wasted in my life by driving instead."

But Bart needs to extend BART service to Livermore and Hercules. I thought the BART extension to Livermore would have already happen by now. Also I heard on the news some time ago that a Hercules a city council member or the mayor talked about wanting to extend BART service to Hercules. It never happened. BART needs to get it's future projects started because a lot of those future projects seem to be lies.

Do you think if someone reads a bad review, they'll take the *other* subway system? Tips about avoiding panhandlers or weird station features would be useful, but most of these 'reviews' are just inane descriptions of reviewers personal feelings.If your review isn't useful to others, it's just clutter. Validating your own existence or deluding yourself into a false sense of importance are not good reasons to post something on Yelp. Those are reasons for using Twitter."

If I find that I can't ""deal"" with BART (too crowded/too stinky/too tired) on a given day, I certainly have the option of walking, taking a cab, or stealing a car.  So yeah,  I deal with it.  It's actually my other fellow riders that greatly influence my experience....here are a few of my favorites:1) Gumby - He gets on the last train at the 16th Street and Mission station and immediately starts stretching and dangling his 6'4"" frame from the bars within the train.  This dude always wears his ""warm-up"" gear and a sweatband.  He props his legs up, cracks his vertebrae, etc. and really gets into it.  It's distracting and for some strange reason pisses me off because secretly I wish I could play on the BART jungle gym too and not give a shit, okay?2) Make Up Diva - Gets on BART looking like Sarah, Plain and Tall...gets off looking like Ru Paul. Honey, it's one thing to powder your nose or apply a little lip gloss, but if you've busted out with your vanity table and you're ""tap/swirl/buffing"" (a la Bare Escentuals), it's really fucking tacky. Get up 15 minutes earlier. Or do what I do and keep some makeup at work.3) Left Standers - the fuckers (yes, they ARE fuckers!) who stand on the left side of the escalator when I'm pistoning down trying to catch my coveted and usually-not-crowded 24th Street train.  It's during these times that I really wish pushing people out of the way wasn't illegal.  Yeah, you better believe they get the stink eye and an ancient Chinese curse.4) The Ballers - these are the men (and occasionally women) who stand *really close* to you while you are *sitting in an aisle seat*, so that their groin is generally in the vicinity of your ear/cheek.   It's almost as if they're trying to rest their balls/bits on my shoulder.  I'm generally not a fan of having my face 6 inches away from a stranger's external reproductive organs (at least, not without my consent), so I usually just offer them my seat :)This is a mere sampling of what BART has to offer...no...it's not that bad...it could be waaaaaay worse (like MUNI!).------------------------------------Update 12/29/2007:5)  BARF.

507,3,"Sep 16, 2011","You can tell a lot about a city by using their public transit system. In my travels I've noticed that the coolest, most livable and forward-thinking cities have excellent public transit, whereas in craptastic, redneck cities reliable public transportation is decidedly lacking.So where does that place San Francisco's BART system?Although overall I'd rate BART as being satisfactory, there are some aspects that make me want to sing its praises. First of all, I love how the fares are based on the total distance travelled. Unlike some cities that use a zone-based or a flat-fee system, BART allows passengers who are only going one or two stops to pay dirt-cheap fares. It just makes sense. Also, the vast area that BART covers allows commuters from far and wide to ditch their cars and get to their destination _fast_. It's the way of the future, people! Cars just AREN'T sustainable, so we may as well adjust now. But I digress...Why only three stars then? Well, firstly and most importantly, a BART station just doesn't seem like a place an average person would want to be once it gets dark. I'm normally a fairly self-sufficient and confident commuter, but when I was using BART in San Francisco I was convinced that someone would pull out a prison shank on me. The stations are just dark and sketchy. Also on the topic of stations, they didn't seem like they were being maintained properly. In a few cases the escalators weren't working, and I can't begin to tell you how infuriated I was struggling to haul a 75-pound bag up a long flight of stairs. I can't imagine how someone with physical disabilities would fare.Also, as someone who was a visitor in the city and not completely aware of exactly where I was based on sight, I found that the station names were inadequately marked. In most cities I've been in, subway/tube/u-bahn/skytrain station names are clearly marked and visible from the trains; stations are also loudly announced over the intercom systems so you know exactly how far you've travelled. On BART, I often struggled to find out if I was at my destination. In many stations, I saw no signs and although the operators would make announcements, the intercom was both a) muffled and b) drowned out by the screeching rails so I could barely make out a word. Fortunately for BART, this is a relatively quick and inexpensive fix.As a huge advocate of sustainable public transportation I applaud BART for giving Bay Area residents and visitors a reliable transportation system. Unfortunately, to continue to attract new riders and keep existing ones, there's a bit of work that needs to be done."

With BART I don't have to deal with traffic, tolls, accidents, $$$ for garages, or my most dreaded nemesis, parallel parking!  With BART, I pay and enjoy the ride. BART is my trusted friend: dependable, always around when I need them, usually on time, and willing to go anywhere with me.  I've taken BART for all sorts of reasons: whether it was going to the airport, checking out an A's game, going to a concert, meeting friends, for my many shopping trips to SF, and most importanly, when I don't feel like driving. Yes, BART can get expensive but it's SO convenient and you never have to worry about directions or getting lost.

To the city, back to the town, up to the 925, and down to Fremont; this system holds a place in my heart. I could recall all the times utilizing this for going to work in SF, to having random dates, to even the long journeys of transferring via Muni / AC Transit/ VTA  to BART to walking to ex-girlfriends' places etc.The schedule is decent, but needs to be extended because people who drink obsessively into the late hours of the morning. Know that they are prone to DUI exposure, therefore taking BART as an alternative wouldn't be that bad. Rush Hour is effective only between 8-10 am (Mon-Fri) if you have a job any later than that, then better be equipped with a book, magazine, or some kind of hand held device to keep you entertained. Sunday hours are off the wall and need to be adjusted, with the 30-45 min gaps of trains. They need to hurry up and pass the legislation to the expansion to San Jose, so I can avoid the ridiculous traffic on the infamous 880 and visit my friends in the South Bay with more convenience. Overall when I do return to the Bay Area, this is just one of the novelty things I'll always cherish despite all the bitching."
515,5,"May 8, 2007","Ya ya ya, BART has its flaws. -it could be easier to figure out if you are new to the system-it could be cheaper -it could be cleaner -they could run later -they could run to more areas-they could make the tickets NOT lose their value if you put them in your walletBUT I used it to commute for 5 months before I moved into the city and didn't have any major issues, just slight annoyances and really when I can nap to and from work and not worry about traffic, it is okay by me. I am from souther California and I can not wait for the day LA hops on the public transit train (pun intended). BART, you get 5 stars because:-you run regularly-you get me where I need to be-I don't have to pay for airport parking or taxi's,-you are cheaper then muni when traveling in the city-I can visit my friends in the East Bay and not have to worry about driving -you took my girlfriends and I from Pleasent Hill to Milbrae to go to my brothers football game and allowed us to sleep/passout from drinking on the way back. **THE MOST IMPORTANT***-you gave me a way to keep my whoops with an ex boyfriend from driving me all the way home and having the uncomfortable conversation about why we were not going to get back together!

Why stations only run along Market Street in SF? Why it only runs down to Fremont, not to San Jose? Why do they build a Dublin/Stoneridge station and not a new Livermore station instead? Why are they using cloth seats that absorb stains and odors and hard to clean and replace? Why are they still using this old stupid paper ticket system? Why they always ask for more tax-payers' money but nothing has been improved? Why why why? Comparing to other subway/transits in big cities like NY, DC, Europe, Japan and Hong Kong, BART is the worst! It is a shame to San Francisco and to Bay Area. How can one of the world's famous cities has such a bad and out-dated transit system. Whoever in charge of BART and those decision-makers should be fired or resigned. Look at what other cities offer to their citizens! We deserve a modern, smart, convenience, clean transit system, not BART!"

She would not let us in because they are two different systems... what?  Yeap!  You got to pay in cash to use the MUNI but for BART you got to buy a ticket, totally not interchangeable and not refundable.  I found out that there are 3 different transportation systems (third one being CALTrain) within San Francisco and none of their systems speak to each other.... duh?????Why cannot make a system that you can just buy one pass and it works in all of them?

But I think if they really were to update it, it would cost a lot of money.  And I'm guessing they're just waiting till they really need to renovate it to do so.  Anyhow, the reason why BART is great:1) I can get to San Francisco from Fremont for cheaper than I would if I were to drive (With today's current gas prices + the crazy $4.00 bridge toll)2) I can sit on the BART train and relax instead of driving on the 880.Yeah, BART is kind of noisy and not the cleanest, but it is pretty good in my opinion considering how long it's been around.  I think we are lucky to even have an alternate option to driving and taking a bus (I HATE BUSSES)... And yeah, BART can be ghetto sometimes with the people that ride it, but then you see past that and all of the non-ghetto people, and business people that also ride BART.

527,4,"Mar 4, 2013","I'll throw in my modest two cents about my experience (singular) with BART. Easy, convenient, newbie-friendly.I did absolutely zero research regarding this rail system. Hopped off the plane, decided to give it a try, had about 20 minutes to catch the next train (via info collected from my smart phone), decided to go for it. (Cue Rocky theme song)I found the ticket machines confusing, and I didn't know how to otherwise find out how much to pay/where to get off the train, so I asked the woman working at the information booth. (Conversation with a stranger? Imagine!) She gave me the lowdown in about five seconds, and I was off. (Play Rocky theme song)Dragging my wheeled suitcase behind me, I quickly found a seat in front of a map of the stations, and within a few minutes I was loungin', maxin' and relaxin', reading a book. The train reminded me slightly of a system I took in Amsterdam a long while ago: quiet, comfortable, efficient. I'm sure this isn't always the case, and I saw a few suspect suspects, but I always felt safe. For about eight bucks, it was a perfect way to navigate the San Francisco streets and get a taste of the city. Love BART!"
528,2,"Feb 22, 2006","I'm sorry but every time I step past the ticket taking machine I hear that ""get down, get down"" music from Pulp Fiction in my head.  The feeling of 70s funk overtakes me and I expect to see Shaft and a bevy of girls with boas coming down the stairs. Why? Because the BART is still stuck in the 70s, the decor of the stations, the style of trains and its interior, the underground stations are labyrinth, dirty and dark looking.Hey, this is transportation, not a fashion show you say, so okay but the NYC subways get new cars, the DC metro looks like something out of the future yet we get this and somehow this gets rated the best transportation system in the nation.  What a sad statement on public rail in the U.S. is all that tells me.  The service is spotty, it doesn't run until later on the weekends which sucks if you've got a flight.  And flying out of Oakland, well, read my review of AIR BART for that.  If you don't plan for the absolute slowness of BART, AIR BART or both, you will find yourself like me, hailing a cab from the Coliseum station to the airport just to make your flight.  With its cheaper and shorter flights, OAK deserves a BART to the Airport but even that isn't enough to save the system."

531,4,"Jan 5, 2008","Ok I am totally erring on the side of the BART gods and giving this place a four instead of the 3.5 I'd like to give it. Really I depend on BART a lot (as I do VTA, CalTrain, Light Rail and the occasional jaunt on AC Transit and MUNI but hey who's saying utilizing public transportation is a bad thing). BART is an even contender heading with other Bay Area public transportation systems heading into this review and this is how I decided 3.5 was an adequate star rating:             efficiency: 4 out of 5--BART is usually on time (or within             a reasonable time frame). However, when there's a problem            at one station, there are problems with ALL trains heading in            that direction. unforeseen upside: if this was to happen to your            train under the transbay tunnel you could wind up on the news!            All joking aside, BART is well timed to commuter bus shuttles            and local bus services throughout/leading to 5 counties.             cleanliness: 2.5 out of 5, two things-don't ride the suspiciously             empty car on New Year's Day and hey, it beats MUNI.             comfort level of the trip: 3 out of 5--tip one during commute             hours, if you want to sit, always go for one of the first cars. For            every beautiful sunrise over SF in the wee hours you get five             people screaming on their cell phones, 2 homeless people             talking to you/themselves, 4 teenage girls squealing and one             guy sleeping for what feels like a dozen times over. Still it beats            MUNI.            convenience: 3.5 out of 5--during commute hours all is well. But             there is limited service between the lower East Bay and San             Francisco at night and on Sundays. As some have pointed out            they do close before the bars do, so that can kind of suck.             those creepy voices (the soft robot voice/robot boy voice) and            the flashing minute signs: 2 out of 5. Creepy. Plus when the             attendant or station agent blares across the loudspeaker you            can really detect the rhythm of the electronic voice afterwardsFrom when I use to have a car, I do remember that the parking lots I use to park in (Millbrae and Fremont) were both well lit and quite safe.I also feel like I get more than my fair share of late trains right in a row but that's a whole other story...."
532,5,"Nov 11, 2012","Love BART. Easy, few delays, nice routes, good schedules.  They are also pretty safe and have a lot of BART police on hand and for ride alongs.The only small complaint is they aren't the cleanest, but this is true f a,, public transit.  Technically there is no food or drink allowed onboard, and if people listened to this then I think it would be great, but people don't listen most of the time, causing messes.  Also, the annoyance of people feeling we need to listen to their cell hone conversations or loud music gets old, but that isn't BART, just rude people.Overall, a great public transit service."
533,3,"Nov 24, 2006","A great big ""eff you"" to BART for expanding to SFO. It created an unholy balance by forming 3 types of trains heading South of San San Francisco. The ubiquitous ""SF Daly City"", nearly extinct ""SF Colma"", and the hated ""SF SFO Millbrae"" now dominate the south of Balboa Park landscape.Do we needed a train to SFO? It's an ok idea, but in my opinion the shuttle thing worked fine. We certainly did not need that hundred million dollar glass and concrete farce we call the SFO station. How many people use the South City and San Bruno stations anyway? You can count them in the tens.And to further drive home a point why even penetrate San Mateo county or take BART to San Jose? Those snobs are not enlightened enough to take public transportation Those prissy princesses are too busy driving around in S.U.V's or taking their beloved Caltrain (like omg! yay caltrain! let's go drink appletinis and shop for Coach bags) too appreciate BART. Effete noveau rich bourgosie bastids! They don't belong in our shining city on a hill!Sorry for turning it into a class war, but I must admit I do get a personal joy when I see a Caltrain rider's face writhe in horror when they enter the BART train. (HA! Go back to Atherton!)The point is: Don't shove BART into places it wasn't mean't to go. Screw the South Bay. They stole the A's and they're a bunch of Prissies anyway. Bart should expand North and east reaching out to the hardworking, taxpaying coutnies of Alameda and Contra Costa. The Richmond line should extend north and connect to Rodeo and Hercules  with a possible link to Vallejo. TONS of people commute from Vallejo and would clear up the northern corridors.That hate tirade aside, I do appreciate the SF Richmond line (or as I like to call it ""the Blue Ball Express""). Thank you for saving me the costs of living in Berkeley  to school by allowing me to commute form home.SHut down SSF, San Bruno, and Millbrae trains now! Long live the Colma line!""Es ist alles lcherlich, wenn man an den Tod denkt"" - Thomas Bernhard."
534,3,"Feb 3, 2011","I take the Bart from Downtown Berkeley or Rockridge to Daly City and back 3x a week for work, with an occasional 1 or 2 extra trips to Powell for shopping.Pros:Gets you to most of the major cities in the Bay Area, at a speed competitive with driving (especially since driving = sitting in traffic most of the time here), without requiring any worries about tolls or parking.Efficient. The Bart is more reliable than a bus because it will actually show up at the time it's supposed to.Clipper card + 6.35% HVD autoload!Train conductors stick half their body out their window to make sure those automatic doors aren't closing before everyone's in.Cons:Lots of sketchy people on the BART and it sucks to have to sit near them.Questionable cleanliness of the cloth seats and carpeted floor.Expensive, though if traveling to SF, not as expensive as paying the $6 Bay Bridge Toll and THEN trying to find and pay for parking.Sometimes the BART is laggy or makes random stops to let other trains pull ahead/get back on schedule/maintenance.Most BART stations have broken escalators, so expect a lot of running up and down stairs.Crazy crowded anytime people want to go to work / leave work from Powell, Montgomery, and Embarcadero.Once, I saw a drug deal happen right in front of me.80% of the female BART window workers are always angry.Supposedly, a $250 fine for eating/drinking on the BART.Closes at midnight so you can't stay out too late (a la Cinderella).Sometimes some lines just don't run and you have to take another one and transfer."
535,2,"Apr 22, 2008","Oh, I hate BART.  BART's like that ""friend"" that has a crush on you but you hate and only hang out with because they're the one person you know with a car.  Except for BART doesn't like you that much, because it charges you lots of money (like $1.50 to go 8 blocks!), doesn't take you very close to where you want to go, has an old car that stinks, and also picks up all kinds of crack addicts on the way. But it's the easiest, cheapest, and most guilt-free way to get to the airport. Same can probably be said about the east bay."
538,3,"Feb 24, 2011","Well BART where to begin?  Hm... Oh, first, people it's just BART not The BART.  Adding ""the"" makes you seem like a tourist.  *Done being a jerk*Okay so I took BART nearly every single day of my college life.  That means from August of 2006 to December of 2010 I was on the Fremont/Daly City train.  This being said I've got plenty of experiences that create a reason for this review to be middle of the road 3 stars.Most days I didn't have a problem.  I got on in the morning, was at school on time, and then on the way home I got back fine.  Also most days I was on a packed train to and from because I was often on with the commuters so I've never had much of a negative experience regarding BART patrons during those peak times.  However, you bike riders- bikes aren't allowed during peak commute hours so if you're docking stars for people not giving you any room, you may want to think about when you're getting on the train.Though I can't say my time riding BART was without problems.  This is where the system seems to completely fall apart.  If there is a single issue- not matter what size it is- the system comes to a screeching halt.  I guess that's what happens when you've got one track for every line going into the city/east bay cities.  Switch problem?  You're stuck.  Equipment problem?  You're stuck.  In the tunnel from Lake Merritt to West Oakland on any given day?  You're stuck.My biggest issue I've ever had was when there was a fire in the Hayward yard and I was stuck in 100% packed trains from start to end everyday for over a week.  The trains were literally completely full at the first station and cleared out only a few stops before mine which made for some terrible mornings.My other issue was having to get up mega early to get to school on time since it takes at minimum 45 to get from Fremont to Daly City and the Fremont station has very limited parking (I'll do a review for this station later).  Granted this was fine for me because without having to drive I could do homework, sleep, play video games, listen to music, read, and so on.But what of the people.  As I said the commuters are just fine.  Though when I started school late or finished early I was often on trains with rowdy kids, the most ghetto people you can find, and the pan handlers.  I've even had to ride it later at night (7, 8 pm or so) for when I had late classes.  However, Contrary to what you'd think the late trains are actually quite safe.  Most of the people on the train are the people who stay late at the office, people who are exhausted, and people coming/going out.  Though the stations at night are a different story.  While nothing ever happened to me in the stations or on the train, having to get off and transfer at an Oakland station wasn't the best feeling.  So overall it depends on what time you're on the train.  Same goes for station agents.  Some are totally helpful and amazing, some treat you like utter crap.My other problem is that they stop direct service to some places from the city in the evening.  This meant having to transfer trains at 7:30 most nights I had late class so I could get home.  It's not like no one's going that way, but they still end direct service pretty early.The trains themselves are decent.  They are phasing out the carpet in favor of textured floors to increase traction for when it's rainy and so they can be cleaned easier.  The cushioned seats are getting pretty ratty in most trains, but it beats sitting on plastic for an hour.  My biggest complaint is the temperature control in the cars.  Each car has a mind of it's own so some cars will be blazingly hot while others will be freezing- all on the same train.  There are even times where it'll be 80 outside and the heat is on in the car or it's freezing and rainy, but the AC is on.  I just don't get it...Lastly, price.  It is not cheap.  From Fremont/Union City to Daly City is pretty much 12 bucks roundtrip.  There really aren't any discounts for students so I was stuck getting the $48 ticket for $45 at Safeway... woo... I saved 3 bucks... They do offer free transfers for Muni at the Daly City station, but you're better off using SFSU's shuttle.  It is cheaper than gas + bridge + parking + parking tickets, but it's still steep.  Yes they need the money, but you'd think they could do something for students.So that is my mega long review for BART.  It's a necessity for some of us, but it is pricey and you do not want to be stuck when there are problems."
539,1,"Oct 6, 2010","I think BART is awful. It stinks, the trains are filthy, it's loud, stressful, crowded and people don't care about others throughout their commute. They step on feet, push others around, step on my dog's feet, usually don't even get up for elderly customers or disabled guests. I think this my most negative review I have written so far..But well.."
540,1,"Nov 3, 2005","We will be having a really, really big earthquake here. Whenever, it's just inevitable. So, if you are in the transbay tube, you will most likely die. The tube will disconnect from the bay floor and break away from it's moorings on one end of the bay or the other ... or break into smaller bits.If you are on the raised tracks, they are predicted to topple over and drop train cars some 30 feet to the ground.Also, the stations are expected to flood all the way to 24th Street Station. Not all of a sudden or in a matter of minutes, but ... they will.How do I know this? Bart's own safety analysis!Bart? No thanks.UPDATE: Now that they are fixing all the overhead lines and so on ...is it still so funny, eh? Heh?!Also... too damn expensive. Bad hours. I want a system like the Metro in Paris. Damn..."
541,5,"Sep 3, 2006","I Give The BART 5 Stars for being really convenient when you fly Into SFO!!  So Instead of using an Airport taxi with crazy fees or Renting a Car to face crazy traffic and tolls. I Choose The BART! Living in the Seattle area and having only a Monorail to and from the Space Needle. The Bus System is great and all but, I wish the SEA area had something like this.This is my favorite form of Transportation Gateway tool to The City."
542,4,"Apr 27, 2009","It may be ghetto but it works and it's cheap. It's easy to use too. I'm from So Cali where our public tranportation sucks or seems like it is rarely in existence.I was originally supposed to land at SFO but the plane needed to make a landing at Oakland airport because it has a longer landing strip there. Technical difficulties, bleh! Anyways, I had to get into SF city and didn't want to pay a billion dollars by taking a cab. I proceeded to hop on the BART at the coliseum location. GHETTO FAB! and use caution please. Be aware of your surroundings and valuables. Friggin' Oakland!Anyway, it was a 30-45 minute ride or so but it got me to where I needed to go for under $6 so I was happy I made it there in one piece. The BART is pretty cool. Even though in LA we have the metro subway, it just doesn't seem as efficient as the bay's BART.BTW, I don't blame the BART for that one incident where the officer shot the suspect. That was all on the person and not the transportation system. This review has nothing to do with that ordeal."
543,3,"Jul 11, 2007","Okay, this is just an excuse to share a funny anecdote. My real feelings about BART are that as much as I like the idea, it's next to useless because there are not enough lines to call it Rapid Transit. One line through SF? Get real!My friend is enroute  to work at 6 AM. Behind him, some guy is checking out all of the potential ringtone options on his cell phone -- much to the annoyance of everyone around him. A distinguished-looking elderly gentleman sitting next to my friend, who has been quietly reading his paper, suddenly turns to him, and in a voice loud enough to be heard  by everyone close by, says: ""Interesting article in the paper today. It's about a short story contest.""My friend says cautiously, ""Is that right?""The man then says, ""Yes, they had to pick from hundreds of entries. What's really fascinating is the subject of the story that won.""""And what was that?""""It was a about some guy who kept  fucking with his ringtones on BART at 6 AM until someone murdered him.""My friend said the rest of the ride to work was blissfully quiet."
544,1,"Mar 8, 2017","For some reason the wizened council of BART elders has decided that the city of Pittsburg (pop. ~66k) should have a BART station while San Jose (pop. ~998k) does not.  They claim to have a plan to build a station in downtown San Jose but their timeline has taken longer than the moon landing project and the god damn trans-continental railroad (literally; it's taking longer than to build a train track across several states with picks and shovels than tens of miles with modern earth moving equipment).  Also, for some reason cars and airplanes can drive themselves but trains can't."
545,3,"Jul 24, 2006","Do you ever wonder why the signs are so dark on BART?  you can not even read them, no matter how routine you may be, you still can not read the signs and the fear of missing the stop sets in, not only can you not see the signs the walls are so dark, you can not read anything, bart is very interesting, the seats look like they came out of airplanes and the back cars on hot daze and like fog banks...no wonder why so many police patrol bart, you just cant see...Does someone want to camaign for a brighter bart:)Neon flourescent lights would be PERFECT:)"
546,1,"Aug 22, 2007","When I moved here I thought this was a *REAL* public trans system, like in Chicago, NYC, Tokyo. But it sucks. Clean yes, but it doesn't run overnight. And the trains aren't very frequent. Commuting to SF State really blows. I take rideshare or MUNI when possible.Or Flexcar."
547,1,"Jun 27, 2011","It never EVER fails: 1. Disgustingly dirty seats. Like, ew. For reals. 2. Random people who appear homeless (this, I have no issue with) who insist on sauntering from section to section singing, panhandling, yelling at imaginary foes... So irritating.  And somehow, the seat next to me must always look extra comfy. Cuz he/she always ends up there. 3. Fights. It seems like every 3rd time I ride BART I witness a trash-tastic encounter of one sort of another, which almost NEVER ends with law enforcement showing up. How come I see a million BART Police cars on the roads, but NONE actually AT BART?! Again - Irritating. I would rather drive circles for an hour looking for parking in SF than ride BART."
550,2,"Oct 10, 2010","South Florida public transportation makes the BART look like the pinnacle of public transportation, but this rating is not based on comparing public transportation systems, otherwise, NYC would take the cake.The good thing about the BART is it is usually on time and when it is not on time BART is good at informing its riders of the delays.The bad stuff about BART....hmmm.... where to begin, where to begin. The BART needs renovation to weather an earthquake because we all know if the major when hits the BART is hopeless. Renovation is also needed to add comfort for riders. How about accommodating the bike riders with a bike rack on the BART? Better seating? More poles to hold onto? Another negative about BART is it is expensive, very expensive. Their deals for college kids stink and they should consider students, who are broke. Why can't they make a deal like MUNI?Third, the BART seems to me it always breaks down. If I had a nickel for every time I was late due to a malfunction I would be rich enough to drive into the city. Hmmmm (thinking)....not really, but you can catch my drift.Lastly, How about the BART operate longer hours, so people from East Bay have a more affordable way to get home from going out in the city.The BART works, but definitely could work more efficiently."
551,4,"May 8, 2006","Please see Muni Review. P.S.Dear BART,Please work out a Fast Pass I can use to cross the Bay. I'd go $150 for one of those. Regards,Gene"
552,5,"Nov 23, 2010","I love BART. It's fast. It's easy. It's moderately priced. When the train enters tunnells, the tinted windows allow you check out cute passengers and then you can catch yourself being caught checking them out. Then there's that quick darting of the eyes. You're fooling no one. lolWhat prompted me to finally write a review was the last time I was on BART. It was just before the World Series. The Giants were playing the Phillies. It was the night that the Giants went to the World Series. I'm getting choked up just thinking about that night. Anyway, BART was packed and there was that one passenger who tries to keep the doors open and holds everyone up. Well, a conductor called that passenger out and told him ""don't be selfish. There are other people on the train that need to get somewhere.""When we started to push towards the door to exit, a couple of the other passengers as well as myself said to our friends ""don't be selfish,"" and shared a laugh. Awesome. Reason #987973247 why I love San Francisco."
553,3,"Apr 29, 2012","SFO to Downtown? I prefer BART. My last cab ride from SFO was one of the craziest rides I've ever been on. I was more stressed from the cab ride than I was from dealing with the TSA and the flight. BART eliminates the drama. Get on, get there, get on with your life. Outside of SFO and downtown SF the station locations kinda suck, the TVM's can be a pain to use, but overall it's not bad. That being said I feel the Chicago Transit Authority's EL system, even though it's much older kicks BART's derriere in so many aspects. 3 stars. It beats going into near cardiac arrest from the cab drivers from hell."
554,4,"Nov 9, 2007","Aaaahhh BART.  somedays i work in the east bay, some which i take BART, some which i drive. and let me tell you (perhaps you already know) bay bridge traffic blows. not to mention the glorious nimits 880 freeway. north or south, whatever time of day, it sucks pretty bad too. i always regret it (driving that is) when i could be spacing out, reading a book (cause does anyone have any OTHER time to READ these days?), people watching, etc. instead...stuck in a wasteland of cars while BART is whizzing by.no public transit system is perfect (hence the 4 stars). yes, some of the cars are smelly. the fabric cushy seats sure SEEM comfy....but actually when you think about how many people have sat on them (and done who-knows-what on them) you might opt to stand. but all in all, the trains are usually on time and go to lots of places (most of which i personally never need to be but that is besides the point). i don't know why they can't run late trains for those who live in the east bay and wanna party in the city. or for the ""off-chance"" you find yourself partying in the east bay and live in the city...whoops, did i say that out loud?"
555,4,"Jan 7, 2006","Having used public transit in the other major subway areas: Paris Metro, London Underground, New York, Boston T, and DC, I have to say BART does a good job. Compared to most of the other systems, BART is efficient, relatively quiet, and (perhaps unique to BART) carpeted, which does cut down on the noise in the cars. On the downside, the station staff vary greatly in motivation and attitude. Downtown Berkeley staff are helpful, Powell St morning staff are, at best, retarded. I'm a cyclist, which means that when I exit, I have to run my ticket through, exit without the bike, re-enter through the gate, and then exit with my bike through the gate (the standard routine if you have a bike). On two occasions, the guy who works at Powell St has chased after me for failure to pay (yes, I did pay, thank you very much). Really, I love being treated like a criminal. A real upside to the BART system, despite the Powell St experience, is free valet bike parking in Downtown Berkeley. Luxury! They have a bikestation that holds 150 bikes near the ticketing area. You give them your bike and get a ticket. At the end of the day, you retrieve the bike from them. That's it. It means I can bike commute and not worry about having to take my train on board (bikes are banned at peak hours). The system is safe and fairly well patrolled -- I've never had a problem in the seven years I've commuted on it. Returning from the city at midnight is no big deal either. I do wish BART ran until 2am. The last train to the East Bay is around 12:30, which means if you want to go to the city to see a late show, you'll need to drive. Would I rather drive than commute on BART? Heck no. BART is a great service. It's not as quiet as the DC system, and the maps aren't as cool as the London Underground, but it's miles better than the Boston T and I'm grateful that it's here."
556,5,"Jul 3, 2007","Three stars for BART?  Obviously NONE of these people take MUNI who provide a low rating.  It will do no good to give extensive justification for my rating other than to say: it runs on time - all the time - with very few exceptions.  MUNI is exactly the opposite.  'Nuf said!Oh yes, one thing: I lived in San Francisco for over 25 years, until about three years ago.  If I lived in the extremities of the BART line, I would probably complain about the fact that BART does not have and cannot easily accommodate express trains - at least currently.  There don't seem to be many complaints about that though."
557,3,"Jan 1, 2008","Compared to MUNI, BART is 100% awesome. Otherwise, not so much.I don't understand why BART continues to raise their fare prices, yet they don't really do anything with that extra money other than pay their drivers the highest salary of any transit agency. Sure, whenever I've needed to take BART to work or to an appointment the train arrived on-time and everything was fine, but what about running until, oh I don't know, 2 AM? How about cleaning your train seats more often? How about making BART stations in the East Bay a little more safe? How about not making me rearrange my schedule to get home from work/school because I can't bring my bicycle on your stupid trains during rush hour?As a transit system that can get me from point A to point B, it's not bad. Unless someone kills themselves by throwing themselves onto the tracks or the train catches fire (both of which have happened to me while on BART), you are on-time. I appreciate that. Now how about using the extra money you jack from me and use it to run later, allow me to use bring my bike during rush hour, or not have to step over the homeless just to get to school. I'd appreciate all of them, but at this point I will gladly take one."
558,3,"Aug 12, 2010","For an American urban region, BART is a good and efficient service to get around. Thank GOD they built this so long ago, can you imagine the bay area without it?It's not the nicest transportation system in terms of aesthetics, in that the seats are disgusting and dirty and the trains screech extremely loudly when traveling, but it gets you places so phuck it."
559,4,"Mar 25, 2011","BART to me stands for BAD ASS RAPID TRANSIT.  I think Bart is amazing, i grew up in Sacramento and they apparently don't believe in public transportation let alone a somewhat high speed train.  I don't know what i would do with out BART. How else can you get from West Oakland to the city in less than 7 minutes for $3.10?  How would i get home from Rockridge after a big night of drinking?  BART is extremely efficient and damn cheap.  The trains are absolutely disgusting when it comes the cleanliness. They definitely need to replace all of the seats with plastic ones, that way they can wipe them down and sanitize them occasionally.  I believe this is in BART's plans and should be completed by 2013.To all the people bitching about BART, shove it.  BART could not even exist and then think about how much you would be complaining."
562,5,"Mar 18, 2012","5 Stars * * * * *I know a lot of negative things can be said about BART but there is also one simple awesome fact and on that fact alone am I rating BART 5 Stars.Awesome transportation system that can zip me close to where I want to go if I so choose to use the system. I would way rather ride the BART then the CalTrans any day!I'm also looking forward to BART extending down in to the South Bay area of San Jose. Once that happens we truly will have a BART system that covers the entire San Francisco/San Jose/Oakland Bay Area.I think far too many people dog a system because of things people do or don't do, but as a whole the BART transportation system is awesome. I've ridden BART from many of the stations from Fremont to Oakland to San Francisco and I've loved it. I've also caught the BART from Milbrae & Daly City. BART is way cheaper then parking and easier on my car and easier on the pocket book."

BART.What idiots said ""Let's use carpet and plush seating for thousands of people to use everyday so that it can constantly reek of BO, piss and shit!""BART.BART is so inconvenient that I would rather sit in rush hour traffic for an hour and a half and search for parking for 30 minutes than have to rely on it to get me anywhere."
565,3,"Oct 10, 2012","At the moment BART trains are decked out with stickers boasting 40 Years of Service. It shows. Really, though - this transportation system is showing its age. I wouldn't use BART if there was another option. There isn't another option and they know it so, hey, why should they try harder? As it stands it sure as hell beats driving into the city. Being able to get on and (usually) get a seat, kick back and just zone out for 45 minutes is usually worth the occasional hiccup. Thankfully, BART has finally started to replace some of those old, filthy cloth seats with new, vastly superior vinyl ones. Having seats people aren't afraid to sit on is a great big step in the right direction. The fact that they are only now just starting this process shows what a stranglehold BART has on the Bay Area transit system, though. Let's remove all that disgusting stained carpet while we're at it. How was this not done decades ago? It makes it easier on the BART cleaning crews as much as anything. BART certainly isn't perfect - especially on weekends whenever they're doing maintenance. The delays can really chew into your day. Trains are mostly on time, but there's always problems here and there. I haven't used a public transportation system that doesn't encounter these problems though. When you're dealing with machines things are bound to go wrong. And in the case of rush hour service, frankly I'm amazed it runs as smooth as it does. While it is getting better if you were to reduce a BART train to its essence it is basically a rolling can of germs. But most of the time it is worth riding with the germs so you don't have to pay for parking, or worry about traffic, or how many drinks you have at the game. Hey, it's public transport - if you're expecting perfection you're bound to be disappointed."
566,1,"Nov 14, 2016",I am a heavy commuter from the east bay and I always experience a major delay which I really find annoying. It's fine to have some delays here and there but it's been ridiculously too many! I don't think these clowns value passengers time at all.
567,3,"Aug 12, 2006","It's no NYC subway but it get's you to certain places in the Bay Area well enough. I'm all for public transit but when you have to take three different systems to get from San Jose to San Francisco (and get around the cities), it's frustrating enough to make me drive. They should have built this sucker out extensively when they had the chance. Now if it ever happens it's gonna cost a lot of money and cause a lot of disruptions. Sigh."
568,5,"Mar 16, 2012","What a wonderful train station. I go up to San Francisco periodically and find that staying in San Bruno or Milbrae, and taking the train up, makes for a very easy trip, and no car problems in down town. This train station is large, open air, easy in and out and we love it every time. Clean, nice helpful people, (as I always have a question or two) Take the train and leave the car behind!"
569,3,"Oct 30, 2006","BART is ridiculously expensive, with no weekly or monthly passes like most other major transit systems.  The trains don't come as frequently as they should, and don't run late enough.  The seats are reasonably comfortable, but not very sensibly organized for commute time, with people awkwardly sandwiched between seats instead of standing and holding the railing along the edges.  And passengers can be really annoying -- for example, they will line up and scowl at anyone who cuts in from the side of the line, even when the train is 90% empty. On the plus side, you help out the environment a little by not driving, and it does span a pretty wide range of the Bay Area.  Within SF, there is a decent MUNI/bus system to get around, even to places BART won't take you.  And it's convenient to take to the OAK or SFO airports."
570,3,"May 7, 2007","Honestly I appreciate BART.  It makes commuting from Millbrae and Oakland into the city a whole lot easier for me in the morning.  But there are some things that just IRK the living hell out of me.- the seats.  if you've been on other public transit you will know that it is NOT normal for seats to have brown stains and smell like pee.  to this, i suggest converting the seats from cloth covered to plastic seats. yeah it'll be somewhat more uncomfortable but at least it'll be cleaner.- the arrangement of the seats.  as is right now, its really inefficient and can only seat a limited number of people.  japanese JR has seats that go in rows, so it fits more people into the train and more ppl can actually sit.  - not letting strange smelling people in the bart. this def needs to be worked on bc whenever there's someone smelling funny sitting in the train everyone else avoids that area for a good 15 feet. more space is lost.the prices, i suppose, are somewhat reasonable.  the transit system in DC, i think, is a LOT better, though. other than that, good timing, and i wish it ran later."
571,3,"Jan 7, 2013","The Setting:  Daily use of BART system while on project out here.  I am not here on weekends so this review is for weekdays only!On the right panel of this screen I see 6 reviews for BART and all of them are either 5 stars or 1 star....I will take a shot in the dark guess and say that the 1-star reviews likely come from non-frequent riders who have very different expectations for a public transportation system.  That being said....The Cost:  4 starsIf you compare the cost to that of cabs or driving and parking, the BART is insanely cheap.  I pay $7 roundtrip to get from Montgomery to 19th st Oakland.  The parking alone would cost me more.  It is $8 from Oakland to SFO, versus over $50 in a cab.The Time:  5 Stars (for daily commute), 3 stars (for Airport)It is MUCH quicker from SF to Oakland via BART.  It is slower than driving/cabbing from SF to Pleasanton.  It is much slower (around an hour versus 30 minutes) versus cabbing/driving to SFO.  That being said, I'd rather avoid the rental car process in this city for many reasons...NOTE: If you are traveling to a specific destination that is only accessible via one of the lines (Richmond vs Freemont vs Dublin vs Bay Points), I would encourage going to the BART website and looking at their schedule.  It is super accurate and punctual, and it's a cruddy feeling to get down there to see your train leaving and having to wait 15 minutes (or more) for the next one.The Crowd:  4 stars (during business rush hour), 1 Star (any other time)During the business rush hours if 730-9am and 5-630pm, the BART crowd is almost primarily working people, almost all keeping to themselves and wearing headphones.  Bike riders that use the BART are fairly respectful and not pushy with their equipment.  As expected, SF's substantial vagrant population takes over the BART system after-hours, using it to sleep.  They constantly pester you even if you are wearing headphones, which after these months using it, I've now had to resort to being curt with them.  I normally wouldn't but they are fairly aggressive salespeople...The Bottom Line:  This is an effective, normally time-and-money-saving method of transportation in this city, but if you have the choice, I would use other means of transit during the later evening hours (after 7 pm)."
574,4,"Sep 1, 2009","I am feeling the love for the BART. It is fast, clean and from my time on it, not overly busy. This is very unlike the tube in London, which is slow and crowded. I would be happy to use this form of transit on a regular basis.Go the BART!"
575,5,"Aug 2, 2011","Oh BART, how I love ye, let me count the ways...1. Paying for distance as opposed to flat fare is pretty genius, verging on ""DUH"", when you consider how far you're getting for the price.2. They come often, and are pretty reliable about it. Other transit systems should take a page from their notification book (Sac lightrail finally is, oh so slowly). AND they run til reasonably late hours (which is rare these days--at least coming from the town I do).3. Stations are nice, trains are clean (relatively speaking--especially considering they're carpeted and haven't changed much since the '80's).4. Most stations are connected to other transit lines, not something a lot of systems do enough of.Need I say more?"
576,5,"Jan 1, 2017","I am one of the thousand commuters who ride the trains, which are often delayed, broken and worn down. But instead of complaining, I want to offer my compliments to the everyday front-line workers there, not the ones who occupy the office suites. Whenever I go to  BART stations for assistance, the problem gets solved professionally and courteously. Whenever there is trouble on the trains with disruptive behavior from passengers, I use the BART watch app and the response is immediate. Officers are concerned and take their duties seriously. I once lost an iPad on a train and reported it.  Within a week, it was found and returned to me via the BART lost and found, and the reps there were exceptional.  Day to day, we lose sight of how old the infrastructure and equipment is, and how the people there make it successful and try their best. I appreciate what you do. Thank you."
577,2,"Dec 22, 2007","BART...The GOOD, the BAD, the UGLY.Some days, I'm glad she's around.  And other days, I wish could just dump her!The GOOD- More convenient than trying to drive across the bridge everyday.- Faster than MUNI from the Mission to Downtown SF; 5 min vs. 45 min.- Reminds me of the monorail in Disneyland.  Whee!!!!The BAD- Stops running after 12pm on the weekends.- Dirty seats and floors.  I really don't want to know what was on top of those stains.- The aromas of BO mixed in with the evenings vomit and pee and whatever else.The UGLY- Costly for public transportation.  Does the BART manager really need to be making 6 figures?  Then again, the BART drivers also make close to 6 figures and all they do is push a button all day!- Getting stuck at Bayfair station because I didn't read the fine print on the BART schedule; why does the last train only go 2 stops from Pleasanton?- Some dude who was hacking up a lung and spitting whatever into what look liked a Wall Street Journal.  Damn it was nasty!"
578,5,"Jan 14, 2008","I can't believe that during my 6 month stint in SF, I never got around to writing a review of BART, which totally saved my nondriving booty while I was out there!! My hotel was the Westin at SFO, which, while nice, was not exactly in the middle of the metropolitan mecca of SF, although I did have some great views of the runways.But, it did have a hotel shuttle to the BART station at SFO, kickass!! Got me in and out of SF as needed, and really, I have to give it 5 stars based on that alone. It's clean, it's quiet, and my mobile worked for most of the ride into the citaaaayyy!Yeah, the late night thing is way whack, I wish it was open later, but as I get around to more and more cities I realize NYC is an amazing and beautiful anomaly with cheap taxis AND a 24 hour public transport system. Of course, that only makes me love NYC more, but I can still give props to the other coast."
579,3,"Jul 24, 2015","Like other reviews before mine have stated, BART is kinda outdated and kinda expensive, but it gets the job done.  I used BART twice while in San Francisco to get to the city from the airport and back.  It took a few minutes to figure out what train to take and how much it would cost, but overall I would definitely use BART again if I ever found myself in San Francisco."
580,4,"Dec 4, 2008","Coming originally from the East coast, I was awestruck for years by the cleanness, 21st-century streamlined sci-fi modern-ness, speed and efficiency of the BART system.  The eerie howling and banshee-like screeching as the trains hurtle through blackness at lightspeed, with colored lamps flashing by, is ever so reminiscent of the end of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"".  The doors even make a cool sound when they close.  It's a world above the slow, prehistoric Boston subways in comfort, reliability, and convenience.Now that it actually IS the 21st century, though, the trains seem to be a bit worn and shabby, in need of new upholstery at least.  BART still stands up well considering it was built in the 1970's.They really badly need to update the ticket machines so there is some way to get a $4 ticket off a $20 bill and get change in bills or at least, $1 coins.  Currently change in this situation arrives as ** 64 QUARTERS ** cascading slot-machine style into a pile."
581,3,"Mar 3, 2010","I've been around the world, and I'm surprised that a city as wealthy and famous as San Francisco can have such a uniformly awful metro system. The only saving grace is that it's the only real decent subway system in the entire State, and after several months of living without one, you're like a starving man in the desert going after the twinkie. I'm also shocked at how expensive the tickets can be, especially for a working person who has to commute (I'm talking $200 a month for some commutes, and this isn't even an unlimited ticket); it's cheaper to drive even with the bridge tolls which is sad.It's very backwards when California heavily subsidizes its automotibles by building out of control freeways, then penalizes people who try to take public transpotation. The midnight closing time is also really ridiculous as well as the filthy fabric seats.I will give it three stars because there are some really nice views going from the East Bay into San Francisco. And the BART stations are some of the few places in California where people from all different classes and walks of life actually stand side by side. The people who ride the BART also tend to be thinner and healthier than car drivers."
582,4,"Jan 20, 2013","BART is pretty awesome! You can ride around SF or the surrounding areas for pretty cheap. Much better than the public transportation system we have in LA. The trains are generally clean and run until pretty late ( about midnight or so). WE use it to go from Fremont to the City pretty frequently and have almost always had a good experience. They have signs too so you know when the next train is coming. My only two problems with BART are I think it isa little expensive compared to other systems in other cities. Additionally, I don't really like the zone thing, I think it is a bit confusing and would prefer flat rate or day pass like NYC however I guess I can understand because of the space it covers and though I think it is confusing if you ride it the same route every day I guess you get the hang of it. :)"
583,3,"Jul 29, 2006","I don't know about that one. Yeah, it's reasonably fast. No, the cushiony seats don't inspire confidence. But here is what I really don't get: trying to buy a ticket, the machines don't ask you where the heck you're going,  but instead offer to print one or many tickets based on how much you've put in?  How illogical is this? This must be the first subway system in the world that does not ask you where you are trying to go, how many tickets you want to and then tell you how much you owe them. Of course, if I missed a step on their automated machines as I was rushing last night, yeah, go ahead and let me know, that will make me a smarter traveler next time."
586,3,"Nov 9, 2006","Why I like bart: I hate parking in SF, and driving in cities.The signs are nice at the stations - they tell you when the next train is coming. The signs aren't perfect though.You run later than Caltrain, and fairly frequently to boot. I like that.Why I hate bart: You get nowhere near golden gate park. In fact, you get to very little of San Francisco.You charge me a dollar fifty for a mile long ride from Caltrain Milbrae to SFO.Your schedule is imaginary. Your train screech hurts my earsMy friend Matt keeps his BART ticket next to his cell phone and the card always demagnetizes. Friends, please avoid BART tragedy, separate your card and your phone."
587,1,"Nov 14, 2006","ahhh yes, where the same blancpimpster gets on at Embarcardero, 6' , blonde, black pants, red plaid shirt, black pants, black shoes...""Can anyone spare 0.75 cents"" in each and every car. He makes about $60.Try it. The BART people must just love him as their mascot of what they can do to a captive audience. The drone gets defining when you also learn that drivers make incredible wages for the way they slam doors on some people.Oh, well, we are used to being trumped and squeezed by the powers that be. No taxpayers revolt or San Francisco Bay Tea Partiers because it is now all just enclosed water under the bridge. This system has been paid over 40 years and still places in the East Bay have yet to see a BART train in their neighborhood, because Sillyconeheads beatempunchinkins."
588,3,"Mar 2, 2012",Being a tourist - I was a teeny tiny bit  nervous about navigating the rails.It was very easy and much much cleaner then Chicago.  The train was also far less crowded then Chicago - almost peaceful in comparison.    A great cost effective way to get around.  I think a trip from the airport to out hotel in financial dist was about 9.00 - can't complain.
589,4,"Feb 20, 2008","Dear Bay Area Rapid Transit, You make me sleepy ,which is bad when I constantly miss my stops because I've nodded off. Sometimes creepy people look at me and rub their junk. Other times I look at people and silently judge them, they  may think I am trying to flirt, but I have a slight smile on my face when I am judging people so I could see how they would mistake it for flirting. Sometimes If I am feeling especially r-tarded, I like to take road trips with you. I will ride you all the way until the last stop and then go back and transfer to another train until I hit that routes last stop. You don't judge me, But I know you are watching me because I can see your beady red lights blink at me. I sometimes wish you were more expansive in the city like New Yorks subway, but then I remember riding the subway and realizing how clean and non shit and armpit smelling you are, I thank you for your cleaningnessishthing.xoxo,Dannyp.s: I think your new cars makes you look really classy"
590,2,"Jun 26, 2008","Just when I thought my commuting cost to get to work was high, behold I get snapped back into praising the Lord for all he's done for me. I too bart on Saturday from Dublin to SF, trying something different plus I hate driving in SF. It cost $10.50 roundtrip on a Saturday, then I realized those that do use bart and have to pay that ridiculous $5 parking fee. That is $15 a day during the week! No wonder people are standing along the freeway entrances waiting for cars to come and jump in the car to carpool... That is straight up BANANA's. Atleast you just have to deal with a couple people, not ALL them people who come on and off during all them stops.Come on now BART that is just milking the cow."
591,5,"May 17, 2007","I love BART. I adore BART. BART is much cleaner than most public transportation systems. I once found two tickets tucked in between the seats. One was for $5 and the other was for $10. Did I use them? You bet!One night, I was trying to buy a ticket and it wouldn't take my last dollar, so I thought I would try to add fare at the Millbrae station. The Millbrae station wouldn't take my dollar either, so I talked to the attendant, who was in a good mood and let me go through without asking for money. Then she pointed out to me that since I walk with a limp, I should get handicap prices. Handicap pricing for BART tickets is half the price! Talk about a handicap-friendly business.And the other thing I love, which is more about the people than about BART, is that I have never had to stand in a crowded train because someone always offers me their seat. I'm not in a wheelchair, and I'm not really inconvenienced by standing, but I am not going to turn down a seat! I think this shows the caliber of people who commute on BART.BART is also safe and friendly and gets cleaned every time it's in Millbrae. In the east bay,"
592,5,"May 18, 2008","This is a mea culpa to BART.Years ago I mocked you for proclaiming to be ""the best transit system in America"". I was wrong. Today, in absence of a car, you take me around the bay area as needed - gparents, Target, SFO, etc, and you do it cheaper than driving would cost. You also let me ride for free in the city with my Muni pass.And this morning, even though your schedule says you don't start service till 8am, you ran trains early for Bay To Breakers.I was wrong about you, and I apologize."
593,4,"Jul 8, 2009","On the pricey side if you ride it daily, but, for us occasional riders, BART beats SuperShuttle any day! Not to mention it beats driving through all the crazies out during big events like B2B, Pride and the like."
594,4,"May 4, 2009",The BART was a terrific alternative to hauling our asses to SF from Hercules. Sure we could've driven a van full of cousins around but I'm sure we could not have gotten to our destination in the rapid time that the BART provides.The BART certainly has better qualities than the NYC subway system- like much much cleaner. The ride was smooth and fortunately for us no haults. We all slept on the way back home.
595,1,"Nov 2, 2015","Frequent delays on schedules. Sudden decision after reach station and announcing out of service and requesting to off board. It happens very frequently now a days, which is totally unfair."
598,4,"Sep 27, 2008","For my 100th, a special shout out goes to BART! As a frequent commuter to the East bay and downtown SF, you make my life easier and less stressful. Although you may not be consistently on time, have pungent scents, and occasional crazies, you take me from point A to point B efficiently and effectively. I commend you for preventing me from any unnecessary road rage if I were to drive to Giants, As, Raiders, Warriors games, Oakland airport, and SF airport. Thanks for being there for me when my paranoid self does not want to drive in stop and go traffic! To top it all off, I love you for being so darn close that I can literally roll out of bed and walk across the street 2 minutes before my train comes and rush in on time. =)P.S. This station has an abundant amount of parking for FREE (The most I've seen so far from the stations that I've been to) and a structure to shield your car!"
599,4,"Oct 2, 2008","San Diego would be a better place with a BART like system. We have the Trolley, which I love, but it seems to move at the speed of sound, where as the BART moves at the speed of light. You don't call the trolley ""rapid"" transit, but it's good enough I suppose.The BART has many advantages though. People use it because it goes to the right areas. It's not expensive. Basically, if you're a commuter in a central business district, the BART is the only way to travel--sometimes with a combination of other mass transit enterprises.I've used the BART on occasion and I have to say, it's not the best mode of transportation in the world, but it definitely beats sitting on the Bay Bridge for an hour in traffic."
600,4,"Nov 14, 2009",".... BART's rad BUT.. I have 2 major complaints: 1.) CLEAN the cars out a little better / more frequently!!!!!!!!!!! 2.) Make ticket prices lower! They're not horrible but certainly not great, either! (Or do discounts for round trip ticket or bulk purchases!) *Those things aside, I quite fancy it a lot... And I'm DEFINITELY a fan!!! :D"
601,3,"Aug 29, 2006","If the invention of the clock is the biggest achievement of modern civilization, BART was one of its loyal adherents. A year ago, BART decided to adopt Einstein as its patron saint and proclaimed ""Time is relative"". Since then, its services have been increasingly erratic to the point where its customer ratings shoot through the roof when passengers manage to reach their destination the same day.In such a brave new world of worsening services in so many variables(cleanliness, engine trouble etc) is there an invariant, an absolute which is immune to change? The only such constant lies in the protection of redundant jobs and high paying salaries and perks of unionized BART workers."
602,3,"Aug 26, 2008","Dear BART,You are a necessary evil for those of us who need to get across the Bay. It would behoove you to make the following considerations realities:  1.  Cleaner trains.  Why, oh why, must you use upholstery on seats and carpet in your cars? If we need to give up comfort, I'd sit on cleaner plastic seating than a mystery soiled seat any day.  Visit other cities' public transit-like Portland's or even NYC's to see how much cleaner & more streamlined their trains are.  2.  Spare the Air Day.  What happened to this? Where is that West Coast progressiveness to lead our country to greener pastures & less emissions? 1 day this year versus 4 days last year?  3.  BART tickets.  If they get de-magnetized or whatnot, why are there at least 3 different responses on what you can do from agents?4.  Bonus.  You should reward passengers every now and then with an incentive to ride BART-free cups of coffee, BART rides, etc.... And who won that trip to Hawaii for filling out that lame survey anyway?Yours,A frequent BART rider"
603,2,"Sep 12, 2006","I really want to love BART, still do. I don't really mind the cost so much, but BART is really not extensive enough, so if you want to use it for your commute, chances are you will have to drive somewhere and park at a station (which is not always an available choice). And if you do have a BART Station with parking, the price can be pretty steep. You can expect to pay $84 a month for the privilege to get a parking spot before 10AM. If you live in the city, then you will have to cab or bus to a station, there isn't much available (let alone affordable) parking in the BART stations in the city.  I subtracted a second star because BART cars has these nasty cushions and carpets that are pretty gross -- you can smell the fact  that people sweat, barf, and piss on those things, and I am not sure that it is a great decision on the part of BART to have carpet and cheap cloth seat coverings. Why can't they just make it smooth plastic or metal, something easy to hose down and clean like in other major cities (e.g.: NY, London) where they have public underground transport ? BART gets another star less for its operating hours. For the most part, you have Cinderella syndrome when it come to travelling via BART -- you need to get there by midnight if you do not want to be stuck. The only time they operate long hours are when they shut down the bridge, and that is a real shame -- weekend traffic into the city suffers as a result of the short operating hours, in my opinion."
604,4,"Aug 7, 2008","Having never lived anywhere that any transit protocol other than driving was realistic, I was thrilled when I moved out to California and could take BART places. Nine years later and I'm still a pretty staunch defender. It's downsides are plenty - the lack of a late night schedule, the constant fare hikes, the occasional inexplicable delays, crowded old cars that may not be dirty but certainly aren't clean, to name a few - but once I finally made it to living in the city and working downtown, being able to knock out 85-90% of my travel needs for a $45 monthly pass is pretty great. I mean, I paid nearly $60 for one tank of gas last weekend. Given the reigns for a day I'd probably focus on non-absorbent seating, better air circulation and cooling, and providing people the means to get to or from the East Bay at night - at least 12th St to Embarcadero. I'd post the occasional reminder of good public transit etiquette so that locals aren't constantly groaning at tourists to walk left, stand right! or not stand in the ticket gate until your ticket is in hand, and in a perfect world I'd extend you all the way around the bay (even though I don't think it's your fault you're not) and cheapen your fares. Oh, and either more handles or lower overhead bars so that my girlfriend has something to hold on to please! But as a long-time rider with several thousand dollars of use over the years, I'd say you're doing a pretty decent job."
605,5,"Aug 27, 2009","Oh yeah, I did rode it again. Twice this month. From OAK via AirBus and to SFO. Still had a wonderful comfortable experience! Interesting people rides the BART as well... So it's a great place to people watch... And I just realized that BART can have as many as 10 cars per train. That is awesome! Even if it's a commuter train that runs all day long! The BART was about to go on strike on August 17 and I go back to Los Angeles on the 18th. ""Shit! Fuck me! God damn those stupid economic wreckers!"" All those thoughts (plus other not so nice thoughts) were what went through my mind when I read the front page or the Examiner on a Saturday afternoon on a MUNI train. I began to look for alternative route. Fortunately there's a bus route that does go into the airport or at least close enough. I never rode the bus because the Union leader agreed to a last minute deal which, at the time, have yet to be voted by the workers. I don't know if they agreed or not because I don't give a crap. California need to pass a law to ban public transportation workers from striking! Anyhoo. I was lucky I get to experience the BART again! *giggles*"
606,5,"Jul 5, 2009","Clean, effective, fast, frequent, and large seats! You can beat that, especially if it goes all over a metropolitan area! Maybe it works in San Francisco better than in Los Angeles because of the geographic shape... I can't wait to use it again this August!"

Everyone who gave this public transportation system 3 stars or less must be taking some dope drugs. Call me a silly wanker but BART is THE best commuting operation I've ever been a part of! I once tried applying for the BART Train Operator position, but that spot is harder than diamonds to get into... ANYWAY, I'll reiterate: BART is #1 in America imho!!!They're not that grimy (Cmon, what're you, afraid of a few germs?!? Worst affliction you can catch is possibly HIV, which is decimated soon as the virus hits O2 anyway.), they have free days (dubbed ""Spare the Air Day""), and they're the most convenient move you'll make when crossing the baaaaayyyyy areaaaaaaa!!! Additionally, AC and heating is provided. Now isn't that comfort or what? The plushy seats aren't bad either.Sure, their fares increase every year The Lord's present, but hey, when this snake is the metal beast covering the best climate case in the world, you had better shut your trap about whatever touchy feely problems you associate with it.

613,2,"Jan 12, 2010","If you've ever lived on the East coast, you know what public transportation is supposed to look like. BART looks nothing like this. It basically goes in a line up Market to the airport and doesn't get you close to half of what you want to get close to. MUNI is good for this, but try getting to the Marina on BART. Not happening. Any other transport system might branch off, and even maybe branch to the south, hitting San Jose and Redwood City, and maybe even connecting via one of the other bridges... A circle would be nice. Convenient. Or help me out and get a shuttle from Alameda. Oh, and speaking of convenient, parking is not. West Oakland seems to be the place with the best chance of parking, but most of the lots are ticketed only or so small you just circle in frustration. Build some parking lots!Also, the seats are gross."

It served me well - I was never  late to work and  the longest it ever took was about 15 minutes. Usually, it came  right away and took about 7 to get to the Montgomery Station. There are far less crazies  than Muni and a 45 dollar fastpass gets  you anywhere in  the city. I've been driving everywhere, though, and  the last time I took BART, I got busted for my free ride. It's still fast and I'd take it if I weren't driving. Way better than the bus."
615,4,"Jul 31, 2008","All i have to say is thank god for the Bart. Because when you're staying at a friends house just outside the city on a road trip up North because you're too cheap to pay for a hotel, you're also too cheap to pay for the gas to drive into the city everyday along with the parking.  And also i'm sure i would have gotten ridiculously lost in my own car. (Not that I didn't walking around, but it was easier to figure that out, at least).  Talk about convenient. Sure, it could be cleaner. Yeah, it can get pretty crowded.  But as public transport goes, this was a great idea. My trip to San Francisco wouldn't have been the same without it. Oh yeah. And when you're coming back plastered, it's pretty fun and, again, CONVENIENT. Yay for minimizing drunk driving.  Minus the fact that they stop running around 12. But whatev. The BART is cool. The End."
616,1,"Dec 15, 2009","Yes Bart is good if you've never used public transit before and have nothing to compare it to.The last time I used the subway in LA though at least it was clean, on time and a roundtrip cost me like $3! Here, sure it goes more places and is easier to drive in a city that hates cars apparently but its still NOT GOOD.Its filthy, crowded, expensive.If you want good transit go to Japan and take a few notes, BART.I mean there are tiny little things they could do to make it so much better.And since I've been riding for 6 months now, I have had a major delay at least once a week.Way to go BART.Commence sarcastic clapping."
617,1,"Aug 18, 2009","Oh I wanted to like you and give you more than 1 star Bart. But...your stations are filthy, dingy and falling apart.You are festering with the homeless and hoodlums.Your workers are rude and incompetent.Why is it $4 one way and $4 back?Why, unlike all of the other major mass transits around the country...well in other countries too (I have experienced) is there no discounted round trip fare? Why is there no monthly, weekly or annual pass?Why do all students of all grades get discounts except college students?Furthermore, every stop has a sign saying which stop it is, but no sign saying what the previous was and what the next will be.This is common practice in LA, in Japan, in Germany...Why not on the famed Bart?Take a lesson from the others, clean up like the subway in LA and get the same kind of polite, helpful workers...and while your at it, take a look at the transit systems in the greater Tokyo metro area and see how to make a truly efficient and user friendly system!"
618,5,"Jun 2, 2010","The BART is amazing, especially since it goes to SFO now!  Easy, quick, convenient, inexpensive, and they have awesome parking facilities in Millbrae!  Slowly but surely, Seattle is building a light rail system... 30 years behind the curve."
619,3,"Oct 20, 2008",Given the fact that they Bay Area is one of the epicenters of liberal politics BART should run trains every five minutes 24 hours a day 7 days a week and all for free...As it is though it's way better than MUNI in San Francisco but not as nice as CTA in Chicago...
620,3,"Jun 17, 2005","When i was growing up out in the burbs, BART was and is still the end of the line. As a family we used to take BART to oakland or the city. When i moved to SF for college, i'd take BART back home to visit my parents. BART is fairly efficient - though sometimes from one end of the line to the other it can seem like it takes forever. On weekends not all BART lines are operating so you'll have to transfer either at downtown Oakland or Bay Fair station if your heading to stations in the southern alameda county. Finally after so many years - BART has a link to SFO - though its kind of kludgey since only some lines go to the airport. With the budget problems in Cali - will BART ever make it to San Jose? It took my entire life for BART to make it to SFO - so i'm not holding my breath. Plus how can you not love the BART gates and turnstiles with that modern swoosh sound... ?"
621,4,"Aug 29, 2006","Oh BART what would I do without you?  You started to charge for parking on weekdays...what is up with that?  If you commute then you can always score a parking spot, if you arrive late, good luck finding one.  But really, I love BART because it saves me the hassle of parallel parking in the city, or better yet, shelling out megabucks to park my car in a structure.  I take BART whenever I can despite the fact that it's one of the most expensive transportation systems in the US, I will continue to ride as long as you let me.  Now if only people didn't jump on the tracks and cause stalls, you'd be the perfect solution to our traffic problems.  I know for a fact traffic here would be MUCH worse if it weren't for this lovely train.  Oh and if you ran later than midnight, you'd really be a great deal.  Sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride."
622,3,"Jan 5, 2006","BART's cool but it gets costlier every year.  I mean, I don't have a problem with that.  Once upon a time, I was dazzled by the idea that all the lands I could possibly fancy are just a trainride away. With this in mind, though, I'd like not to have to sit in a seat that smells like urine, I'd like not to have to see the man across from me wanking off behind his newsie, and I'd like for the train not to stall while operators stalk up and down the cars shouting, ""Does anyone smell gas?  Does ANYONE - smell - GAS?!!"" Because that shit kind of unsettles me.  But I guess that's life. It does have its moments, though.  One time a guy played his guitar and sang the whole ride home.  That was cool."
625,5,"Jan 2, 2008","Being away from the Bay, I forget how much I love BART, it is ridiculously clean compared to transit in many other cities around the world and the US I've been to, and you gotta love the cushy seats and the no-graffiti interiors and the lush views of the bay when I'm visiting my parents.We used it on NYE to go ONE stop to Embarcadero because my cousins were wearing heels. It was fun and great and clean and easy, although my instinct was to call a cab, my family told me that it's not as frequent as NY so we needed Bart. So easy.So, it's great for just one stop, or for 16 stops if you're going to go all the way to Fremont or to Berkeley or wherever, my experiences with Bart have always been fantastic...well, maybe except that smelly guy sat next to me, but other than that, it is the closest thing I've experienced to the perfect public transit experience, ever."
626,1,"Jul 14, 2006",BART should get no stars until it extends limited service to all stations until 2 AM on weeknights and 4 AM on weekend nights.Phooey on this. And phooey on BART Police.
627,1,"Jan 3, 2007","I ride the BART 2 times daily from SF to Oakland.  There always is the usual pan handler and homeless person roaming the stations.  There is always the odd smelling person seated close enough to smell, but not close enough to actually see or detect whom it is.  There is always the stains seat and trash on the ground, but today's morning ride to work really was an experience...The two bench seats facing each other were in visible distance from my seat.  My IPOD (a BART essential) was blasting away as I read the morning paper.  A normal day until...A man seated in one of the bench seats had his bag resting on the seat adjacent to him.  A lady (if you can call her that) proceeded to move his bag to sit down.  Keep in mind the opposing bench seat was completely empty.  The man then reacted and started yelling obscenities at her and asking her why she didn't just sit in the empty bench.  This seemed to make the women to want to sit in the seat next to him more.  He then got up and started a confrontation and spit in her face.  She then pulled out a knife and started swinging it around.  The train stopped at my stop and I carefully but swiftly exited.  Complete craziness.  I mean I've seen druggies throw up blood in the BART train before, but someone pulling a knife over a seat is just ridiculous."
628,2,"Jan 29, 2009","I freaking hate BART.  Not only is it more expensive for me than driving, but, when I try to do the right thing and take BART instead of driving to Berkeley, it usually ends up costing me even more.  The tickets get demagnetized SO easily, unlike Muni passes, and then the BART employees make me buy another ticket.  Once, I made a fuss and the BART employee offered me a form to get a refund on my demagnetized $35 ticket instead.  I filled it out, and gave her my ticket, but have not seen a dime of that money in several months.   BART makes being green a hassle.  2 stars for usually being on time."
629,3,"May 2, 2006","BART-it's better than MUNI.If I were in the marketing department at BART, that would be the tagline.  Since I'm not, let me air my grievances.  First and foremost is that there is not a monthly pass option.  Why is that?  I go to the same places every day.  I'm willing to pay extra for trips that don't go to work or the boyfriend's house, but this isn't even an option. Secondly, why is it so hard to find a ticket machine that takes credit cards?  God forbid you find a machine that miraculously does, you're screwed when your phone demagnetizes it and a huge, arduous process designed exclusively to be aggravating is involved in getting your money back (and this never happens when you have fifty cents on a ticket, it only happens when there is a small fortune on there)Now, the upside.  Fast and frequent-a train comes by about every three minutes during rush hour from Oakland to SF.  Most days, I get a seat which I also like.  No doubt iPods were created by someone who rides public transit, and I kinda, um, enjoy starting my day off on BART."
630,1,"Jun 23, 2015","Bart sucks. Anyone who's lived in the East knows how efficient a public transit system can be. The bart sucks. There aren't enough trains for passengers, the smell or are to hot and are never on schedule. My life is consistently slowed to a grinding halt because the doors won't open at a stop, the train stops in the middle of nowhere for no reason or it just rains to much and train traffic is created. WHAT is train traffic??? With all the people packed on the trains you'd think BART only has 4 trains running in the entire system. Finally, BART SUCKS!"
631,3,"Nov 3, 2009","BART is a timely, clean, reasonably efficient, reasonably quiet way to get between select major destinations in San Francisco and the East Bay during the daytime. Expansion plans to the rest of the Bay Area, which will obviate the need to transfer amongst other major public transport systems like Caltrans, may finally alleviate the requirement of owning a car in the Bay Area, but in the meantime, it's a cluster of 'planes, trains, and automobiles' for getting around town.Short answer: if BART goes precisely between your start and end, and parking is going to be a problem, take it.FYI, BART's ticket machines often fail to take credit card, and the make-shift merchants who set up shop in their stations surcharge for the payments by CC, in violation of e.g. Visa's policies."
632,3,"Feb 9, 2006","Dear BART,I have spent three years of my life commuting from the Sunset to Oakland riding on you. I feel like I might as well have lived in you. Now that I have a new job and no longer need to commute to the East Bay, I find that I don't really miss you that much. I did like that time I was on and that really cracked out guy dropped his crack pipe and everyone in the vicinity got really quiet. That was great. I have a complaint, BART. Why do you have to stop at midnight? I'm a girl who likes to go out and when my friends need to leave early in order to catch the last train, well that just makes me sad. We have had a good run, but I think it's time to move on.Love, JackieP.S. You smell kinda bad too."
633,4,"Dec 17, 2007","Oh BART... the minute I stepped foot on you and inhaled that mix of pee and feet, and heard that screaming tunnel echo that sounds like we are headed for the seventh level of hell, it felt like coming home.Why oh why can't Seattle have a mass rapid transit system like you? I will never look at a local Metro bus the same.You're quick, and cheap, and everything I ever wanted in a man. Err, I mean, in a ride. Wait.. that didn't sound much better.Seriously though-I'll miss you."
634,5,"Aug 1, 2008",Why is everything better in the Bay Area?Part if it definitely has to do with the BART system. Why drive????
637,4,"Aug 7, 2008","Everything is relative.  BART is not:* a flying car* maglev* a teleportation device* immune to natural disasters or human errorIt is also not BART's fault that some of the riders are dirty, crazy, rude, drunk, high, or too stupid to operate the ticket machines, and let's face it, better that most of these people ride BART than attempt to operate a motor vehicle (although, in truth, most of the worst offenders are probably Muni drivers).BART is:* usually on time* frequent* relatively clean and comfortable* much more pleasant than drivingThere is certainly room for improvement, especially with regard to AirBART, and it would be just fabulous if BART would run until after 2:00 AM (i.e., after the bars close), hence only a four-star rating.Also, BART employees are usually reasonably polite and helpful, unlike their counterparts on Muni (see BART passenger description, above) or Caltrain, where the conductors would as soon push you under the train as have you ride it.  BART's Web site, especially for cell phone users, is far superior to any other Bay Area transit system's, with an accurate and intuitive trip planner.  BART has one of the best public transit ratings in the country, and it deserves it!"
638,4,"Oct 2, 2011","BART does a great job being what it is. There's absolutely no other decent public transportation line in California, and people who defund mental hospitals housing unfortunate schizophrenics like to howl and do the NIMBY thing because stuff like BART would bring ""those homeless people"" into their property value neighborhood.But gee-1. what's with the monorail thing? that's why it costs so much to build it right?2. the early closing hours are blatantly classist and creepy3. the prices - i've been around the world baby (neneh cheery) and I've never seen such an awful system subsidzing the rich while attacking the poor. what's the deal? why does riding the BART from Oakland cost decent hardworking people $200 + a month? it's really crazy. I lived in NYC for several years and even in that den of sin and spending there was a consistently affordable unlimited pass with 24 hour service for under $80 a month in my day. I think only London is more outrageously expensive, but larger world class cities like Paris were always providing decent unlimited passes at reasonable prices!Why does so much money keep getting poured into widening roads and a subsidizing lots of selfish people who throw a fit when there are carpool lanes? This is something that needs to be subsidized but I guess I can understand why people are leery of that due to the crazy amounts that get spent whenever there's a cool civic project in SF. There are people working 4 jobs and they have families where their partner is working too and they can't afford health insurance for their kids. I don't get why BART costs so much but freeways cost so little. I realize that there's subsidized pubilc transportation though so that is cool!Are the taxes really so high like I always hear people complaining? Are businesses really going out due to taxes or is that a lame excuse for crappy management or bad business decisions? Don't we have some of the lowest taxes in the industrialized world? Also, I don't understand this wimpy refusal to ride the BART. Oh wait, i do--OK, BART, I love you but what's with those cloth seats? They're intense! BART workers are cool though. And they finally got the clipper program through!I keep seeing so many excuses that ditch public transportation, with so little foresight or acknowledgement that the world's supply of petroleum is going to price skyrocket very soon. BART needs to be #1 or #2 on transportation funding priorities since it's a long term thing,r ight? Also, what's this childish stuff about BART ""not paying off."" Freeways are free and they ""don't pay off"". Oh man, BART, i love you but the persecution of bicycles has to stop. That's such a terribly policy. SF and Berkeley and Oakland are perfect to travel around in sans car with a bike. What's with this ridiculous no bikes on the train during rush hour stuff? I feel like it unfairly favors financial district workers, who are nice people but bicyclists typically require fewer buses and save us money more than walkers do. [copying the argument from he Caltrain bicyclist mafia)please stop attacking BART thoughtlessly. Note that there's a crucial lack of regional government in the SF Bay Area, with a lot of municipalities (enabled by car driving) wanting to have their cake and eat it too without throwing in their fair share of funding for all the wonderful things that being in a major city brings them."
639,1,"Sep 5, 2015",BART usually doesn't function when I need it. Today I needed to go to the city but of course the tracks are out of service to SF. Instead they offer us Muni busses with NO AIR CONDITIONING. It's so hot in this bus. You think that Bart would pony up some quality service for its riders given the prices we pay. What are we paying for? An outdated train that is barely comfortable? Major disappointment. This is America 2015.
640,4,"Jul 28, 2011","I've been using BART since the early 80s. And I must say that for a transit system, it is pretty darn good. It got me to various schools, to San Francisco, to both local airports, to work, to meet up with friends,... The seats are padded (and as my European sister-in-law mentioned, pretty wide to accompany fat, American asses).Things I won't miss:a.) People who pretend to sleep on BART so that they won't have to give up their seats for pregnant women or the elderly or disabledb.) The guy who brushed his teeth on BART and spit his wastes into a discarded Chronicle (back when newspapers used to litter the trains before everyone got smart phones)c.) The guy who was obviously jerking off under yet another Chronicle over his lapd.) The guys who used specific stops for their drug deals e.) The week-long BART strike that made me take 3 different AC Transit buses over 3 hours to get to workf.) That irritating BART driver who would pronounce Ashby as Sssssshhhhby."
641,4,"Jul 15, 2011","In the course of packing up for our move, we found about 30 BART tickets with various tiny amounts on them. We couldn't decide between donating them, or using them for last-minute errands. Since they added up to about $2, I decided to be selfish.The window is located at the spot that used to house all of the bike parking. The woman exchanged my ticket without question. Actually, the only question she had was if I had a nickel, as the total amount was $1.95. They only exchange tickets to the nearest dollar. There was a sign saying they only exchange tickets that were not purchased by credit card. I don't know how to tell how my tickets were purchased. She didn't say otherwise.Hours are very limited: Wednesdays from 10:00-01:30, and from 02:45 to 06:00."

643,4,"Nov 14, 2011","I'd doubt that BART is one the premier rapid transit systems in the world, but it does show the U.S. what a comprehensive transportation system can do to connect communities with the major metropolitan areas. Whenever I fly in to SFO and need to get into the city, you can bet you'll see me with my bag on the BART ready to get in the city in an efficient and reliable time frame. Running over 100 miles, it connects far flung areas of the bay area, from Berekley to SFO, Fremont to San Fran. It makes it easy to find a reliable way to get from one point to another. It's stations are clean and well organized, while the trains are comfortable with plush seating.The routes are priced depending on how far you are going on the system, however it offers a very good cost-effective option! Oh, when waiting for the train, be sure to wait behind the yellow line and the black marks note where the doors will match up!"
644,3,"Dec 6, 2012","I rode BART twice for the first time. Quick Impressions: Poor signage, but once you figure out the system, tickets etc this is a fairly small and simple train set up. The trains are noisy and old. There are no table or wifi---this is plain vanilla, mostly underground transportation. The stations are pretty dimly lit and it would have seemed BART could have thought of some public/private better space utilization for the stations. This felt like safe transportation and was a fraction of Cabs or rental cars."
645,3,"Jan 29, 2013","Convenient, quiet and fast mode of transportation around the bay area.B-rilliantA-ccessibleR-eliableT-imelyThe only downsides are that the trains are only semi-frequent and people don't let you get off the train before trying to bundle in.Then there's the stickiness on some trains due to incorrect use of carpet and same material on seats (nasty!) although newer trains have gone more plasticy which helps."
646,3,"Jan 23, 2013","BART is good. BART is bad.If you are not feeling like driving into the city, then it's nice to have BART as an option.It's reasonably priced and reasonably quick. It's also fairly frequent and usually on time which is nice.But there are downsides, sometimes the trains are sticky/humid when you get on which just feels nasty.Then some of the non-refurbished trains have the grossest looking stained material on the seats. Carpet on the floor inside? Whose idea was that?At least on the newer trains they use vinyl or some similar material (easier to spot nastiness) on the seats and floor which helps.This is a bit unrelated, as it's not BART's fault per se, but what gives with people trying to get on the train before riders have gotten off? I'm all for wanting to get a seat but let people off first?! Unfortunately this was not a 1 time experience and seems to happen much too frequently. Rant over.Averaging BART makes it ok, has good things, has bad things."

If you really want people to take public transit, make it easier and cheaper to use!"
651,2,"Jan 9, 2009","BART is a useful and fairly reliable form of local public transportation that could severely stand to be expanded and improved.My low rating is merely a reflection of it wasted potential.-Trains should certainly run later if not 24 hours. There will always be riders.-Coverage should loop within SF. Although a massive undertaking in infrastructure, connecting Castro/Haight/Sunset/Richmond/Russian Hill would supplement ridership substantially.And then there is that whole second guessing over whether or not you are going to get preemptively SHOT by BART Police. Apparently they don't need a reason, so if a man lying on the ground is a threat imagine what they think of you the rest of the time? Just standing on the platform, you start to look like Lee Harvey Wilkes-Boothe Hitler."
652,3,"Aug 1, 2013","I'm typing this review, as I am riding the BART into San Francisco. While I haven't used the service in months, I depended on it religiously my freshman year of college to bring home on weekends. Trains usually arrive every 15 minutes on weekdays and every 20 on weekends, which is fine (even though it doesn't quite reach Rio De Janeiro's one-bus-every-10-seconds). They try their best to clean their compartments, but most of the old seats are littered in stains and are breeding grounds for bacteria (Apparently, according to a NYT article, the seats are soiled in ""fecal and skin-borne bacteria."" Yuck.) Fortunately, these are being replaced by new, coated seats that are easier to wipe down. BART will also be replacing all compartments with next-generation ones soon, which I find exciting.Now, the bad: While I've usually been able to work in peace on the train -- it's not the NY subway -- you should expect your fair share of solicitations: Panhandlers making their way through the entire train, compartment by compartment, are not all that uncommon. Sometimes they'll stop in your compartment and start shouting at everyone. BART also closes at midnight every night, which is annoying. I understand that they need to close shop from 12-4 a.m. for maintenance, but couldn't they do this from 2 to 6 a.m. on weekends at least? I know that this is not BART's fault per se, but it's also frustrating that it takes 2 to 3 hours (sometimes more on weekends) by public transit to get from Berkeley to Palo Alto. Quick, someone build that Hyperloop."

It would also be nice if BART riders were more courteous.  There's no need to talk on your cell phone so loudly, or listen to music without headphones (or, for that matter, play it so loudly that people can hear it through your headphones).

658,2,"Feb 21, 2011","In summary, BART behaves like a smalltown rail, but it supposed to serve the Bay Area. It is nasty, it has very little coverage of the Bay and its operating hours are way too short. It needs to grow up.I don't even know where to start....Upholstered seats is plain gross, especially in a society with many people with no upbringing, who spit, pee and shit all over it.Coverage sucks. Having traveled to places like Tokyo or NY, there's no comparison. BART just has a stupid giant U route with like 4 variations. It doesn't even begin to cover the Bay Area. One route in SF is immature at best. It should branch off into at least 3 directions including a crosstown service. Now, you either go up or down! There's only one crossover point too from east bay to SF. Bootleg!East bay is the same, with only two branches heading north and two heading south, sharing the same route most of the time. Shit is ghetto.Uptime is stupid too. They stop running around midnight. This is an international city people, grow up!And stupid Sunday service starts at 8am. How lame is that? Try to catch an early morning flight at SFO with that bullshit! Who is them to decide that no one else in the bay need to do shit before 8?The management needs to take a field trip to NY or Tokyo or something to see how to set up and run a proper grown public transportation system."

Besides, they are by the door in the area designated to people who may need seating.   It's the personal, leashed dogs.  I am a paying customer just like the pet owner.  I am allergic to dogs. Since that one person started, there's the snowball effect.  There are, of course, those pet owners who are understanding and will move when I ask.  But, on the other hand, I've been met with more and more attitude when I let the person with the dog know that I'm allergic. ""Oh, I'm sorry - I do like to itch, sneeze, cough and scratch.  It builds character"". With my allergy - I guess I have to pop a few Zyrtec prior to boarding.My question is why must I be the one to make the compromise?I've spoken to station agents who can't do anything because of the unenforced regulation.  Some of them have allergies.  I was told to contact the Board of Directors.  I did.  They told me that although dogs are allowed, they have to be in a portable cage.  Purses, backpacks and bags are not acceptable.  Not on or off leashes.Someone told me that if the Board gets enough calls - it may make a difference.  CALL people CALL."

Every time I go to Walnut Creek I forget what line to take. You then have to jump on, and then scan the map. I know it's not the Dublin line.-going to the airport, you always have to wait for ages for the 1 in 3 trains going all the way. There's always collection of people with luggage at Balboa Park watching half empty trains going to Daly City."
664,1,"Jul 10, 2010","If I could give BART less then 1 STAR I would. I have since boycotted BART after the Johannes Mehserle verdict. My reason?1. Why does ANY transit agency (especially in a relatively safe area of the country) need to arm their ""police"" with lethal weaponry like GUNS!2. Why does ANY transit agency that gives tasers to their ""police"" not train their ""police"" for more then 6 hours on how to use non-lethal force.3. Why does a WHITE cop that kills an unarmed BLACK man only get Involuntary Manslaughter when the videos show he pulled his gun, aimed and executed someone with intent of malice. Sorry BART but I boycott you, urge others to do the same, and will vote AGAINST any future funding I have a say in, even if it destroys Caltrain or MUNI or other much needed transit agencies - beside, your system is 40 years old and has never upgraded."
665,5,"Feb 3, 2008","BART has its ups and downs. Its ups were in the 80's and early 90's, its downs are later 90's and today. Unfortunately, the price of tickets being higher, does not stop people I define as ""trash"" from boarding. People who have no real use for BART other then to sit, waste electricity, and put on a show for everyone else. Fortunately, I also have a sense of humor and find that fun to poke fun at. I can totally laugh about it, cause when I was 14, I used to take BART from ONE END to ANOTHER. I was so bored, I would wonder EVERY station AT LEAST ONCE in a week time, sometimes TWICE. Today, I take BART cause 8 minutes from Balboa Park to Powell is 45 to 60 on MUNI (yes, thats on the efficient J Train in traffic). I take BART cause I dont have time to waste to get home and try on all my new clothes I bought in downtown, which I DARE not try in a dressing room. Are you kidding? Have you seen the people in downtown that are lurking to rape you? HAH!My favorite part about BART, and I RARELY get to see this, cause I never pay the extra Trans-Bay Tube fare is enjoying the ""..included in the price..peepshow, Tunnel Of Love""! Most BART commuters pretend to not notice, but EVERYONE knows what the hell Im talking about. Its the people who get naked, who make out excessively, the people who give hand massages (with happy endings), and those who just get the quick ""SCREW"" on in that last car of the BART trains.....whilst it travels the 3.2 miles underwater in complete darkness outside, but bright florescent lighting in the cars. You think you cant see, and you dont want to see, but you cant help it, the reflection on the glass is blindingly clear!It really is cheap entertainment, but totally trashy. I think its cheaper then the peep shows in SF. The best trains to see this action.... Richmond to Daly City lines, generally at night, evenings. That my friends is why BART gets a 5 STAR RATING!"

My ears pick up the sound of *muah..  smoochy smoochy..* The smooches turn to loud sloppy kisses.Woman: OOooOH My my.. What a large pretzel you have there.. ** They didn't have any pretzels on them..

668,1,"Mar 29, 2009","I would strongly caution you to NOT park at long-term parking at any BART station. My car was recently stolen from their garage in Millbrae while I was out-of-town via SFO.Thinking I would save a couple of bucks, I used long-term parking at BART. Returning to the station 7 days after my departure, I found no car, thinking (hoping) I was jet lagged and absent-minded, I asked the station agent, who informed me after a couple of minutes on the phone with BART Police, with a grin that he could not hide, that my vehicle was reported stolen by BART 5 days after I had parked it at Millbrae!Takeaway Points:1.) Don't use long-term parking at BART. If you do, instead of posting your proof of payment on your car, instead post a sign that says, ""My car will be parked here for several days and nobody's really looking. Would you like to steal it?""2.) Pay a few bucks extra per day and park your car in a long-term lot for SFO that has intimidating-looking barbed-wire fences and an attendant whom a would-be thief would have to encounter.3.) Find the humor in life."
669,4,"Jun 6, 2010","Been using BART from the time I was in middle school - very convenient and environmentally-friendly alternative to driving. I appreciate this, as I try to avoid driving as much as I can. With a few exceptions, the trains have come in a frequent and timely manner and I've thankfully never been involved in a train having an accident. I'd normally love to give this business a 5, but cannot justify it based on the following:* restrooms need improvement in cleanliness* certain BART stations are not in very safe locations (e.g. West Oakland)* excursion fare is rather pricey (more than $4.00) - I think I understand that this allows a person to ""tour the system"" within 3 hours for a fairly cheap price, but what about the person who forgets something and needs to exit the same station within seconds/minutes of entering? Maybe there should be a timestamp, in that the excursion fare only applies after, say, 20 min but not before. I don't think it costs too much money/energy to process a single entry/exit, so it may be okay to not charge excursion for people needing to immediately exit. I just find it hard to justify excursion fare in this case, esp. as I've seen the overall BART prices going up."

Why is it that unless we go at some odd, off time that a person has no hope to EVER have a seat or even wiggle room!? Seriously BART, is it because you have a captive rider base? I have been taking this route for 2.5 years and it is rediculous! Does one need to move to one end of the line and work at the other to ever hope of getting a seat!? Why can't you run more or longer trains! I am sure you could run a computerized simulation to figure it out. NO EXCUSE. SOOOO FRUSTRATING!Trapped Consumer of Public Transportation"
671,4,"Nov 23, 2007","I like BART.  They give discounts if you buy in bulk ($4-$3 off for purchasing $60 or $45).  They give free rides.  They spare the air.  Carpetted floors and seats might be gross, but it's only for a short while.  It's nasty when people clip their nails, file their dead skin or groom but that's not BART's fault.  Funny coastal difference: NYers are nice b/c they wake you up if you're zonked out when the train pulls into grand central, but SFans are nice 'cause they let you sleep through your stop.  You see weird shit like the guy with a pet albino rat(!!).  But it's more peaceful than MUNI where loser boys are reciting ""this great [love] poem I wrote"" to a friend that we all have to painfully endure... Caltrain is neat, clean, snooty, and hella loud!  No wonder, the cars were made in Japan 1985; could use an upgrade.  Chances of delay seems less likely than BART but their stops w/in SF are inaccessible.Capitol Corridor is like an airplane on rails; even better actually.  But you'd only use them to get out of the BA. BART rocks.  So there you go.  4 for 1."

673,4,"Apr 22, 2006","EDIT: Recently I've embraced, new, brave Katie.  New Katie is hardly scared of BART at all (though she would like a cute boy to hold her hand while going through the Bay tunnel).  My only major complaint now is that the tunnel hurts my ears a lot.  I think I must have very sensitive ears because it doesn't seem to bother other people.   -------- The subway in NY doesn't bother me at all and the Metro in Paris is actually fun.  But something about the possibility of being stuck underground in the event of an earthquake has made me avoid BART at all costs.  Recently though, I had to fly out of SFO and the thought of paying for a cab superseded my fear of BART. I have to admit that it wasn't horrible.  It arrived on time and was fast enough.  But why do we need all the tunnels?  It was so loud in them that I could barely hear the person next to me.  Plus it's was more than unnerving to have the train make such a godawful noise while you can't see a damn thing outside of the car.  One good thing about all that was that by the time I got to the airport i was so excited to get off of BART that I hardly even cared about getting on the airplane (which seemed mighty safe, quiet, and comfortable in comparison)."

679,3,"Jan 24, 2012","BART = Overrated....Supposedly the BART is better than Los Angeles' public transportation system.For one thing. It is far easier to get your tickets in Los Angeles. The BART ticket machines are not very user friendly. Once you get the hang of them they are not so bad but still. In LA the ticket machines are far easier to use even when you are using them for the first time. Part of the reason it is difficult to use the BART machine is due to the fact you need to see how much it costs to get to your destination. After this you fiddle with buttons to tell the machine how much you have to pay. If you are a first timer you will take a great deal of time figuring out how to do this and it probably annoys the locals haha! I've seen bewildered people ask how to use these machines. I've seen bums help passengers out when they spot their bewildered faces.In LA you can get a day pass, a week pass or a monthly pass for most of Greater LA at the machines. I do not think you can get that from the BART machine. I'm pretty sure you can't. You need to get tickets or passes for the SF MUNI system elsewhere. As far as I know, you can get a pass for both BART and the MUNI but this is definitely not at the machines.I have heard people brag about how efficient BART is here in LA. I always believed them since I know how long you need to wait for buses in LA and since I know that some of the train runs are few and far between. When you think about it though LA is massive and the Frisco peninsula is narrow. Kind of hard to be inefficient there. Considering how massive LA is I actually have more respect for our public transportation system. i do have to give BART credit for their cushy seats though haha! They are far more comfy than the seats in LA!The worst thing about BART is that it is NOISY as heck during some parts of your journey. In any case, BART is good enough for me. However, it is a lesson in appreciating LA more. No, BART isn't better and the NYC subway isn't better either. On the BART we were talking about charming stories regarding the huge rats in the NYC subway system haha! My favorite NYC subway story is one about a bum that was sleeping on a passenger bench while these immense rats were nibbling at his feet. Priceless! LA is the place!!!!"

682,4,"Sep 4, 2009","Being someone from Boston, where the subway system is woefully inadequate, I must say that BART is one of my favorite transportation systems in the country.  The seats are cushiony, comfy (similar to the DC Metro), and provide ample room.  Plus you can catch the BART right in SFO (just like the tube at Heathrow).  But the big thing for me is the announcement system- there are screens that tell you *exactly* when the next few trains are coming.  You have no idea the public transport envy I feel when I come to the Bay Area or London and see that.  It screams efficient.Hence, I love the BART.  It is expensive, as other reviewers have pointed out, but it is a sweet ride."
683,4,"Jul 22, 2010","Dear BART, you talked to me today and had me all freaked out for a total of 2 minutes!  It's nifty that you've implemented an automated teller to repeat how much dinero one puts in the ticket machine, but it's also a bit scary.  I don't really understand the purpose, but this is me assuming that all deaf/mute/blind people don't benefit.  Anyhoo, although your trains don't come too often and you have YET to go to San Jose, you are the bomb for transporting my carless self from Berkeley to Fremont most weekends during college, and now from SF to Oakland/Fremont whenever I randomly need to go visit friends and family.  I don't really understand why you are ravaging Lake Elizabeth in order to make the extension to Warm Springs, but if you promise to have her back to her normal self by the time you're done with whatever it is you're doing, I'll forgive you for the inconvenience of having to walk around detours in my favorite place.  Thank you for all the good times, interesting characters and entertainment too.  If only you had cops that didn't shoot innocent people under the mistaken premise of grabbing tasers, I'd really really like you and maybe give you 4.5 stars.  Be careful about who you keep in your company because you eventually become them.  Peace."

The second reason is because the cost of driving downtown would cost me 2 craps and a whistle to park my ride.  Thank god I don't work in the FiDi anymore!Onward....The Good - Like I said, it got me from A to B.  The Bad - The trains smell like ass and they look just as bad.  It's in need of a serious overhaul and for the amount of $ that they pull in, they should be able to afford it.  Not only that, but any old stank-ass vagrants can ride it and you don't know if the person that was sitting in your seat before you is one of them!  Nasty stuff.  You have no idea WHAT was in that seat or what germs and nasty sh*t was left behind, unknown to the naked eye.  The Ugly - They should change the name to FART.  Because as far as I can tell, it has all the makings of a fart.  Sometimes it creeps up on you and sometimes it just blows right on by.  Either way, it just plain 'ol stinks."

That's over a 1/2 hour of work!), but here's a piece of a conversation I overheard between 2 BART employees a few days after the threatened ""we want more money"" strike:Employee 1: Man, I make more money in a week than any of my friends!  They're hella jealous!Employee 2: Me too, man!  I make more a week than my brother makes a month!

I sometimes worry about riding it after viewing several You tube videos of weirdos jacking off next to other passengers and others starting fights and harassing passengers. It's dirty and too many riders have zero respect for keeping it clean for all of us to enjoy. And the security and workers hardly ever enforce the rules or go after those who litter or the mental nut bags, instead they like to shoot youngsters and take the law into their own hands. Bart, I know I sometimes have to rely on you to get me into the city and to work, school, interviews etc..and although you're a bit cheaper than taking the Bay link Ferry, I think I'd rather pay more to feel more secure and know I'll be getting to my destination on time and in one piece.

I was only coming back to lower my rating...So, I have been riding BART for the last year just about everyday of the work week.  And until May it has been great.  I enjoyed getting on the train and heading out to my gig in Emeryville every morning.  Nice to have a 26 minute warm-up for work every morning, listening to the iPod, reading and trying to keep my bike out of everyones way.  I laughed as I saw gas prices rising, knowing that I drive now about 150 miles a month!  Ha! Gas means nothing to me sucka!No. TLR, Not so fast.....Yesterday marked the 4th major delay on BART in the last 30 days.  This time I was 50 minutes late.  Now, I leave a cushion... but holy crap!  That is just about an hour stuck in a tube?!  With little knowledge of when I would be let free.  We just had a rate increase too. What give BART?

Having said that there are some serious problems I find. 1) Expense: Why oh why do I have to pay $10 for a round trip to the city? Between gas & toll carpooling quickly makes more sense which makes Al Gore sad. 2) Downtown SF only!?!?!? Oh I dearly wish there was a line out to the Richmond. Someone told me that there is some earthquake safety problem but of that I'm not sure.  3) Wacky Bartcard: Almost all other public transportation systems in the world use a flat rate. A $1.50 to get into the system and free to get out. This can be quite a hassle if you have to get a bunch of people into the train since each of them needs their own damn card. When they are tourists in turns into a fiasco .... ok so you say that the further you go the more you should pay? Why, then, is the minimum charge $1.40? If I only travel one stop it should be proportionate as well ... where is my $.50 bart stop? 4) Bus transfers : Ok so this is arguably a fault of the bus systems but i'm going to complain here anyway. You leave a bart station, grab a handy bus transfer and viola you can get to the Richmond (after 45 minutes of battling traffic and 10 zillion stops). Then it's time to come back ... if you don't make sure to bring exact change with you watch out ... you are going to get some nasty stares. I really wish that all bay area public transportation systems used the same magnetic cards. Then transfers could be calculated automatically. 5) San Mateo and Santa Clara county voters : IDIOTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 6) Train notification signs : when they aren't blank or telling you about some stupid safety precaution or advertising they occasionally tell you when the next train is coming and how big it is. Why they can't simply have that up there and post permanent signs for the other BS is well beyond me."

Sure, there are things that can be improved upon, but most of the issues like crazies and unwanted smells are typical of public transportation anywhere. I love that you can get anywhere in the Bay Area on the train, and the ride is relatively painless, as anyone who's ever driven in this town will tell you. I'm always on time to work, and get to read and write and listen to music on the way. Score. The Verdict: It's public transportation. It's not perfect, and I of course, wish it were cheaper. But all the haters out there are a bunch of whiners. For real."
706,4,"Apr 18, 2007","One star is missing people, and I'm guessing you East Bay folks know what that represents; the thing SHUTS DOWN right when you need it! Too bad for you, little drunky that got kicked off the stoop while trying various deal-closing lines to be invited into your new friends bedroom. Now you've got to walk your ass to the Transbay bus and try to flag it down while its going like 65 in the middle of the night.    In the daytime though, its clean and on time which is a miracle to anyone who ever lived in NYC(not dissin my subway people-they're smart enough not to carpet the cars).   I was under the Transbay Tube (between Embarcadero station and West Oakland) when an earthquake hit and I didn't burn or drown, so BART rules!"
707,3,"Aug 14, 2008","BART is the easiest and best mass transit system to use to get all around the different parts of the Bay Area with perhaps Amtrak coming in a distant second.  I used BART for several years for my daily commute from the East Bay (San Leandro) to the Financial District (Montgomery St), which only took 30 minutes door-to-door (assuming there were no delays). And only costs $11 roundtrip (includes $1/day parking for Fremont station)Yes, I'm aware the system has its occasional hiccups and outages, but no system is perfect.  During my rides on BART, I can simply take a power-nap to refresh myself before I reach my destination (whether it's my office, car, or the Oakland Arena to watch a Warriors game - Yes, I'm aware that Baron Davis is now w/ the Clippers, but I was a loyal Warriors fan before he came to the Bay Area...they're still our local b-ball team...even if they do suck), read a book, do some work, or just catch up on my Wallstreet Journal or e-mails.  Today, I still can rely on BART to hope on the Fremont station, quickly coast down to downtown SF to do my holiday shopping without having to worry and fight against traffic or other people for parking.  The price of the tickets have increased and we now have to pay for parking, but I guess that's what's needed to keep this system going and improving.If/when they finally get rid of all the red tape and bureaucracy and extend BART down to San Jose and the rest of the South Bay, and effectively connect all three airports (SFO, Oakland, & San Jose Int'l), then I'll uprade my rating of the system to 5-stars."
708,4,"Aug 28, 2006","Ahhhh Bart...where do I even start. Well, first let me say I'm an extremely punctual person. I hate being late places. I usually strive to be places I need to be a half hour in advance. So obviously time is VERY important to me.The one thing that I really love about Bart is the time factor. You can pretty much rely on what the schedule clams will be the time Bart should be arriving next. I'm also an impatient person to some extent, so I like to have an idea of how long I have to wait. Bart seems to keep me posted pretty well. There are times where Bart can let me down, and that's the precise reason I didn't give it five stars. There are always improvements that can be made, but I'm satisfied thus far. Another thing to note about Bart is the convenience factor. I don't know how many times I've gone down into the station, and lone behold my Bart train is already there! I can clock getting downtown to about ten minuets or less... school about 20 minuets...now how awesome is that?  No matter how you look at it Bart is one of the better forms of mass transit around. Now I just wish boyfriends were as punctual as Bart..eh I won't hold my breath..."
709,5,"Dec 15, 2006","BART is like the greatest thing ever compared to most other US public transit systems (the one exception being Washington DC Metrorail).  I went to grad school in Boston, and holy shit, the Boston T is like an insult to humanity.  Here are BART's strengths and weaknesses in comparison to other major US transit systems (e.g., New York, Boston, etc):Pros:Fast (BART's *lowest* typical speed - 36 mph - is nearly as fast as the *fastest* speed of an NYC express train) +++Reliable (my experience is about 98% on time) +++Safe (0 fatal accidents in approximately 20 billion passenger miles) ++Cheap (people complain that it's more expensive than Boston, but per mile it's a lot cheaper) +Comfortable (rarely reaches true crush loads) +Clean Stations +Timed Transfers...OMG, these are the best things ever +Cons:Worse Coverage Area (but that's not really BART's fault - it's the geography of the area) --Infrequent Off-Peak Service -Trains Carpets Getting Funky -BART wins 12-4...that's enough for 5 stars in my book.Update - my favorite BART quote ever:""BART, which carries about 340,000 riders a day, meets schedule about 95 percent of the time. Management hopes to boost that to 96 percent.""Yeah, that's what we like to hear - a little bit of the Japanese railway timekeeping mentality going on there.  I hate it when a transit system lets itself slide.(from http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/06/13/MNGRUQEFN81.DTL&hw=bart+west+oakland+paramedic&sn=001≻=1000 )"

I've become too accustomed to getting myself around the Bay Area without a car, and I know the superior AC Transit Transbay and CalTrain services can't always take me to where I'm going, especially on weekends.That said, there are so many obvious ways BART could've been better from the start.  There are well-designed public transit  systems all over the world which the BART planners could have emulated...but did not.  For instance, none of the BART planners seemed to think providing express service was important.  Yes, every BART train stops. At. Every. Single. Station. On. The. Route.  The BART planners were clearly not contemplating taking that hour-plus ride from the East Bay to the Peninsula themselves!  No, indeed, spending all that time on a BART train is only for chumps.   If there are free seats, they might be too dirty to sit in.  If you're a bicyclist, other passengers might give you a hard time even if you're following BART's stringent rules about when and where you may place your bike.  If you're hungry or thirsty, forget it!  Put some calories in your mouth, and you could be cited by a BART cop.All these years of using BART have made me seriously consider getting a car."

Surely something can be done to correct that situation in the middle of summer.

716,3,"Nov 13, 2007","Traveling from the South Bay to the City...Commuting from San Jose to San Francisco five days a week is not for everyone.  It requires mad skill.  Different modes of transportation should be used on different days, depending on what you have going on in any given situation.  Picking one's mode of transportation from the South Bay to San Francisco is much like choosing which wine to have with your food.   It takes finesse.  Experience.  Taste.  Ones choices are:  1) Fremont BART; 2) Caltrain; or 3) Driving.If one chooses the mode of transportation wisely, one can make it from San Jose to the financial district in San Francisco in an effortless hour to hour and a half.  Effortless, because your time will be spent catching up on a favorite novel, reading the newspaper, or calling a friend you haven't spoken to in ages.if you do not choose wisely, you will be stranded in a quagmire of public transportation or gridlock hell.  There will be no parking spot at BART or Caltrain.  BART or Caltrain will be delayed.  You will miss the express service and it will take 2 hours to creep into the City.  And then, once you get to the City, MUNI will not show up.  Or, you will spend two hours in your car inching up the 101.So when should you take Fremont BART to the City?  In one, and only one situation.  When you are both leaving the South Bay and the City either extremely early or extremely late.  Mix and match as you please -- it will give you 4 combos (early-early; early-late; late-early; late-late).  But you can never, ever, plan on leaving either the South Bay or the City at a normal time.  This is very similar to the rule that you should not feed gremlins after midnight. You may take BART if you need to get into the City very early (leaving Fremont no later than 7am).  Why?  If you don't leave Fremont obscenely early, you will not find a parking spot at BART.  Or, leave Fremont late, by 10am -- more parking spots open at that time.  Conversely, leave the City early -- no later than 2pm.  If you leave between 3-7, you will be stranded on the parking lot, aka the 880 South.  Thus, BART is also a fine choice if you are having a late dinner in the City, and want to leave from 7 - 9 pm.BART gets three stars, because it is generally reliable.  Minus two stars for its significant limitations."
717,4,"Aug 5, 2008","Living in Orange County I can appreciate any form of public transportation that actually works.  I've only ever ridden the BART from Oakland Colesium to the 16th and Mission Station and back when visiting SF.  But each time I have gotten a train quickly, I've always gotten a seat, it has been relatively clean, and I go to where I wanted to go in a reasonable amount of time for a decent amount of money.The only problem I have is the lack of a decent audio system or a sign board announcing the next stop.  Not being familiar with SF and the BART stops I always make it a point to count the number of stops before getting on the train so I know when mine is approaching since I can't rely on being able to understand the garbled gibberish coming out of the crappy speakers."

If the train is full he will apologize for a ""sardine commute"" and let the passengers know if there is another SF train close behind us.  And arrived at 8:44 , seven min. Late.  I have been riding bart every weekday for about a year and a half now.  I normally take 2 or 3 trains earlier than I should need to in order to be at work on time.  Why?  Well, the answer is the reason for this review blog.  I would like to document the frequency and length of the  bart delays at least the ones I experience.  Please join me if you are as disappointed  and frustrated as I am.  To step on my soap box for a moment, I will say that it is not just the delays that are motivating this exercise.   I either can't hear what the driver/announcer is saying or I am getting my eardrum blasted!  The volume of the speakers is an issue.  About a third of time, and this is only based on my experience, so chime in if you disagree,  the train is a SAUNA!!  Especially when the train is sitting in the tube or some other place where the doors cannot be opened.  Back to the delays, medical emergencies cannot be helped for the most part,  but the reason for the holding of the train is what exactly?   Track maintenance during the commute hours??  The results of delays are not just the obvious issues with attendance wherever one is traveling, but also crowded trains.  When a train is delayed, more people get on at each proceeding stop.   Lack of personal space aside, tensions as well as temperatures rise.  It makes for a very stressful and potentially unsafe(?) start and or end to one's day.  Now I don't know if BART ever promised a pleasant ride, but somehow I would think that some basic safety questions would at least arise but hopefully be addressed.  How many people is safe to travel in each car?  Is it safe to hold trains at the end of Warriors games, or the last train of the night and send BART reps to the platforms to pack people like sardines (and I mean to the point of not being able to move any part of one's body) and send them on their way??  Is trained staff on board to address medical issues that arise from this stuff?  Yes the solutions to my concerns have a hefty price tag, but the price of not addressing them might just be greater.  I'm not just talking about personal comfort and individual passenger health, which sadly hasnt been enough to motivate a change, I'm talking about larger scale effects on the economy.  Where could we be if more people could just have a reliable and safe commute to work not to mention the rest of this beautiful Bay Area?  Ok, off the soapbox.  What are your thoughts?BART, my request to you,  since you increased our fares at least once since I became a rider promising improvements, please deliver.   It's great that threw are new cars and seat covers,  but what I care about is reliability.   Thank you.   Day one:  2/6/15 : took the Daly City train that should arrive at embarcadero at 8:44.  I am currently leaving as I type, West Oakland station and it is 8:50.    We arrived at embarcadero  at 8:57.  Now, on the ride home, we are holding as we are backed up behind a ""couple of trains""... at 5 :51"

Its fast as hell and gets you where you need to be without all that traffic mess. In fact I took BART to the Golden State Warriors game the other night  with my homeskillet and I was amazed at how quickly I got there! In addition to the great ride on the way home, BART offered a little ""contact high"" from some peeps on our train who clearly didn't mind the cameras and sparked a doobie in our car  while saying ""We from Richmond, we ain't corporate!""  NICE!!!!!! I love you BART!"
727,4,"Sep 2, 2007","Bart is awesome!, the ride is pretty smooth and convenient as well, the only downside is that there are stupid people who talk loud and are inconsiderate of others, and annoy everyone on the train with their stories on life that nobody really cares about.  The fare from fremont to sf is 10 dollars though, a bit high but better than driving through all that traffic, plus it's nice to get a little nap along the way :) save up energy to wait for your gf while she shops the day away in sf."

I can leave my car in Pleasanton and catch the train into the city for a week of being car-free.  I can go to Berkeley and catch the train to Oakland or to SF.  When I'm in the south bay I can park at Millbrae and go anywhere from there.  That's where the Cal Train station connects to BART too.  Although I don't mind driving 580 or 101, I don't want to drive in SF, so this is THE way to go."

And not to be able to get an all day pass for a set price...shame on you. Make yourself rider friendly. Yes many people use you for commuting and trips into the city for entertainment like concerts and dining, but miss the last train before midnight and you are screwed. It's so annoying getting out of the Warfield and making sure you get to BART before the last train. Or if you leave Oakland Coliseum and you need to transfer, do it early enough or you'll miss it! ugh! What's the point? You just might as well turn into a pumpkin.....The NYC subway isn't the cleanest and yeah it's pretty crowded at commute times but it's so easy to get around the city. And it's CHEAP! (and many times entertaining in it's self). The MAXX in Portland is CHEAP and gets you from Beaverton to Gresham through Portland, into the Airport (so easy!)

731,4,"Dec 24, 2009","While in SF I've taken the BART to get from SFO to a hotel in downtown and go to Oakland. For what it is, a commuter subway, I think it's the right pill for the area. Knowing that you use it to basically go to other cities around the Bay it's great. It would be nice if it was flat rate like NYC, Chicago, and LA subway and train systems, but you can't have everything. I found BART to be among the cleanest systems that I've rode and I felt quite safe riding to just about every station even after coming just after that BART cop shot/killed that guy in Oakland. I come away with a good regard for BART."

They should do more to integrate the different transit systems around the Bay Area so you can just use the same card (E.g. in NYC, the same farecard lets you on either the subway or the bus.).- The BART tickets are so easily demagnetized! If you put it too close to your ipod, the magnetic clasp on your purse, your building entry smart card -- anything will demagnetize it!  So annoying."

I don't even have to go outside!It cracks me up that the little schedule at the Millbrae Station has ""Union Square"" penciled in next to Powell Street, I guess a lot of people had questions on how to get to Union Square.Also, huge plus that BART can take me to Little Star in the Mission and eliminate the headache of parking.

738,3,"Apr 20, 2011","I've ridden public transit in Washington, DC, Boston, NYC, Philly, Houston, Amsterdam, Paris, Barcelona, and London.  How does the BART measure up?  Decently.  There will probably not be a service representative to answer any questions.  If there are, they will be deep in conversation and ignore you until you interrupt them.    There are kiosks with which you can use cash or credit/debit to purchase tickets.  You have to figure out your destination to figure out how much cash to put on the ticket.  There is no way to input how much to put on your card, just start with where the machine allows you and then you have to use the up/down arrows to add/subtract dollars and cents to your ticket.  Annoying.  You will have to swipe in at your entry point and exit point.  The platforms have electronic signs that do tell you when the next train is arriving, pretty accurately.  It's expensive compared to all of the other cities in which I've ridden public transportation.  In Boston, I can get from the airport to anywhere on the MBTA $2 ($1.75 with a Charlie Card).  A friend took the bus In Houston from the international airport to downtown for $1."

I hate how it gets super packed during rush hours (close to 9am and 6:30-7pm) though, but I deal with it since I'm on the train for less than 10 min anyways. It's totally worth it if you live in SF because $45 for a monthly MUNI fast pass will let you take BART unlimited within the city.The price can add up if you commute from the East Bay but I think BART is an excellent public transportation system! The gripes I have about the trains (esp the ones with carpet) is that it can get smelly/damp on rainy days and the seats can have questionable stains. At least it's not as rickety and noisy as the NYC subway.Overall, BART is awesome and I'm all about reducing my carbon footrprint!"

748,4,"Oct 1, 2010","Anything's better than SEPTA.I hardly ever took BART when I lived in California and would take it a few times while visiting and have never had a bad experience while riding.  Chances are when I find myself back in the Bay Area I will be using it quite frequently, unless of course, I buckle down and learn how to drive ;)"
751,2,"Jul 31, 2017","Good for those who work 9-5 and commute to/from the city because while the trains are full, at least the station agents will be present, and the riders will be quality people. If you work off-hours like I do, it's a different story. Riding during the day isn't too bad, except for the panhandlers (sometimes aggressive) walking the trains and the general semi-foul smell that BART always seems to have. If you're riding at night, however, you best be on your guard. In the past two weeks of riding (I come home from working weeknights close to midnight) I've seen: 1) a loud argument between two homeless people in the 12th street station result in one of them violently kicking the train 2) a fight on a train over a hat 3) a guy stripping naked in the Montgomery station 4) someone smoking crack on the train. This was pretty much the last straw for me, so I usually commute via car or the bus now. Basically, if you plan to ride after 9 PM, prepare for some crazy stuff to go down. Also, there's been at least two incidents where teenagers have stormed the train at Coliseum station looking to rob people, so keep that in mind as well."
752,3,"Dec 19, 2008","Please please please run more cars on Richmond lines! Transferring from a 10 car to a 3 car is insane. I wish BART ran later than 12:30am in order to avoid being stuck in the city. Riding BART on Sundays is the worst :( They could clean the cars more and do more upkeep on maintenance. I hate going into those warm, sweaty, and smelly cars! I am looking forward to the new BART."
753,3,"Feb 9, 2016","They desperately need to add more trains and cars on the Pittsburg/Bay point line. It took me to the 3rd train to finally board. In addition, it's wall to wall standing. Almost as bad as Asia."
754,3,"Nov 11, 2005","Sometimes I BART back over to the EB, sometimes I take AC Tranist.Ways BART is better that ACT: - quicker to where the Honey picks me up. - shorter walk to Bart form the office - you can buy BART tickets everywhere.- people can't use thier cell phones in the tunnel (yet...)BART sucks compared to ACT:- you feel dirty after taking BART - some of those cars are old.- just try getting a seat after 4:45pm.- annoying tourists take BART- It makes me lazy.- when it rains it gets really nasty humid in the cars."
755,3,"Jan 17, 2007","BART really should be rename to SFEBRT (SF-East Bay Rapid Transit) as it really doesn't service the the South Bay. BART really should focus on providing: [1] transit operation to three and 1/2 of the largest employment centers (SF, East Bay, San Jose, South Bay) [2] better transit connectivity with other public transit (bus, cabs, Amtrak, etc.) {the SF Transit Terminal being propose will solve this issue} [3] more mix-use developments around stations similar to ones found in Asia and [4] run several lines 24/7 especially on Friday & Saturday; its ridiculous that this metropolis doesn't run trains all night while Chicago and New York does.Beside those 4 solvable issues, BART is a great mass transit system. It's convenient, reliable, and cost effective to get around the SF-East Bay."
756,3,"Jul 15, 2007","First off, they have to regularly clean certain areas on BART trains that smell like urine.  I don't take showers in the morning just to undo it with a fresh scent of human pee on the way to school/work.BART is typically efficient with their times, but I'm not into the idea of charging 2 dollars a day at certain BART parking lots such as the one in Daly City.  Yeah, I know you can get a monthly pass but still, they already did with the hikes in prices.  What gives?"
757,3,"Aug 17, 2007","Okay, so I'm glad BART exists for when I don't feel like getting my butt numb from riding Caltrain to San Francisco. The ride is definitely much smoother, but that's all it has going for it.The ride is relatively expensive for the places you go to. The stations are inconvenient to get to and pretty spread out. The system closes at midnight for some reason, which doesn't make sense on the weekends. If you want people to stop driving while they're intoxicated, have the public transportation system (BART especially) open longer to accomodate the crowds during late-night weekends. DC's Metro system and NYC's subways already do, which is why those subways are definitely much better than BART.I can't wait for BART to get to the South Bay...whenever it does. At least then it will be a little more convenient to ride it instead of having to drive to Fremont. It kinda defeats the purpose of taking public transportation in my books."
758,3,"Sep 3, 2007","Close to on time, gets me to East Bay when I need to go, and certainly is moving in the right direction by removing the carpet in place of a much easier to clean, sanitary floor. I still think it's too expensive. I think it's shite that it closes at 12:30 on weekends. I know it's totally confusing for non-locals. BART still has a way to go..."
759,4,"Nov 1, 2007","Sometimes it smells, but it is mostly on time, and what is the alternative?One day I hope it will go all the way around the bay, is that asking too much?"
760,5,"Jan 9, 2008","It was hard...  4 or 5 stars...  It's safe, clean, lot's of buses stop there, plenty of parking and you're completely protected from Mother Nature while waiting for BART.  Excellent design.  But, with the additions of some places to eat close by, that pushed it over the top!  Now, there's a Starbucks close-by and some other places opening soon."
763,5,"Mar 13, 2008","BART is to MUNI what Bart is to HomerBart way fasterHomer way slowerBart smart, fun, a little bit massocisticHomer drunk, dangerous, and slightly retarded, but loveableBART is great, it goes under the bay in a earth quake prone area!"
764,4,"Jul 23, 2008","I admit, I was anti-public transportation for a LOOOOONG time.  HOWEVER, I am also fiercely anti-paying for parking.  This presents a dilemma, primarily on high-traffic weekends, such as the one prior to Christmas, and the recent 4th of July.  Instead of driving downtown, I decided to take BART, from Balboa Park, near my house.  Holy hell, it didn't take very long, wasn't a very long walk from my house, and didn't smell bad either.  Perhaps I'll be taking BART more often.  BART, you've restored my faith in Public Transit.  p.s.  You will still never see me on the Dirty Eight Geary, though, no way in hell.  *shudder*"
765,3,"Nov 1, 2008","A few things BART could do to be kick-ass:- Install that glass barrier thing like they have for the SFO AirTrain.  I was on the train when some dude leapt onto the tracks at Civic Center and held up the entire system for hours.  Thank god for Muni, but, having some sort of barrier between the passengers would keep bodies off the track, keep other sorts of debris off the track, and stop that wind tunnel effect when trains come roaring into the station (esp. at 24th and Mission)- Run earlier and have more frequent trains on the weekends.  Maybe it's just me and my early-bird ass, but it sucks having to wait until like 8:30 on a Sunday to catch the train down to Daly City.  At times I just took the J to Balboa Park and hopped on the 54 Felton bus to the Daly City Station instead of waiting for the station to open.  And I wasn't commuting to a weekend job either, but I know a lot of people do.  Having the option to take the train instead of the bus would be nice.- RUN LATER.  Remember when the trains ran all night that one time?  That was awesome.  Not only would I have to peace out of parties too early to make the last train, but it might help its budget problems if, you know, more people were riding the train.  I know I'm not the first person to suggest this, but they really need to consider it.  C'mon!All in all, it's doing a great job, but it could be excellent if it did these few things."
766,3,"Nov 7, 2008","I like how they announce which train is coming along with the estimated time of arrival (psst, take a note Caltrain!)I like how unlike the Caltrain doors between cars, the BART doors don't try to use you as a door stop.And I like how the majority of them are on time. Seriously, Caltrain, learn something!Things they can improve:Reupholster the seats. Do it. They're gross.Using something more than nothing to better sound-proof the cars. Because I've grown rather fond of hearing.Oh yeah, and unlike Caltrain, they can maintain over 60 miles of track."
767,4,"Jan 28, 2009","Pro's:*Very fast compared to Muni*Warm inside the trains*Comfy Seats (although I do suspect bed bugs in a few cars)*Accurate train arrival predictions*Escalators rarely down*Good for the environmentCon's*Expensive*LOUD in the trans-bay tunnel*Stations close when there are riots leaving you stranded in the. .well. .riot*No service to San Jose which really really really sucksI really endorse BART though and it is a LOT faster than driving over the bridge during rush hour traffic. I rarely have delays and since I am a reverse commute, I always get a seat."
768,3,"Mar 21, 2010","Now that I don't need to take BART to work, I have a better appreciation for it.Living in Oakland can sometimes put a damper in your social life, especially if all your friends are on the other side of the bay. But living 2 blocks away from a BART station changes that.On the weekends, I can walk to BART, and in 20 minutes be in the City. No traffic, no parking drama, no road rage.I know the daily drama of having to take BART to work makes most people hate it, but it's a great thing if you learn to appreciate it for what it is, rather than the crazy people who ride it."
769,1,"Sep 17, 2010","Granted, I'm the fool who tried to save a few bucks by flying into SFO instead of SJC. But $4 to travel from the airport to CalTrain (two stops, ladies and gentlemen) seems completely ridiculous. It was a mere $6 to get all the rest of the way to San Jose. Biggest annoyance: When paying with a credit card why is the default price $20? Seriously? Just ask people what they want to pay, rather than assuming the maximum then requiring the traveler to repeatedly press minus one, minus one, minus one until they get to their desired fare. Talk about a waste of time."
770,5,"Sep 24, 2015","For all its quirks, BART is a major asset to the SF Bay Area and a strong positive quality of life differentiator. I take it from the far suburbs to the City pretty much every day and to me that beats driving in our traffic jams in every way.  Of course, it helps that I live at the end of the line and can always get a good seat on my way to work so I can sleep or do something fun or productive.It is mostly functional as big delays are fairly rare (once or twice a month do I get hit by those). If one wants to live near a station, the choice of neighborhoods is great as the service area in the East Bay is large. The stations and trains are clean-ish and modern-ish (compared to Chicago or NYC). Clipper payment system is impeccable. Many stations do have large parking lots that always have room if you are there by 7:30. A lot of the tracks are elevated or at least are on the surface, affording a great view of the Bay Area. Most importantly, speed is unbeatable when roadways are congested.It is unfair to compare BART to transit in places like Northern Europe or East Asia. Sure, those are superior but for America, BART is just awesome. It is no secret that public transportation is just not a priority in this country so an apples to apples comparison is called for. In my experience, the only system in the US that compares to BART in both service area and cleanliness/modernity is the Washington Metro and even that comparison is a toss up. Folks like to bring up NYC as the ultimate transit success yet as functional as its subway is, a lot of it is unbelievably delapidated.I love my BART."
771,3,"Aug 15, 2006","-There needs to be more bart stations within the bay area. -Bart needs to be cleaned more regularly. (Hella Dirty)-There should be a flat fee for all day usage, instead of charging x amount from point A to point B, then point B to point C..etc-I agree with the reviewer who said Bart needs to implement a system like Fasttrack, it would make it easier for regular user to zip through.-What exactly do the bart booth people do? They get hella annoyed when you ask them a question. -Forget bart, make some bullet trains."
772,3,"Aug 24, 2006","BART, you scare the living daylights out of me.  Some of that fear is just random irrational claustrophobia, but I know it would be relieved a great deal if you would hurry up and do some earthquake retrofitting, especially for the tube and the tunnel between rockridge and orinda.On a lighter note, trains between 12AM and 5AM would be nice too.  Even just a few.These concerns aside, thanks BART for getting me to the city and to A's baseball games, both of which are a ninth circle of parking hell."
775,4,"Mar 23, 2007","In 8th grade I was dragged out of the city and moved to Castro Valley. I thought i'd show my parents some REAL independence by going back to SF as often as Tasha would have me.  how does a 13 year old get there?BART!!! unlike many of you spoiled brats, I LIKE the gross aspects of public transit. -the smell of urine is standard, at least it gets cleaned-no garbage cans on the platforms.... well yeah you're not supposed to eat or drink there anyway...therefore you shouldn't have any immediate needs for garbage cans-smelly perfumes and colognes on overly egotistical suits (in the AM) is MUCH more exciting than European lack of deodorant.overall, BART is great because: it gets me to and from work at a predictable time i don't have to park i sleep an extra half hour in both directions i occasionally meet really interesting/ crazy people and learn their life story while getting to practice my psychoanalytical skills and giving them advice  and lastly, i get to swing on the rails EVERY morning before work.on the down side, i wish there were more Dublin pleasanton trains and that it would be cheaper.... which is why the 4 stars."
776,3,"Jun 29, 2007","It pains me to only give 3 stars to a public transit system... but that just about embodies it.  Its old... doesn't run as often as one might think it should.. the cars are aging...Why don't people use BART more?  it is inflexible to the needs of the peole.  ....  now just cuz I bring up these issues, doesn't mean I know how to solve them... I'm no PhD in sociology or behavior science so I know what people want/need/act.  Bart is really hit or miss.  1)  When I was a kid... I would drive over to west embarcadero and bart into work at embarcadero center.  Great... took me within a block of where I needed to be, saved me $$ on parking and bridge fare.2)  Going to an A's game?  awesome.. there is stop right there.3)  I went up to a class in downtown oakland.. I parked at the Fremont  station and took BART all the up and back.But that's kinda it... I still have to drive on one side to get to a station.... and most of the time, one of the stations, either the head or tail end, are in areas that are kinda sketchy, and I don't REALLY wanna spend time there, and there aren't any convenient/safe connectors on the other side.BART isn't especially cost effective...  doesn't run frequently enough for me to say ""wow... that was convenient,""  as an overall trip, because I have to drive to one end, isn't especially fast.... it's a chore and an effort to use mass transit like this.It fits the uses of some people... while not others... bummer!!  why is it that in the bay area... we have like 40 different bus lines, and half a dozen rail lines for public transit!!!  is it because our public works and government is just all suck arse that they can't get people to decide on stuff?  sheesh...  no wonder everyone is buying a hybrid!!!"
777,2,"Jul 11, 2008","Good points:- You'll get there. Eventually.- Better than nothing. Usually.- Only delayed sometimes.- The newer refurbished cars are much more pleasant to ride in. (although they still have to do something about those nasty old seats)- Gets you to the airports. (tho' AirBART is still a freaking joke)- Newer stations are fairly nice and more-or-less modern.- Recently, they actually seem to have gotten half a clue about making real-time train arrival and system status information available via the web and mobile devices.Bad points:- Trains and various station technology stuck in 1983 (I'm surprised they don't still have ticket machines that use Nixie tubes for their displays)- Train cars are filthy more often than not. Newspapers strewn hither and yon, half-full soda cans rolling around, chicken bones tossed on the floor, sunflower seed shells everywhere.- Air conditioning never works. (or am I mistaken about the trains even HAVING air conditioning?)- Mumbling train operator announcements... ""NESTOPIZZMSHSHSDHFPIUTHHSUTD, CHNGREFREDASFARPRTGHDDGGGFHD ANNASFDGSHGHGFUEDF""- Expensive (and rising) relative to other transit systems in the US and abroad, while reliability and rider experience is generally much poorer and, aside from minor improvements like the refurbished car interiors, seems to be declining.- Many stations are in very poor repair. Ugly 1970s earthtone color schemes only seem to accentuate the 35 years of grime oozing all over everything. Restrooms, if they're in service, are reminiscent of the 3rd world.- Useless after midnight.- Appears to be managed by cranio-anally impacted morons.- Rider information, maps, announcements, not always clear, sometimes needlessly misleading or confusing. Only took them 35 years to finally acknowledge in their printed materials the presence of, and ability to transfer to, other transit systems such as MUNI, Caltrain, Amtrak, etc. - Continually commits clueless and inept media and public relations gaffes, only furthering the the impression that the system is run by overpaid and out-of-touch boobs.- Infighting and lack of cooperation with other transit agencies appears to have contributed further to the already overdue and overbudget TransLink card rollout.- Tickets that get demagnetized if you look at them the wrong way, causing riders delays exiting the station, and frustration trying to get replacements issued. (Oddly, I've never had a BART ticket get screwed up on me outside of the system, it only happens to me after I've ridden a train and then try to exit. It's not like the contents of my pockets are any different in one place or the other. How do I know it's not the new RFID readers for the EZRider cards in the turnstiles jacking the things up?)- The fact that it's the only viable option some people have for getting certain places in anything under half a day.- Probably other snide comments I haven't thought of yet..."
778,2,"Jul 30, 2008","I still don't understand why people don't understand that there is a line to get on the Bart train.How many times have you been the first one in the line to have someone just all of sudden appear and rush in ahead of you.HOW RUDEOr when you are trying to get off,well people who really don't care that you are trying to exit they just pretend like they don't see you and move right on in and try to get a seat.I always let people get off first,as well as many other polite people that I have seen that get on ahead of me.Look, Bart is a fast commute to the downtown area,but the amount of assholes seems to escalate daily.Especially the individuals that block people who are trying to run down the escalator to catch a train.Move over to the RIGHT.Forgive me if this doesn't make sense,I am tired and wish it was Friday.Unfinished review update.."
779,2,"Oct 23, 2007","Bart has a few positive things that some may like.Spare the air day,parking at particular stations,finding tickets people drop in a seat,not driving to work and the quicker commutes.Ok,at times the quickier commute can be at times very slow and painful.My negatives:1.Delays2.People who act like the train in front of them is the last one.They end up getting stuck in the doors with a bag dangling.Delay us,you WILL not.Everyone proceeds to frown at the person.3.People who tend to talk loud.I mean VERY loud.After a night of suffering from a sleep deprived state I was on BART at 5:30am  and proceeded to get comfy(not really,I did try)regardless.Next station 2 people get on and sit in front of me.Started talking really loud.Mind you it was like 5:30am.WTF,I was in shock and honestly people were looking at them like can you please shut up already.Simply amazing.I would talk about more,but I am sure you know about it if you have taken Bart.Not bad for a fast commute.Prices and passengers vary.."
780,4,"Aug 13, 2008","This last weekend was my first time on the BART from SFO, and I really couldn't have been more impressed at how easy it was to get to the city!  Trains depart every 15 min or so and the cost of a one way trip is $5.35.  I took the train to the Powell St station, which incredibly just happened to be located within 3 blocks of my hotel!  The BART is also a great way to get to the Oakland airport or Berkeley.  Just beware, depending on where you're going, you might have to take the muni or a bus as a connection, so in that sense the coverage is a bit limited.  All in all, the trains are clean and comfortable, a super nice ride no doubt!"
781,3,"Aug 21, 2008","I was really close to giving BART 2 starts, but I'll settle on 3.  BART is necessary in my life-I need it to get to work and to take me to Cal Football games...so in the fall I am pretty much on it six days a week, twice a day.  However, just because I frequent BART does not mean I don't notice it's faults.  It's smelly.  Sometimes really, really smelly.  The seats are seriously FILTHY.  The paper tickets get demagnetized really easily (I am looking forward to the BART EZ Rider ticket I just ordered).  It is incredibly loud going from SF to Oakland.  Like, ipod on full blast and I still can't tell what I'm listening to!  Can't they do something about that??  It gets so painfully crowded at rush hour, they can't add a few more trains?  I could go on.  Pretty much, I only take BART out of necessity and the fact that I would feel guilty driving to work everyday.  I think it would do the BART system a lot of good to give it a little facelift, a little cleaning up."
782,4,"Aug 24, 2008","You know what, I don't live in San Francisco. I was only there to visit friends in SF and Berkeley, and to attend Outside Lands Music Festival. I can see that there are problems with BART (the ride from SF to Berkeley is so damn LOUD).Why am I giving it 4 stars? I was only in town for a few days, and I already pretty much understood the system and where to make transfers. The fact that it's on time, too, is rad."
783,4,"Nov 11, 2008","Things that DON'T suck:I've been riding BART for 10 years now, first as a college student, now as a person going to work. BART is pretty good, its on time about 99%. I have the credit card pass, very easy and you don't have to worry about it getting stuck inside the machine.  I find most station to have friendly people in the booths.  And, becoming less susceptible to colds.Things that DO suck:As of late, rush hours have been hard - I'm sure from gas prices/economy woes.  There's always a funky smell so maybe one day they will remove those seat covers.  And BART police don't patrol the cars as much as they should - too many wackjobs that smell like pee talking out loud to Jesus or something."
784,3,"Feb 2, 2009","So... it's better than having no public transportation around the bay area and it is definitely better than the muni...but that's not really saying much. Whoever thought it was a good idea to use fabric seats? Everytime I sit down, I think about the possible other people who have sat there after doing whatever it is that they do and i think that it's seeping into my clothes and skin....disgusting ... and unlike stainless steel or other kinds of metal, fabric can actually hold moisture and harbor bacteria... has the public health department been notified? i think it'd be interesting to see how much bacteria, fungi, and other stuff they can find on the bart seats. Why aren't the stations cleaner? Bathrooms?It's not like it already doesn't cost a ton of money for all of the bay area to ride bart. You'd think they'd have a little bit of surplus to do some remodeling or AT LEAST cleaning of the stations and bathrooms. Other things BART should do:-make changes to make it less noisy-make some sort of card/device to which you can add money OR a one time fee for monthly use. -run later (although multiple drunk people put together on a train doesn't seem to be the best idea at time, in addition to the fabric seats, which would probably now also contain vomit)-more security-workers with less attitudeother than that, bart is ok...but then again, that is almost like changing everything but the logo."
785,4,"May 9, 2009","BART is one of the better public transportation system in the Bay Area. It's fast, usually very prompt, and very predictable (they have a ""rotation"" system in place where if a Richmond train is here, you know what train is next). I usually take BART to and from downtown. Too bad it's not more extensive in the city, or else I would take it more often. The stations and trains are relatively clean, and the seats are mostly comfortable. But because the seats are clothed and cushioned, it does (and could) seem somewhat dirty. If the seats were metal, it would be easier to maintain, but of course it will not be as comfortable.For my usual BART route, BART does a nice job and I recommend it."
788,3,"Nov 30, 2009","Not a perfect system but alot better than HAVING to drive if one doesn't really want to.There, however, should be at least hourly trains for the late-nights instead of having to decide to take the last train  ( around 12:30AM'ish )  or wait till morning and take the first train the next day.Mostly on-time though a little cleaner carpet and seating would be nice  ( at least it's plusher than plastic )."
789,3,"May 3, 2010","After living in Bay area for several years, I finally did my first BART ride!  The ride was great, and impressed with their frequent trains!

790,4,"Aug 17, 2012",BART gets 6 starts for customer service.  We bought round trip tickets for two but put them all on one ticket - oops - and the guy in the booth was SUPER helpful and friendly and fixed us up with a new ticket and gave us advice about where to go downtown.  We thought this niceness was a fluke until the guy on the other end (we needed to talk to him to use our new hand written ticket) on the way back out of the city was super friendly also.  BART gets knocked down a star because those cloth seats on the train are GROSS.  I don't know who has sat in them.  They are filthy.  I would prefer a hard plastic seat that is wiped down once in a while.
791,2,"Nov 3, 2016","BART exists - that's about it!  It must rank as the most inefficient metro rail system in any developed nation.  There seems to be no reason that doesn't end up delaying BART trains.  ""Equipment problem"", ""Police activity"", ""switching problem""... you name it... even ""weather conditions"" cause delays of 10, 15, 20 minutes!!  What BS!  Traveling opposite to the rush commute, the trains are already 15 to 20 minutes apart!  BART is not cheap either!  Having lived in cities around the world with highly efficient public transportation systems, I've been trying to take BART as much as I can, to support public transportation, but, after 3 years I'm about to give up on BART!"
792,2,"Mar 28, 2006","My first problem with bart is those nasty upholstered seats. OK, maybe plastic is uncomfortable, but those things reek of mold and are undoubtedly holding cells for lice, spores and other nasty sh*t. When do you think the last time those were cleaned was? Yeah, try never. And the noise. The shrieking, terrible noise. If you plan on zoning out and relaxing on your trip, think again. Think about nails on a chalkboard. Lots and lots of nails. Has anyone every heard of WD-40?The metallic voice doing the announcements freaks me out and makes me feel like I'm in a sci fi book where the future is bleak and soul-crushing. Did I miss anything? Yes, it is as confusing as f*ck."
793,3,"Oct 9, 2006","Things that suck about BART:They're very careful to make it impossible to see the signs saying when the next train will arrive until AFTER you've swiped your ticket.  Meaning, you're on the hook for $3+ if you decide you could get there faster via some other means.You can't take a bunch of old tickets, stick them in a ticket dispenser machine, and have it spit out a ticket for the combined amount.  Nor can you use old tickets to add value to a new one.  No, to get value out of old tickets, you have to visit BART's service counter at select locations (e.g., Powell St. station) at hours of their convenience.It's loud.  So loud that you can't even listen to an iPod on the thing, without cranking it up to damaging levels.  BART's howl is anything but relaxing.On the plus side, it finally goes to both airports!"
794,3,"Jul 26, 2007","I use BART once in awhile, to go to San Francisco or the A's games or to SFO airport, which I find really convenient. However, I am not a big fan of BART for several reasons. One is the fact that the trains are so crowded during rush hours or during an event like a ballgame. There are not enough handrails to hold onto, especially if you are short like me.I once rode to SF during December when one of the routes was closed down. The train kept stopping and loading on passengers until I couldn't even raise my arms because we were packed so tightly. Whenever the train started or stopped everybody tried to stay upright, which was not easy if you had nothing to hold onto.I recently traveled to Scotland, where I rode trains and buses for two weeks. Although some of the older city buses were a bit dingy looking, I would say in general their public transportation system is much cleaner and comfortable than BART. They also allow food on the trains, and even sell food and drinks in most of the larger stations. When we returned home from Scotland I noticed how dirty and worn BART looked in comparison with Scottish trains.Another annoying fact about BART is the unavailability of restrooms at most of its stations. When the stations were first built, they had one single restroom for men and women, which was inadequate to serve the quantity of riders on busy routes. Since then the restrooms have been closed (I just checked BART's website and it states that the street level restrooms are open but those underground are closed). In the UK train and bus stations have restrooms with several stalls, all open when we were last there in May 2007. You sometimes have to pay (currently 20 pence) to use them at larger stations such as Glasgow and Edinburgh, but at least they are there when you need them."
795,4,"Sep 3, 2007","I will never understand why people who board the BART trains in the downtown SF area after 5pm on weekdays insist on forming lines to get on the train. First of all, the lines generally block the passageway for people trying to get off the trains which kind of defeats the purpose of having a line in the first place. Second, people like me just step to the side, wait for the people to come off the train and still manage to board the train before the people who insisted on forming a line get on. Organized chaos perhaps?In New York, there are no lines when it comes to the subway system. Either you push your way to make the train or you get stuck having to wait for the next one. Granted this isn't New York and I haven't had to experience any ""pushy"" BART riders, but people come on. Forming a single-file line is so grade school. Thank god for my monthly MUNI fast pass that allows me to afford to ride BART at all in the San Francisco area. BART is a bit pricey.Recommendation: Feel the seat first before sitting on it. Nothing says a shitty day then sitting on a damp BART seat. Especially if it is the first thing in the morning, on your way to work"
796,3,"Aug 20, 2008","WOW... I haven't taken BART in a couple of years, but yesterday I took BART from millbrae to powell and it is seriously the loudest public transportation system I have ever been on! I couldn't even listen to my ipod because it was so damn loud!The seats are pretty dirty too... YUCK! But other than that, BART isn't that bad... I still think I'd rather drive..."
797,2,"Jan 9, 2009","I have only rode a bart train one time, but I know some things becuase I've been working inside the Bart system for a contractor. My ride went easy and smooth! Bart is the prime exsample of a union wizzing money away. The reason they can't run trains at night is the fact that the train operators make more on overtime pay than the revenue will support. I am a union worker as well, and work very hard for my employer. Without my employer I have no job. So why would I milk it dry? Bart workers are a very strong union, with very weak abilities to produce what they are paid. They wizz money away left and right paying higher ranked officials to take a week worth of paperwork just to decide if the Snickers wrapper on the ground is safe to pick up.  Union YesBart Union NO"
800,4,"Jun 9, 2009","I have a true love//hate relationship with BART.  I love the convenience, you want to go to the city and get your drank on and need a designated driver?  This is your man.  You need to bypass weekend traffic for an apt in the city?  This is your man.  You need a girls night out and want to laugh and clown?  This is your man.But this is not your man if you want an inexpensive way to the city or you want to sit in a pleasant smelling environment.  Also would be great if BART was available on weekends at least until 2 am or so.Oh and don't ride on major holidays especially New Years Eve cause you're life will be at risk!"
801,4,"Aug 31, 2009","BART has been around a long time & I remember riding it all over the Bay Area when I last lived up here. It still is an excellent, smooth-running operation although I will now offer a few friendly suggestions to make it better. But I am REALISTIC also and know that BART is a public agency and what with the economic tumult at hand-my words of wisdom will probably fall on deaf ears. So be it!Coming into SFO and dragging a laptop, backpack and suitcase full of clothing, I am heartened to see that there is now an airport BART stop and make a run for it with all my stuff. But first you have to get on an Air Bus-just like at Disneyland-that takes you to the actual BART stop. Once there-it's time to buy a ticket in the BART machine. Get in line. Hope you have the ride amount of money and change cause I didn't see any change machines. Finally-with ticket in hand, I knew I had to go to Daly City, but trains would come and they wouldn't be announced-just roll in and you would have to ask someone or try to see the front where the place they go is posted. Get to where I am going and fading in the heat fast! Know I have to transfer to a Muni bus & ask the BART attendant at the station about transfers or where to get change. I must have interrupted her important phone call and this devoted public servantsnarled a reply to me that I can go buy a hot dog if I need change? I apologized and thanked her for the information.Bought a hot dog as directed by the personable BART employee who looked like BART just hired her off the crack addict welfare rolls over in Oakland. As soon as I drag myself over to the bus stop-the bus pulls away  from me just as I arrive and I am left to rest on the bench amid the flying in the wind trash and San Francisco vagrants. But finally I have a cool place to sit and ponder BART! The trains are amazing technical creatures run with the efficiency to rival the trains in Switzerland and Germany-like clock-work! IT IS IN THE FALLIABLE HUM AN  ENDEAVOR that BART falls short. Not enough sensible ticket machines. Not enough change machines. No attendants to stand watch and answer questions. No human beings sitting in the little offices there that are CARING & WANT TO HELP! Everything seems to be a hassle & am imposition to them. Hell-if I was lucky enough to have a cushy, public job that I sat in a booth all day answering questions-I would think I'd died & gone to heaven!BART: 3 words: CUSTOMER SERVICE TRAINING!BART: 3 words:  DIVERSITY AWARENESS TRAINING!BART: 4 words:  SERVICE WITH a SMILE!BART: HIRE YOURSELF SOME FRIENDLY FOLKS TO REP YOU TO THE PUBLIC; those surly ones belong back at the welfare office!"
802,4,"Sep 13, 2009",I like bart.lower prices and service more areas.. and you'll get more people  and quit chargin to park our cars too.
803,4,"May 4, 2010","Dear BART,You are a great alternative to driving and to paying huge parking costs (or parking ticket costs). Your trains come on time and your service is generally reliable. Your ticket prices are about what residents of other U.S. cities pay for their transit systems. I love the EZ Rider pass (similar to FasTrack) and the electronic parking authorization. Hope you soon create an electronic version of the senior ticket (since I turn 65 next year).One question, if you don't mind...Why is it that your elevators are so often out of service? I have never seen this anywhere else. For example, the busiest skyscrapers whose elevators are in constant use, don't seem to have the problems you do. What's up with that? Having had a recent knee replacement, I (along with many others) can't do the stairs. Many stations have no street level escalators, so when the elevator's out, I'm really stuck. Please, can you get reliable elevators? Thank you."
804,3,"Jun 7, 2012","I wish I could smoosh all the best parts of every public transit system together and leave out the crummy stuff. Here's how BART stacks up:Bike-friendliness: 5 stars (a model for other cities' less than half-assed attempts)Frequency of trains: 4 stars (except on weekends when you best not be in a hurry)Disability access: 3 stars (please speak UP when you make announcements conductor!)Service to airport: 2 stars (be prepared to haggle your cab fare if going early on a Sunday or if your plane arrives late at night)Affordability: 1 star (fine for tourists, but a pain in the pocket if you commute in the Bay)Police shooting and killing passengers when they can't afford to pay: minus 10 zillion stars (RIP Oscar Grant, Feb 27, 1986 - Jan 1, 2009)"
805,1,"Jan 16, 2018","01-13-18 Pleasanton to San Francisco, and 01-15-18 San Francisco to Pleasanton.  We were staying a couple of nights in the city and had heavy luggage to deal with.  On our trip into the city the escalators all worked and we avoided any panhandlers and rude riders on the train.  We did have problems with my wife's ticket that was just purchased in Pleasanton, working in the Pleasanton and San Francisco terminals.  On our trip from the city back to Pleasanton it was ridiculous.  Several escalators were not working at Powell Street Station making it difficult to carry our one heavy roller bag to the train platform.  We dealt with two idiots that boarded somewhere in Oakland who ran into the car pointing their fingers at riders making shooting sounds. Then they had to sit in my car of all cars and talk ghetto crap to one another while listening to loud gangster rap littered with ""F"" bombs.  We were also accosted by an African American pan handler begging for money walking from car to car as the train was moving. It seems the criminals and thugs make the rules on BART and run the show.  There was no police presence or BART employee presence to deal with the idiots. Ride BART at your OWN RISK!"
806,1,"Jun 4, 2017","bart is full of crap. first of all why is there test for a simple job like,,, cleaning the cars ets,,, , like you gotta be fresh out of high school or a rocket sciencetist, just to scrape of some damn gum, and clean up waste like liquids,  throw up and shit, then on top of that talking about all that overtime mess was used for extra gum on the floors and trains, and other things etc,etc.i still see gum that looks like its been there for months, and the pittsburgh platform looks like it ain't been washed off or steam cleaned for who know how long. then got the nerve to charge people all this money.   wooooow.  im done"
807,2,"Apr 7, 2015",I looked at the round trip fare from Dublin to the Colusiem and paid $7.60.  When I arrived to the airport my ticket needed moe money.....$19.60......
808,2,"Dec 15, 2014","The system used for advisories is ridiculous and unhelpful. The fact that my train can be 13 minutes behind with absolutely nothing written online blows my mind! This is relatively common, late trains with no advisories. The problem is you have no one to hold you accountable, people will continue to use BART because we have no choice, but just because you have a monopoly doesn't mean you get to fail does it?! We depend on you. You throw strikes to get what you want and then we still get left with poor service and a shortened time card. Not cool, not cool."
809,4,"Sep 2, 2007",So I'm not sure that carpeting/fabricing the whole car was a good idea....but the trains in Chicago are just as dirty and not nearly as quiet or reliable.   Not to mention we enjoyed a free ride on a spare the air day.  Left us with a fuzzy feeling. *minus 1 for the lack of audible annoucements.  sheesh.
812,4,"Oct 5, 2007","I find riding a BART train far superior to riding a Muni bus or underground train. It is also a lot faster taking BART in city than muni. They have AC and have padded seats unless there is a gnarly stain on the seat. The sweetest thing about riding BART Is going to the airport you get an awesome view of the planes getting ready to take off. The main gripes are it can be very loud especially when you go underwater on the transbay tube and some times it can be late but not as late as some of the muni buses i have waited for. BART needs to go farther maybe down to San Jose and up to Sausalito, if  they can create a tunnel under the bay bridge, they should have created one under the golden gate as well."
813,3,"Jan 29, 2008","I've been riding BART since it came on line in 1972.  FIrst it was from Oakland to San Francisco, then Millbrae to Oakland and now, Millbrae to Embarcadero.For the past year and a half, I take BART only if I absolutely must.  I'd much rather take the SamTrans MX into the City because there are less people, they're usually the same people and the germ quotient is reduced by a huge factor.The aroma factor is also much better on the MX.  BART train aroma is not so good.  Mostly smells like pee and sweat, especially if you sit on either end of each car.  Then there's the sick people...hacking, coughing, sneezing, wheezing.  Stay home people, don't infect the rest of the population with your sickness!This morning, there was debris on the track at the 24th Street station, then a woman fainted in our car between Civic Center and Montgomery.  The car was so packed, whatever was wrong couldn't be communicated until we hit Powell Street.  Then, she exited Montgomery, or was assisted, couldn't tell.Was grateful to finally get to Embarcadero and shuffle on to work."
814,4,"Jan 26, 2009","Convenience, reliable, cleanliness for the most part, and where I can peacefully listen to my iPod.  That's what sums up my experience with the SF Bay's transit system.  It's there when I have when I go to work, the Warriors game, and  various parts of the bay area.  Its the solution when you dont feel like driving and dont want to be stuck with the rest of the commuters on the freeway.  Only if BART would: 1: Have a flat fee to every station ($2.00 one way like NYC's subway)2. Expand to the south bay and north bay(north seems more of a reach but still.....) so it can truly be called the Bay Area Rapid Transit. 3. Have more stations in the city.....but the always ""reliable"" MUNI takes care of that.4. 24 hour servicethen I could use it even more than I am now.  Nevertheless, a great transit system in which I can depend on"
815,3,"May 31, 2009","On one hand, we're lucky at least to have BART. My friends from L.A. and other places wish they had an alternative to driving (a real alternative, not buses that get stuck in the same traffic.)But it's hard to give them more than 3 stars when you have trains that only run every 15-20 minutes, puke-covered seats and carpets, and endless incidents because it's such a dumping ground for unmedicated crazy homeless people. And a lot of this crap wouldn't happen if BART really served the public instead of existing mainly to funnel over-inflated salaries to its executives' pockets.Some day, there will be an intervention."
816,3,"Sep 9, 2011","Pros:- It isn't Muni- Usually not too packed- Tends to keep good time, mainly since it doesn't have to deal with street trafficCons:- Old look/feel- Doesn't run often enough on weekends"
817,2,"Oct 29, 2014","Bart is very convenient, overpriced compared to other cities with better public transportation, and VERY NOISY especially in the tunnels. The worst part, though is how filthy some of the stations are. The Powell Street station, for example, absolutely reeks with urine smells, and looks like it hasn't seen a mop in years. I understand that there is some construction going on, but that is no excuse for the complete lack of maintenance. Clean it up, BART!"
818,1,"May 7, 2015","If you want to know how messed up BART's priority is, then read this.There has never been enough parking spots in the Dublin/Pleasanton station.  If you don't get there by 7:15am, then you're sunk.  Parking fee went up drastically from $1 to $3 and it didn't help.  Long wait time to get into the monthly restricted parking.For quite sometime, folks can park at nearby station, West Dublin/Pleasanton and use the Stoneridge mall parking lot and Toys 'R Us parking lot as unofficial overflow parking.  We all know that's not legit but what are the alternatives?  I wish they smarten up and let us pay for parking there.  After all, Stoneridge mall has plenty of parking near the station.If BART is a customer oriented organization, that's what they'd do.  A lot of people don't have a choice.  BART is the only public transport to get to the city and they have to drive to go to BART.  Instead of helping them, BART decided to work with Stoneridge mall to close off the parking spots nearby West Dublin/Pleasanton stations.  Those spots just sit there, empty, while commuters are reeling from finding parking, knowing they're running later and later for their work.BART can't be fixed without outside intervention.  The contempt towards its riders is palpable.   I'm actively looking for ways to cut my dependency on BART.  I suggest y'all do the same."
819,3,"Sep 11, 2005","BART gets me from Berkeley to a few worthwhile places in Oakland or San Francisco. It takes twice as long as driving, costs marginally more than gas these days, and doesn't pass through many neighboroods, but it does save me the trouble of trying to park in the city. I wish it were less expensive, but they're just trying to pay operating costs. To lower rates they'd have to raise local taxes or fees on something else. Maybe a special $1000 flat tax on people who own H2s..."
820,4,"Nov 13, 2007","$5.15 to get from the airport to Market Street??  That would have normally been worth 5 stars in my book, but the train is a little noisy....the whine from outside when the train starts cruising fast was quite annoying.Fast and cheap...can't beat that!"
821,4,"May 19, 2008","I ride BART a lot to get up to the Downtown or around Mission.  It's pretty efficient and there's not a huge crowd in it all the time like in NYC.  I don't mind riding it and there's always fun people to watch while you're riding.  I love the scenery out the windows going northbound after Daly City, It's really nice.However, You always have those delays right when everybody needs them.  I missed my connection from BART to Caltrain in Milbrae last time because BART was 20 minutes late.  Everybody was on the platform for an hour waiting for the next train to come through."
824,3,"Jun 11, 2012","OK!! So travelling in BART was a pleasure ..till about a month ago.. now, not so much.The frequency is good, stations are good, The trains are fast and there are lots of stations .. excellent.But the traffic is increasing every day, and it is getting more and more crowded. It is not BART's fault, but it would really help if the number of trains are increased for the morning and evening commute.Lately there have been delays everyday, which may be longer than 10-15 minutes. This is very irritating. Most of the times the driver does not even bother to inform us the reasons for the delay.People have to stand for 40 min and the crowd just gets bigger and more angry.  All this gets really frustrating because the cost of commute is exorbitant.All of us also received an email saying that it is going to increase further, dint we ? The cost will be justified if the expected standards for service are met.BART is an excellent service/initiative, but it is time for them to re-evaluate themselves now and make some serious changes."
825,3,"Nov 26, 2017","BART, is now not cheaper than driving to San Francisco.  I've travelled many times through the years, but, Friday, Nov 25th, 2017 was the scariest, dirtiest, and most expensive.  I can't believe how dirty the Sears are, the backs of the seats, the walls, the windows. You could hardly see outside.  It actually cost us more in money and time than driving. But, the threat of the ad and bodily harm was the last straw. We stopped on the way back from San Francisco at the Bayfair Station, and were waiting for a Dublin train, when 8 Teenagers started harassing the few people waiting.  They were loud, jumping through the seat dividers next to us, they were looking us over.  We did see Security waiting to unlock the train doors when we got on, but no one later at the Stations.There should have Security at ever Station, and riding & walking through the trains.  We had to add money to our ticket at Lake Merritt, and there was a guy yelling, and screaming and waving his arms around in a rage.  We quickly moved to the other side.Also, what happened to the change machines?  So many people were looking for them!BART is really neglecting the maintenance and safety of riders.Something must be done.We all know they make millions and are building new Stations, but, they still should be forced to maintain the old ones!  Lastly, bathrooms!!!! Why aren't they open? There should be janitors and Security.  They need to be open!!!I don't know what hell people do when trains are delayed?!!"
826,3,"Aug 20, 2005","Ok Good and Bad are equal on BART.Good: It IS clean, efficient, and plain handy when needed. If i need to get to berkley, it can get me there in less than 30 minutes from downtown san francisco. Nothing else can really do that. It also is great for getting to the airport, it is still cheaper than taking an airport shuttle. I can take a cab to the bart station and the bart to the airport and it's still cheaper.Bad: Expensive, moreso than other cities, expecially when you go further than like 5 stops. Also it doesn't really go many important places, usually i have to go to a stop and get a car ride from a friend from that stop to where i am going. I live by fishermans warf, and i get off the BART and have to pay again to get on the MUNI. They should be connected so i don't have to pay more. Also there is no monthly pass for BART. It also is loud and you loose cell phone reception every 2 seconds, which sucks when you have to call the person to pick you up at the stop you are arriving at, but that's not completely their fault, but it's still going into the score above.In all, BART is still the cheapest way to get out of town, the bay bridge costs more than BART most of the time, let alone the cost of buying a car and gas and so on."
827,4,"Feb 15, 2009","BART is great.  It gets me to where I need to go and fast!  Tis why I pay the extra $2.55 to ride BART instead of hoofing it onto AC Transit.However, there are some ways BART can improve:1. Designated bicycle tie-downs in ALL cars.  Seriously, holding a bike the whole trip is a bitch.2. Cleaner seats and floors.  I did not ride BART to contract Hepatitis, thank you very much.  If I want that (And more), I can visit my friendly neighborhood prostitute.That's all I can think of for now.

829,3,"Jul 24, 2008","My blood pressure is certainly lower in writing my BART review than my Muni rant.  Must obtain biorythmn report.  A friendly and observant Peace Officer would certainly be a welcome sight at times - I salute BART Police for even showing up.  Must be god awful duty.  Much like a High School teacher must feel, dealing with seeming grown ups who act like spoiled brat rock stars with the manners of Attila the Hun.The seats are gross.  Cloth?  Come on.  Did I say gross?  Yes.  Gross.  What do they use in the Paris metro or the Tokyo subway?  Use that.  I'd say after having 10 trillion riders a day, perhaps they know what the F they are doing.  But this is America.  Why would we go ask the Dutch fer chrissakes how to build a dyke when the stupid-ass way we manage the Mississippi River and the New Orleans' levee systems seems to be working so freakin' well.  American ingenuity - oh yeah.  Right.  We're The Best.  Rah-rah.  Go Team Go.  One huge plus:  taking it to SFO.  Kudos to all.  This works.  Amazingly simple in concept.  Soooo very difficult in execution.  I mean, how many decades did it take to extend it to the airport?  (I believe about three decades.)  Watching the morons up in Seattle argue about extending their light rail system to Seatac Airport just boggles the mind.  ""A train to the airport?  Who wudda thunk?""  ""But it's not a money maker!"" they scream.  Public transportation is, by definition, not a profit center for a region.  It's like a police or fire department.  Infrastructure folks.  You know, like keeping the roads in working order so we can actually use them.  New concept for some.  Have to give these people extra time on the exam.A nice spit shine to the trains would be cool.  Maybe a new color?  I don't know.  I'm not a designer.  But dirty grey silver stainless is not a good look.    Running them all night only makes sense if you just happen to be in the lower 95th percentile of the population who find that we don't have an extra 50-60$ to pay to get back from our fave haunt in the City to our suburban home.  We don't want drunks on the roads after the bars close?  Then run public transit all night.  Of course, not every five minutes.  Duh.  But how about once every 45 to 60 minutes after 1:00 a.m.?  Overall I give BART a 3.  Certainly not perfect, but waaaay better than nothing.  Maybe our needs to be heard more loudly."
830,4,"Jan 23, 2009","BART has reallly been my key to independence.  Due to my vision disability I can't drive but can easily get on my MUNI street car to BART.    I do think the shooting incident was an abberation and  I feel relatively safe on BART,  The trains are clean, and the vast majority oof the time on time.   Someties there is elevator issues, but usually I just go to the next station and walk to my final destination.  I don't think I have ever encountered a rude station agent, though at times they could be quicker. (the new wheelchair accessible fare machines have been a godsend in this regard!) I know other places have more stops, but at least in NYC when I went, it was difficulyt to know which stops were and weren't accessible.  I find it more comparable to the Washington DC metro, and tboth of ours have gotten high marks from the disabled community. I do wish it went moore places though."
831,1,"Oct 1, 2010","I used to like Bart the first time using it.  But after using it everyday for the past 3 years the more I hate it.  Now I loathe it. 1. Never on timeThey are never on time and they run purposely slow during the mid morning through to the afternoon.  Even missed a flight once out of SFO because they were 30 min late and didn't bother to explain or warn us.  You can not depend on their schedules at all.  I wonder why they always stop at the same spot in between stations for a few minutes everyday.  I never understood that.  Perhaps they screwed up on their posted scheduling and thats how they make up for it.  But if they had some brains they would just wait at the station so that more people can have the chance to get off or get on the train.  Sitting in the middle of nowhere doesn't help anyone.2. CostThey are way way way too expensive.  To go from Pleasant Hill to SFO is 20 bucks round trip!  (minus 40 cents)  And to go one stop from SFO to the next station is 6.50!  Why?  So that the airport doesn't loose much money from the loss of airport parking?  It should be 2 or 2.50 anywhere jut like the subway in NY.  If one wants expensive traveling then take CalTrain.3. They don't go everywhereUnless you live next to a station and/or your destination is in walking distance of a station, its really not useful or economical. It's actually cheaper for me to drive than to take Bart, that doesn't make Bart very green. I can never get folks to want to take Bart, its way to inconvenient and if you have 2 or more people its not affordable, like if you want to take it to the city, expect to drop 24-48 dollars for a small group of people. That is crazy!Only reason I take it is that my company pays for some of my ticket and I can walk to it from work and home.  I'd rather drive to tell ya the truth, though I hate to pollute unnecessarily, but remember that electricity isn't necessarily harmless to the environment either.At least the stations out in the walnut creek area are clean.  :)  I guess paying union fees up the yin yang does do something for them."
832,2,"Oct 28, 2011",when it works its great but all this week its been a mess and I have been late all too many times. I am so inclined to start using a motorbike or car..Lets face it it is expensive travel so they must be able to provide a reliable service.
833,2,"Feb 9, 2017",Better than driving on packed freeways but late a lot. The information on delays they give out online and over the speakers inside BART is frequently wrong in the sense that it's over or understated. Can't hear the announcements.
836,4,"Jun 26, 2015","I just wrote a review for the AirBart and felt it necessary to write a review for it's parent:  Bart.  Also, I read a few of the negative reviews, as I tend to do.  I understand out-of-towner's frustrations.  As a long time resident of the Bay Area, I have seen how our public transportation system is no where near as convenient as Chicago's L Train or NYC's Subway.  In fact, it is damn difficult to navigate around the city.  If you do not do your homework in advance you can lose valuable time just working out how to get to your desired location.  Whether it's by Bart, Muni, cable cars, bus, or a combination of all of them; San Francisco is a mess.  I couldn't imagine navigating the city and trying to see the Palace of Fine Arts, AT&T Park, and the Painted Ladies in Alamo Park, all in the same day.  Whereas in the aforementioned Chicago and NYC, all it takes is a couple of transfers and you arrive within blocks of your destination.  So in this regard, yes we are lacking.Another area that they are lacking is in pricing.  Sure they offer a Clipper card with minimal savings on how much you load onto it, but for the most part Bart is not tourist friendly.  Cities like Chicago, Pittsburgh, NYC, and many others, offer a variety of passes that are beneficial to tourists.  Whether it's a multi-day pass, a week's pass, or a month, it provides tourists unlimited travel through their city's public transportation system for the allotted number of days purchased.  I don't know how many times this has saved me money on my travels!  Every time I visit cities with this option it upsets me that the Bay Area has been slow to adopt some sort of ""weekend pass"" that would encourage using their public transportation.  For that ... one star deduction.  For the reviewers from the Bay Area ... sure Bart may not be ""clean,"" but what public transportation system is?  You sit in the seats at your own risk.  Standing is ALWAYS an option, just make sure you always carry a thing of Purell ;)  I've seen the clientele that frequent Bart and am amazed that it doesn't look worse!  I think they do a great job cleaning/updating all of their cars.  Like some of the other Yelpers have stated, it sure beats the bus :)In terms of being on time, I have the Bart app on my phone and things thing has been a life saver.  If I am at the game, restaurant, or bar, I can plan my departure with the trains arrival to make the most out of my evening.  No wasteful waiting around for 5-15 minutes for the next train.  Sure delays happen, but for a system that runs all year they do a fine job.  Just make sure that if you are cutting it close that you just pick up your kids and haul tail to the station.  So to wrap this up, I gave it 4-stars because of how useful Bart has been for me.  For Giants games, city events, touring downtown Oakland or San Francisco, and getting to the airports, Bart beats driving.  Just plan ahead, estimate the time needed, and be fully prepared to see some interesting characters.  Sit and touch things at your own risk.  As they say ... ""Bart and you are there.  Boop Boop""SIDENOTE:  For all the visitors to the Bay Area ... Watch out for panhandlers.  They are more cunning and creative as time passes.  The last guy I saw was VERY convincing, but was a liar and a cheat all the same.  Do not fall for them.  The last guy I saw asked everyone in the Bart for their attention and gave this speech:""Oh man,  Oh geeze, this is embarrassing.  Hi everyone, and thank you for your time *insert fake tears/crying*  My son is at SFO and just missed his flight to Chicago.  He has $130, but was told he needs $300 for a ticket.  I have already collected $90 from the previous car, from such caring people, and just needs help to cover the remaining $80.  I am a Veteran of the Army and served in Iraq as a medic.  Whatever you give to me I promise to mail you double as long as you provide me your address.  *More tears and sniffling*  My boy is scared and won't ask anyone for help.  I need any amount for him.  Please help!""Needless to say many people chipped in.  From my estimation he made $65 from the car I was in alone.  Only reason I know is because I was sitting near the door to the next car he was going to hit up and saw the money in his hand.  Not only that, but the guy in front of me gave him $20.  Convincing right?!?  I almost believed the story too ... that is, until he moved to the next train car and started the speech again.  Guess what .... He still needed $80!  He just regurgitated the same speech he gave the car before.  Funny thing was, once he saw me (who he recognized from the previous train) he quickly collected whatever money from the car he could and got off at the next stop.  Why didn't I call him out?  I was so dumbfounded at the level he sank to.  Since then I have beat myself up for not exposing him, but here I am to redeem myself.  So ... if you see this guy (usually on the weekends)  DO NOT FALL FOR IT."
837,4,"Jun 26, 2015","I am a BIG fan of Bart.  It is convenient, fast, and the easiest way to avoid traffic.  When this finally opened up I was excited at the possibility of finding flights out of Oakland OR San Francisco AND being able to access either one by a train system.  My big surprise was the cost for a one way travel.  It was $6 for this 8-10 minute ride.  This is my primary reason for giving it a 4 star rating instead of 5 stars.  Comparing it to SFO, the connection from the station to the other terminals is free.  Granted Bart takes you right up to the ""SFO Airport"" stop.  Comparisons aside, I am pleased that AirBart is up and running.  It now becomes another factor in my travel planning.  It all comes down to plane ticket price (out of OAK or SFO), travel time to the airport via Bart, and the convenience factor.  All in all, I recommend using AirBart, but just be prepared for the cost!  All things considered, some times the airfare out of Oakland is cheaper than out of SFO; when adding in the price of Bart it all comes out in the wash.  I will take a 40 minute Bart ride over a hour and 25 minute Bart ride from the Dublin station ANY DAY!!"
838,1,"Sep 5, 2014",Yay!!! Another day I get to miss my transfer train. That's five this month. Update. 10/2 Train stuck on platform. Moved all passengers off trains up to another platform. 10 minutes later we go back down. 30 minute delay.
839,1,"Jul 3, 2014",SF BART totally screwed OAK Airport customers today by NOT taking BART cards and forcing us to come up with cash! NO warning. NO signs. NO exception. NO time to walk anywhere to get cash and make our flights!
840,1,"May 9, 2014",Sucks compared to all the other public transits in other metropolitan cities. BART did improve by changing to plastic seat covers from cloth.
841,4,"Sep 5, 2015",To Use the ticket machine you have to pay first and then you can choose your options to buy what tickets you need so put your money in the machine only gives you back change $4.50 so you have to be very exact.
842,1,"Feb 22, 2015","So incompetent. 20% of the time you take it, it gets delayed. ""We appreciate your patience,"" I'm calling bullshit. They would do something to fix the problems if they actually cared about our patience, but they just take our cash and laugh at us."
843,1,"May 8, 2014","3 short meetings, hours apart, all near BART. You think you can make it? I know NOT.When I got home dinner no longer was HOT. If you have something to get done, DRIVE YOUR CAR"
844,1,"Oct 14, 2015","20-30 minute delays are a fairly regular regular occurrence (2-3/week for me); medical emergencies due to poor air circulation in ancient, over-packed cars; filth everywhere.Is it better than driving still?  Maybe, but it's definitely a legitimate debate at this point.Aging infrastructure, lack of maintenance, and most importantly, poor planning have taken a major toll on the system."
845,1,"Jan 6, 2015","Everyday... Every damn day there is a medical emergency on the 8am trains. If you have meetings for work, you better plan on taking Bart 2 hours early if you want to hopefully be on time. Completely unreliable and worthless."
846,1,"Nov 8, 2011","Dear BART, I didnt know a train could be a tyrant and a monopoly, but you prove me wrong. Thank you for not caring about your customers WHATSOEVER. You insist on making those customers that ride you everyday to use a Clipper, as outlets will no longer offer tickets in turn for vouchers. The Clipper often doesnt allow you to get through stalls efficiently, which results in us missing trains. You made my boyfriend spend $5.20 to enter a station, pay for my parking, and immediately leave said station. Guess why he had to do that for me? THE CLIPPER MAGICALLY WASNT WORKING. How strange!I would like to add you to the ""Occupy Oakland"" list. Thank you, BART, for more often than not, getting my day off to a bad start. And shame on you for making so much money on us! It must be going into training your highly qualified BART police, no??"
849,5,"May 30, 2012",Yaaaaaahh!! Finally new seats!!! It was very pleasant to ride today in a BART car that had new seat covers. I think they probably should of gone darker in color since they are made out of some sort of vinyl material it won't be long before graffiti is alll over their brand new clean look.
850,4,"Jun 29, 2012","BART is a good system San Fran has. I got a clipper card and it worked on all the public transportation systems in San Fran. The clipper card allows you to put any amount on it so you can charge the card for whatever you think you will use. Also, you can charge the card at a local Walgreens or at a local BART station ATM. The BART employees were help full and informative. I like the public transportation system you guys have and the connectivity to local buses is good as well.You do have to improve on the speakers and letting travelers know where they are and what stop the train is stopped at. I couldn't  hear a thing coming out of the speakers as to which stops we are stopping at and I almost missed my stop so you need better signs on what each stop is and the speakers need to be better as well so we know where we stopping at. Same goes for each station. When we are stopped at the civic center stop the maps there doent help much with the timing on when each train comes and how long it takes to get to a certain location. Over all good but just need to make some improvements."
851,3,"Mar 31, 2012","DONT BUY BART TICKETS FROM SOMEONE YOU DON'T KNOW!there are lots of them for sale on craigslist. beware!My girlfriend had three credit cards stolen from her purse last night, while at an art show off Market street. Before we even realized what had happened,the thief purchased over $1000 in BART cards from the civic center BART station. We reported it very quickly. These tickets can be tracked by the police and BART will cancel them.Buying BART cards from credit card thieves may save you a couple bucks, but it perpetuates crime against hard working honest people."
852,3,"Aug 7, 2014","Overall I like BART but their evening/night scheduling is poor and could be greatly improved.  People will use BART more when the wait times are less and you can count on efficient transportation.  So instead of 10 car trains every 20 minutes at night you should have 4 car trains every 6 or 7 minutes so that no matter when you show up there is only a couple minutes wait to the next train - like a real city and like nearly every major public transit in the world.  Oh gosh, Stan, doesn't that mean having more drivers on duty?  Why yes, BART, but I guarantee that $30/hour burdened cost will be more than made up by revenue gains for what, five extra riders per hour, when people can count on quick and convenient service."
853,2,"Feb 4, 2012","I really have no idea why people give Bart 3 and 4 stars. This is a 2 star ride at best and it only gets those stars because of locations and general safety (because when the Bart police will kill you crime seems to go down).I have been on trains and subways all over in the US and Europe and with the waiting times between trains, number of people being forced into cars because of the waits, and the price - they have a long way to go to hit a 4 star level or above. The smell is pretty bad as well - right on par with L.A. except with less exhaust fumage mixed in.At least with my hybrid I don't feel guilty taking my car and being clean and germ free upon arriving to my destination!"
854,5,"Jun 22, 2006","I don't regularly use Bart or any of the public transportation and I didn't today either - but that's because I don't need it (I walk to work). But I think its a great thing, and I think it's wonderful that they have Spare the Air Day and promote it by giving a day of free public transportation. That is awesome initiative to promote pubic transportation and raise awareness of the problems of pollution. So for that, I give BART 5 stars!"
855,4,"Mar 31, 2014","Overall, BART provides the best way to get around the eastern side of SF and the western side of the East Bay.  It is about as cheap as driving particularly if you are crossing the Bay and have to pay toll.  It saves time too - it can take an hour (sometimes over two even on weekends) to get from Berkeley/Oakland to SF during peak hour, versus some 25 minutes on BART.  BART is not too cheap, but let's be real.  It operates in the one of the most expensive areas in the country.  The Bay also does not have the population to lower cost through ticket sales, so I don't think comparing NYC's cost to BART is fair.  On a weekday, more than 6x more people ride the NY metro than live in the City by the bay.  That has to be taken into caccount when casting judgement between the two systems.BART is expanding their computer systems to increase the number of trains running, and they seem to be making some important expansions to the South Bay which will provide them a better way to get to SF than Caltrain, although the upcoming electrification of Caltrain will improve its service around the time BART reaches Diridon.  Now, the bad:  I am not going to complain about the clientele being rowdy, drunk, or homeless.  This is an urban metro system, you will have to deal with people that are not like you.  Yes, Ive on many occasions witnessed crazies or ""police activity"" between Civic Center and 24th st, but I have never felt in any danger.  I know this is a long shot, and there is a good reason for MUNI to do this instead of BART, but the City needs some better form of transit into the Richmond.  If not MUNI, BART should expand (or plan to expand) under Geary and eventually across the Golden Gate into Marin (which is the reason BART should do it instead of MUNI, as MUNI doesn't operate in Marin).  BART is expanding their inefficient E-BART service to Contra Costa, a sparsely populated area when compared to the Richmond.  Yes, it would be be exponentially more expensive to tunnel under Geary and build under the Golden Gate, but it would provide much needed traffic relief to Geary and the Golden Gate, as well as direct public transit from the rest of the Bay to Marin, northern SF, and Golden Gate Park.  This is what the City's traffic needs the most.  My biggest qualm about BART is its operating hours.  What will it take to get 24 hour service?  They always say that they need to close the Tube every day for maintenance.  I don't buy that.  Why can't you run single track between 1am and 5am?  What is the issue with having one train every 30 minutes cross the bay during night hours, exactly what they do on New Years and other holidays?  Honestly, at least run the Sunday schedule at 1/5 sunday capacity so people won't be stranded after midnight.  What will it take?  More ridership?  Well SF's population is expanding, and so is the East Bay's.  At least give us an extremely limited service during night hours."
856,1,"Jun 26, 2013","BART UNION BOOOO - Shame on you.It is incomprehensible to the average worker, who has to earn their pay increases, (small ones at that) and has to pay for a percentage, if not all of their medical benefits, to watch the BART Unions bleed everything they can from their employer.  The BART Unions continue to drive our fares up and up and then takes as much as they can, so that there is nothing left to spend on decent facilities and services.  Shame on you for being so greedy!  When a Union steps in to protect the workers to the degree that they no longer have to perform, it is a slap in the face to the average worker.  We watch as BART employees do less than their best at keeping their stations clean and operable.  We put up with rude and mouthy BART employees that have NO sense of customer service.  We stand by, helpless, as the Unions demand pay increases and threaten strikes when people all over this nation are taking pay cuts and getting laid off.  On occasion a BART employee goes out of their way and has a nice disposition, but these employee's are rare and we thank the UNIONS for creating these monsters that feel they are owed unjust pay and benefits.Shame on you!"
857,2,"May 28, 2015","The parking fees used to be $1, now it's $3. Luckily I was able to take the Contra Costa County Connection express bus and leave the car at home, it was also useful with not being stuck in traffic with all the other morons who can't drive around here.2.  The trains are usually crowded, but before I even get to what goes on inside the train, let me elaborate on what's going on when you stand inline. People come in at the last moment and just pass you and the line like you're not there.3. Then you get to the train and things become even more interesting, you'll encounter all sorts of characters.  Homeless people whom you can smell from a mile away, mentally ill people who will be screaming/cussing and talking about all their problems, stuck up CA women who spend too much time on their smart phone and wondering who they will marry and how much money they will gain and the list goes on.4. Hopefully you'll find a decent seat without urine, feces or some other crap all over it.5. Then it's time to get off the train (MacArthur Station) and you can barely get off the train because of the swarm of people outside waiting to come on-board.  I usually greet them with LET ME GET OFF THE TRAIN PLEASE!! in a nice loud commanding voice (works most of the time).6. The bathrooms are DISGUISTING,   filth, urine, dirt, graffiti etc etc.  You'd be better off waiting or pissing your pants. 7. Coming back and getting off the train in Walnut Creek trying to grab a discount ticket for the bus, people pretend like you are not there or they don't see you.I am so GLAD to leave California and this $h1ty BART behind."
858,2,"Jan 15, 2014","Works decently most of the time to fulfill its main function, which is obviously to transport people around the Bay Area. Unfortunately, BART lags behind many other public transportation systems. Trains are all old and clearly not designed to cope with high volumes of traffic, with only 2 doors per side in each train and transverse seats make for narrow aisles, meaning it's hard to move around within the car. No public information displays or automated announcements regarding next station or interchange info. Motors and screeching wheels get inordinately loud, drowning out the voice of the operator as well as any conversations you might be having. The cloth seats and floors all look dirty. No mobile phone reception in some tunnels. The fact that BART runs trains of differing lengths can be a bit confusing at first as well. Stations are all aging and definitely show it, although some modifications help a bit. The black vs. yellow tiles to indicate where the doors will be positioned are helpful, and there are screens showing when the next trains are due. Other than that, poor signage in general. A lot of stations just have that drab Brutalist look so it's hard to tell what station you're at. Fare gates are old and slow; Clipper card readers don't read the cards very well and it takes multiple taps to register at times. Ticket/Clipper top-up machines aren't user-friendly and are clunky to use. Cross-platform timed interchanges are perhaps one of the few things that BART has managed to get right. Clear labour issues; why are strikes even permitted for a service that's clearly so essential to the Bay Area? Staff, when they're working, are often surly and unhelpful. Fares are relatively high, although definitely cheaper than driving. Direct access to SFO is nice, and is actually a serviceable way to get to the airport if you don't have too much luggage."

862,2,"Feb 27, 2015","I am all for mass transport, but BART housekeeping has been lacking. Lots of debris between seats on the Pittsburgh/Bay Point line, and either some foul odor, or the unbearable smell of harsh chemicals, other lines are even dirtier. I really hope they shape up soon, as I wonder how many people receive illness from taking BART, one time as I was sitting down, I noticed used toilet paper jammed between the seat and the wall...that is a recipe for disaster..."

864,4,"Oct 11, 2009","I was charged about 8.00 dollars to go from SF Intl Airport to the 24th and Mission station, which wasn't too bad. It did not take long to get to our destination because Bart was fast on the straightaways. I also used it to go back to SFO. I really like that you could use a Debit card to purchase your ticket. It was on time and not complicated."
865,4,"Jul 13, 2007","I grew up taking BART, so maybe I'm just generous for sentimental reasons. For all the crap BART gets, they're actually a lot more efficient and pleasant to take than other transit systems in other major cities. Have you checked out the Paris Metro, the London Underground, or the New York Subway? (OK, maybe not quite the same as the Metro, Underground, or Subway, but along the same lines...) I can't speak to promptness but I can speak to cleanliness and comfort level. Considering the grand aspirations of the BART designers (cloth upholstery, carpeting, etc...) and the quality of a fraction of the riders, this crap is pretty damn pleasant to ride on. Also, aside from the sporadic tube fires, suicide jumpers, and criminal activity, there are few serious delays. A frequent inter-San Francisco rider, I notice the delays a lot more than your standard commuter and I still give them 4 stars. The smooth ride usually puts me so at ease that I am able to fall asleep and miss my stop. When this happens (which is often), I thank god that BART does run frequently enough that I can hop on a train running the opposite direction and still get to my intended destination in a reasonable amount of time. Minus one point for the ease with which the tickets demagnetize, forcing me to visit the little BART staff window at least once a week and forcing me to lose countless dollars throwing away the demagnetized tickets instead of going through the hassle of getting the demagnetized tickets replaced. The BART stations are also pretty okay, my only complaint is the lack of bathrooms. But that's just so people don't smoke crack in them. And crack is bad. So I can support that. Don't smoke crack and don't hate on BART. If they raise prices one more time, they lose a star from this rider."
866,2,"Jun 2, 2015","Bart has been failing to automate their trains and schedules for 40 years.Every time I 'need' BART to be on-time, they are 20 minutes late.Today, I checked online when the next Pittsburg/Bay Point train would arrive in Oakland.The BART web page said 10 minutes.I walked to the BART station, swiped my card, got to the platform (packed with stranded people) and once again, the train is 20 minutes late.This seems to be a once a week occurrence at 19th street during rush hour.   I left the station.  To enter the station and then immediately leave cost $5.60 !!!!  Having ridden BART for 40 years, I have finally had enough of their pompous arrogance and poor service.  If your schedule permits you to be late and miss bus connections (and you don't mind shoulder-to-shoulder standing BO during rush hour), BART is an acceptable car alternative.It is back to the car for me!"

""let's encourage drunk driving by not running the BART past 12:30 so that we can give out more tickets!  AND people from the east bay will get stuck here on the weekends so they'll either have to take taxis home or stay in a hotel = more money for SF.""the only two redeeming qualities BART has, in my opinion, are: it earned coolness points for being in the film ""THX 1138"" and it' s better for the environment than driving a gas hogging vehicle.dear BART HQ,please run the BART 24 hours to cut down on drunk drivers.  please clean up your nasty trains& stations.  i think your prices have gone up TWICE in the past year and have we seen any of the benefits come back to us as riders?

Nice, SO convenient, & sometimes MUCH needed in the morning.-It links directly to SFO and OAK airports.Tips:-If you encounter a homeless person talking to themself, better to leave them alone.  -Don't be a meanie and sit on the ""outer"" seat when the ""inner seat"" only occupies your bag. Having a bag doesn't constitute an extra seat.-Don't try & slip your way into a train that's in process of shutting its doors. Chances are you'll get stuck & cause a delay on the train. Relax, there will be another train coming soon. =)-Do remember take ALL your belongings with you. If you leave behind your lunch bag, they will delay the ride to ""inspect"" the contents.-When on the escalator departing the station, make sure you stay on the RIGHT side if you don't plan on walking. Tourists standing on the left side often get sighs and groans from people wanting to get through. SO, if you didn't know, NOW you know.-Lastly, just SMILE. Hardly anyone on BART does it anymore, and frankly if you do its pretty contagious. Let's get some friendly faces on your daily commute to work people!! =)"
873,5,"Aug 20, 2005","I ride BART roughly twice a year, when I need to fulfill family obligations and visit my cousin and his wife in Walnut Creek. It's not convenient unless you're within walking distance of a station (which I'm not), but it's clean, runs on schedule, and allows me to read or doze instead of dealing with traffic on the Bay Bridge. If I'm going to be subjected to my cousin's wife's dreadful cooking, I may as well be comfortable getting there and back. No doubt regular users are aware of all its flaws, but for once-in-awhile riders like myself, it's a viable alternative to driving and a lot less expensive than a tankful of gas."

875,2,"Aug 25, 2015","This is for out-of-area visitors in order to set expectations correctly.1.  If you arrive during rush hour, be prepared for shorter trains. BART runs short trains during the peak hours. Don't ever expect to have a seat.2. No matter when you arrive, use the facilities at your airport or hotel. The BART restrooms are either always locked (downtown stations) or filthy and with a drug addict inside.3.  The air conditioning doesn't work in many of the train cars, so don't expect comfort.4.  The escalators in stations aren't always working. For example, the escalator in the Embarcadero station has been under repair for 3 weeks. Elevators are also unreliable, so pack lightly, you may be carrying your luggage for a long walk.5.  Bicycles have priority over any other passengers, so expect someone with a bike to push on the train no matter how crowded, rush hour or not. BART has no idea how to manage bicycles, so they just let them run rampant. You'll see.6.  Frequent breakdowns, police actions, medical emergencies mean that BART is extremely unreliable; you must have lots of patience to take this transport.7.  In an emergency, you won't be able to contact the train operator via the in-car intercoms, they don't work. Just get off the train safely.Good luck, enjoy the Bay Area, be prepared for BART."

877,5,"Jun 14, 2007","I love this little mobile site.  I use it all the time.  Once the ""Advisories"" section is up and running it will be perfect.  It tells me when the train should be coming, which train(s) I should take, and it tells me if I can bring my bike with me.  It also has a link to the system map right on the homepage which is just oh so nice!"
878,4,"May 2, 2007","It's like the monorail except it smells like urine and it doesn't go to Disney World.  It's fairly consistent, cheaper than other trains, and runs frequently (but could run later).  It can also be a bit confusing for people who are new to the system.The environmentalist in me is compelled to give it the forth star.  ...and I love the BART mobile site.  You can check quickly and easily exactly when the next train should be coming, check for advisories, and bike rules.It'd be better if the seats came with headphone jacks like there are on airplanes and if there were cellphone signal boosters on the train.  Boo on the people who complain about people being on their phones!  We could never be as annoying as Oakland highschool students shouting profanity at each other because they think it makes them look cool!"
879,3,"Feb 13, 2009","I envy cities with real subway systems, i.e., those that actually connect the different parts of a city (I am from Los Angeles; I don't know what *that* is).  In addition to the usual top dogs--New York City (genius), Paris (wonderful), Seoul (smooth sailing), Tokyo (complete with passenger protocol), Hong Kong (I bust out my Octopus Card and I'm good to go), London (other than some parts of outer London, connects A-okay)--Washington, D.C. springs to mind as a small community that is serviced by a most efficient, bafflingly clean Metro.Now the comparison, or contrast, rather, with BART.  This bloody thing does not even attempt to connect the relatively small square footage (for a major metropolitan city and population) of San Francisco.  I get that it is for the Bay Area, in general, which is why I am giving it 3 stars.  But, if you do not work in East Bay or South Bay, thus just using BART for a simple one direction commute, you can fuhgetaboutit.  I wanted to go to this mouthwateringly amazing pizza place that happens to be in Potrero Hill and my friend replied, ""There's no BART stop there.""  Damnit, thanks for bringing me here, BART, from Berkeley, but would it kill you to drop me off on your way down to Burlingame?  This is when MUNI steps in and takes over, but those buses hardly move like clockwork.  And the things you witness on them give you a bit of pause.  Not that I can't roll like that.  I don't really care, as soap and water takes care of nearly everything.  But, like I said, they are never on time.  My last annoyance about BART is that it is kind of expensive for what it is.  A few more dollars than D.C.'s Metro, but the Metro will take you everywhere, including Bethesda, MD.  Just not the biggest fan of BART."
880,1,"Nov 3, 2016",I have been commuting since 2004 from North concord to so san francisco and trains dirty and over crowded and always late. Bart suck and bart police lazy !!!!

881,4,"Jun 30, 2008","haha, oh bart. we've shared some good times.i remember when i was a little girl, my dad never told me that bart goes underwater because he knew i'd get scared. and he was right. when i found out i got scared and was crossing my fingers the entire time underwater. Anyway, 10 years later and i still get a little nervous. haha. i just sit there praying that an earthquake doesn't hit.But i am willing to pay 10 bucks, risk my life, and be back on it by 12 if it gets me out of driving. if i need to stay out later than that i just crash at a friends in San Fran, or by a bum on the stairs. body heat, people.but really. if you're planning on staying in San Fran late and getting intoxicated, being on bart isn't a good idea. Either you pass out on a seat and miss your stop, or you get extremely DIZZZZZZZZZZY and paranoid. but if you're a trooper like me, just suck it up and do it. or drive yourself.tis up to you."
882,5,"Jun 20, 2008","""Lucy!, You have some explaining to do!"" Lets be honest with ourselves here. BART kind of sucks.  It only has one line though all of San Francisco, and the seats covers are so old not even the homeless want to sit down.  But the biggest problem is: IT CLOSES AT MID-NIGHT! No how are any of the East Bay kids going to come over to SF to hang out if they always have to leave by 11:00? Huge design flaw.  That's like operating a commuter shuttle service in a city with no airport."

Yesterday I came home a bit later because I had a farewell drink with a collegue.  Everybody's worst fear while on Bart....happened.  While I was in the tube under the bay coming home a 5.6 earthquake hit.  The biggest since '89.  Keep in mind I ride from the Embarcadero to west Oakland, that's a total of 6 minutes on the train.  They stopped the train in the tube for 10 minutes and announced that there was a signifigant shake.  The woman next to me started saying hail marys.

I can say I don't miss the stained seats, rude passengers, and electronic device enthralled zombie crowds. I will however miss the diversity of people that cross bart paths - from hippie to drug dealers to rich ceo types who are going through the commuter phase for a week. It's a beautiful array of weirdos and regulars and almost always unpredictably inefficient. One little minor hiccup at a train station four stops away will throw your whole game off by 45 minutes. That I won't miss. It's one thing to be late because of something I can control, but to know I paid $4. for a transit malfunction to occur just pisses me off even as I type.farewell, Bart.

Starts later on the weekends. No, it's not that balding neighbor in the bathrobe. It's a public transit system which is ridiculously overpriced, and may give you a virus which actually kills 19,000 people per year.Yes indeed, kids. Just because they've successfully colluded to remain the only semi-reasonable choice to get places (like SFO) doesn't mean you have to support them. I drive whenever I possibly can in the bay because I always feel dirty and violated after being taken for a BART ride. Ten bucks to the airport?? I'd rather stay healthy and make it in half the time by using a shuttle service for $30. What is your health and sanity worth to you? Seriously.If you're down to listen to someone else's music, engage a crazy person in unsolicited conversation, wonder whether the cushion you're on has any of the things the professor in the article found, pay four times as much as a New Yorker or a Bostonian to ride for an hour, contribute to overpaid workers' salaries and bonuses, all while spending just enough not to have a car, then BART is for you!I've found used tissues, condoms, and a loaded diaper all in the last year of my infrequent-as-possible rides. On many parts of the system, you can't make a phone call because of the ridiculous screeching noises. People yell to continue their conversations through the ""trans-bay tube"".  And forget BART helping you get home from a night of drinking, if that's your forte - last train out is around midnight. Forcing people to drive if they want to stay out late is great. And safe.Want super job security, though? Get hired with BART if you can feel good about taking money you don't deserve from others. You'll have a cushy job pushing buttons (which can then be overridden by the control center which is actually running the show anyway), mumbling into a microphone about some stations you're coming up to, and you probably won't get fired unless you just don't show up for a month, or you punch someone in full view of passengers. You'll get close to $100,000 a year to start for ""operating"" a train; $70,000 annually to sit on your well fed tuchis behind glass giving attitude to riders at a station; $90000 to stand around watching that one guy work on one of the trains (it takes a village of supervisors to make things work in the bay area).Yes, BART truly is the way to be taken for a ride if you can't afford a car (because you're spending so much on BART every day), don't want to stay out late, don't have an hour to try and park downtown, or are otherwise desperate to get somewhere. Bring your wallets - and Lysol!"
890,1,"Jul 12, 2009","As of July 1st, it now costs $9.90 EACH WAY from Pleasant Hill to SFO. Thank you, BART, for not ""punishing"" your ""loyal commuters"" who make a ton of money. It makes more sense to punish the food service and ramp workers at the airport, forcing them to pay $5 more per day, or drive and pay for parking, since they make considerably more money than those ""loyal commuters"" who work in the office buildings of San Francisco.BOYCOTT BART & DRIVE! These people are corrupt, greedy THIEVES."
891,1,"Mar 10, 2009","I'm with Matt H and give this incredibly craptacular public transit system exactly what it's earned - ONE STAR. (can't pick zero)I could write an entire essay on why BART is the absolute bottom of the barrel for public transit, but I will stick to a few points:-BART is overpriced - for a reason. BART executives make six-figure incomes each year, give themselves raises, and bonuses, and do virtually NOTHING with the excessive amount of money they abscond when you ride. When was the last time you got on an unscented BART train? When was the last time you stopped and thought to yourself, ""Wow, this is a clean station!""? When was the last time you were able to use a restroom at a station? And if it was recent, were you afraid to touch anything inside, including the floor?? The answer to all 3 questions: 1975 or thereabouts.Not only do Bay Area residents pay into the mediocrity which is BART through the 1/4% added sales tax, but many who DO pay that extra tax are nowhere close to a station! For the nearly $15 it costs to get to the airport from Contra Costa, what has BART done to show for it? LINED THEIR POCKETS with the money from yours! Which brings me to the next point...-BART is corrupt. ""Expose"" articles were printed on the front pages of major Bay Area newspapers a few years ago, decrying the excessive earnings of everyone from the execs to the drivers (who make $30+ an hour - to START!), and outlining in detail how corrupt and money-hungry the BART setup is. It was outrageous! It was appalling! It was upsetting! And yet what did the complacent, supposedly outraged Bay Area residents do the next day...?? THEY RODE THE TRAIN! Way to go, Bay Area. You get what you deserve.-Fares are more expensive than gasoline - even last year when it was over $3 a gallon!To drive from Pleasant Hill to SFO (roughly 40 miles) costs about $4.50 in today's gas price. BART ticket price: $7.05, which adds up to a staggering $14.10. In NYC, that would get you SEVEN one-way rides to anywhere on the subway. In Boston, you'd get more than EIGHT one-way rides anywhere. Distance-based pricing is a JOKE. But it certainly ensures the continued fat-cat salaries of the unionized lackeys running the monopolistic BART system. Oh, and if you're going with at least one friend on BART, consider this: Round-trip fare for two to SFO - $28.20; gas + bridge toll in a car with only 20mpg - $13.00. That's MORE THAN TWICE the cost. Carpooling for a night on the town? The per-person savings is a no-brainer, even if you valet your car in the city!-Inefficiency runs rampant, and is completely unpredictable.My wondrous jaunt on the illustrious BART yesterday took me from the Oakland Airport to Walnut Creek. Of course, I had to transfer trains, and in typical BART style, their definition of ""commute hours"" for the Pittsburg-Gun Point train meant that after 5:48pm, trains would only be coming every 15 minutes or so. Very practical. No shock that once the train pulled in (3 minutes late), it was packed to the gills and i barely fit in, leaning onto the ""DO NOT LEAN ON DOORS"" sign to avoid sexually harassing the people around me. These trains are about as punctual as Alaska Airlines, with the customer service attitude of United Airlines, and the trains look like a UPS package - beaten and filthy.-Smells, sights, sounds!Less than two weeks ago, I was again forced to ride the revolting trains to the east bay. As I boarded at Coliseum station, a mother and her boyfriend/baby daddy disembarked. Once I was on board, I noticed that they'd left a present for the next riders: a Subway bag with napkins in it, and next to it, a rolled up dirty diaper. Surprising? Not at all. So, attempting to be helpful, I picked the diaper up carefully and dropped it into the Subway bag and left it on the seat. When I reached my transfer station, I picked the bag up with one pinky finger and carried it to what I'd hoped would be a nearby trash can. Well, there was NO TRASH CAN on the platform! I ended up being forced to leave it on a bench. Maybe that teenage mom was smarter than me - she knew there would be few, if any, places to leave the damn thing!-Safety: Our Number Twelve PrioritySure, we all know that you may be one of the lucky winners of a gunshot to the back, but that's just the BART Police. When they're not around, there's no shortage of savory characters riding all around you. Even in commute time. Join in on a conversation the person next to you is having with themselves out loud. Rock back and forth in sync with the homeless. Pick up the beat of a nearby inconsiderate rider's blaring iPod. Bring something messy to eat - if it drips all over the seat, the 1970s upholstery will absorb it in no time. And from today's BART website -Today's Special: Station AdvisoriesThere is a 15-minute delay at San Francisco Int'l Airport in the SF / Pittsburg-Bay Point direction due to police activity.Enough said. GO BART!"
892,2,"Jun 9, 2005","BART is too expensive for the service it provides and I'd really like to know why it is so expensive and so glitchy.  For example, they paid some hefty sum to a contractor for some switching software, I believe, when the new extension to Millbrae/SFO was built, but that software is reportedly screwed up and trains are often delayed as a result, making commutes down there frustrating.  My understanding is they are sitting around waiting for the contractor and the sub-contractor to sort out who needs to fix the software.  This is sheer bullshit.  This is a huge public organization and it needs to grow some hair and start kicking ass and taking names until that software is FIXED.  I've heard the most laughably wimpy public statements by BART representatives on this, saying things like ""Our hands our tied, because it's a dispute between the contractor and subcontractor...""  My customers wouldn't put up with that, my public agencies shouldn't either. But while I'm handing out brickbats, the people of the Peninsula should be ASHAMED of themselves for rejecting BART--which is my understanding of why it doesn't go down the Peninsula.  With a larger rider pool and comprehensive coverage, and more frequent and fast service compared to Caltrain, BART could presumably dramatically increase its ridership to pay the general overhead and make a huge impact on the horrific traffic on our highways in these areas.   While San Francisco is patting itself on the back in being named this week the Greenest City in the country, the broader Bay Area should hang our heads in shame that our mass transit is this jumbled and poorly utilized."

897,5,"Jun 21, 2005","UPDATE: Bart now gets five stars because they have just become the only public transit service in the entire United States that makes it cheaper for me to drive my car wantonly through the Bay Area. Now I can avoid your piss-soaked, stinky service. THANKS!If I could give BART a half star rating, I would.  Bart claims that it is the best transportation system in the country.  The ads are plastered on trains, posters and in stations.  Oh, and by the way let's not call them trains.  Train implies that there are comfortable seats, nice scenery (not tunnels of darkness), amenities and interesting destinations (not Fremont and Richmond).  More like monorail.  Whoever ranked this the best system in the country has issues, or there was no competition; like a baseball team that wins due to a forfeit.  Bart is constantly breaking down, the system costs way too much to use for the distances that are offered.  It costs nearly three dollars to ride from West Oakland to San Francisco.  That is a distance of roughly seven miles.  You get no transfers so once you leave the station, screw you buddy.  Come back in and pull your pants down and cough it up for another fun ride on the single line going to nowhere.  The problem with the transportation around here is a lack of shared systems.  Bart, SamTrans, MUNI, and AC Transit cannot continue to survive working separately and fees for each will continue to skyrocket and make a trip on the London Underground seem like pennies.  Oh and don't even bother staying in the city for a drink or ten if you live anywhere outside the city.  Bart wants you to apparently get in your car and drive across the hideous Bay Bridge drunk, and failing that they would much rather you pass out in a heap on the electric third rail of their horrid 1960s designed beehive stations.  San Francisco is one of the best cities in the world, yet the main transpo cannot manage to run 24 hours?  Buses and transportation systems in Omaha probably run longer hours.  Next time Bart wants to crown itself the best transportation system in the country, they better at least ask their riders."

On previous visits to the Bay area, I would normally either rent a car or drive my own vehicle to the area. However, on my most recent trip to San Francisco, my friends insisted that we opt for public transportation.We took the BART from a station near Oakland Airport to Downtown San Francisco (and back for our return trip). Certainly, the time it took utilizing the BART as opposed to driving in a personal car or taxi was fractional; it saved a lot of time (though there was a few minutes in which our train was stopped/delayed in the underwater tunnel). Moreover, the cost was certainly reasonable -- as we didn't have to pay for a rental car, fuel, tolls, or parking.All in all, public transportation in SF rocks! I'm a big fan now."

Yeah sure put all the blame on the unions. What a childish ""it's not me it's them"" way to communicate.BART Management's communication has been so poor throughout the 6+ months the bargaining has been taking place, I am losing faith in BART's ability to manage.

908,4,"Sep 1, 2007","san francisco is regularly inundated with tourists. this review is for you. oh, and i shouldn't forget the locals who never ride BART except to take the train to baseball games.. this is for you as well.getting around on BART is easy to figure out. it is a train which travels on a rail in one direction and another direction (usually the opposite one) on the other rail. these rails are defined on a color-coded map which should look familiar to anyone from new york, london, chicago, atlanta, or any other city with subways. it's not even as labrynthine as it first appears - there are only four end destinations and five total routes. here's how to read this contraption. first, find your location/station on the map (here's a hint - there are signs absolutely everywhere in the station telling you the answer to this). now, find your destination on the map (no, ""san francisco"" is not a single destination). now comes the part you connect the two. if the line is blue, you'll be catching a dublin/pleasanton train or san francisco/millbrae train depending on which way you'd like to go. transfers are easy to figure out as well with the use of the map, some basic logic, and/or by listening to the train operator - because they announce details like that.ok, so congratulations on picking your route. now, there's a train coming. but where is it going? is it going your way? holy crap! this is where you freak out and ask everyone in the line or doorway, ""does this train go to san francisco!?"" well, all you really had to do was read the large-print, bright red LED signs above you because they tell you exactly where the train's end destination is. also, there's that pre-recorded voice announcing the destination of the train which may confuse some..phew! you are on the train you wanted - you know this because you interrupted two businessmen who were busy doing something important on their laptops. ""now what? there aren't any available seats!"" well, here's your chance to practice your balance - this is always more fun after a night of drinking. i suggest, if you've never ridden BART, to hold on to the disgusting, unsanitized rails above you, or near the door. this ride isn't smooth. now, if you fear you've lost the comfort and security of that map you saw at the station and are now lost in the BART system forever, do not fret. there is one mounted near every door. the fun part here is to stare at it, point, and make observations of what is around each station loud enough so the locals can take notes on this information.general things to know when riding BART:1) the larger seats by the doors are for elderly or disabled people, by law. if you do not give up your seat for an elderly person and you're a young twenty-something, be prepared to be harassed by the liberal denizens of the bay area. hopefully you feel like the jerk you are. also, if you are male, you are required by tightly held codes of honor to give your seat up to any female who may be standing near you. this, however, is not required by law.2) do not hold the doors open if they are closing on you. BART trains already run on some haphazard schedule that no one follows, so don't make it worse. also, these doors are stronger than you'd think and might take your arm off.3) most people are friendly around these parts. they'll answer some questions you may have, or carry on a conversation if they look like the type to talk, but that doesn't mean we want to hear you yelling into your cellphone about how you have been to many restaurants and still not seen the ""san francisco treat"" of rice-a-roni on any menu. we also don't want to hear your ipod.4) bikes are allowed on BART, much to the chagrin of bike-unfriendlies. do not feel bad if you have a bike (within the specifically allocated bike hours, of course). you're just smarter than those who don't.5) i wish the panhandlers would read this because this is where i'd tell them to stop telling us their repetitive sob stories, annoying people for money.6) and, finally, this one deserves capslock.. on the escalators, STAND ON THE RIGHT, WALK ON THE LEFT. it's not written in stone, people, but it's common sense.if you have further questions, or want to study the maps beforehand, refer to http://www.bart.gov. please note that, on 99% of the year, BART stops running around midnight, so plan accordingly."
909,3,"Oct 18, 2008","It's difficult to accurately rate BART as a whole.  On the one hand, it's a relatively easy, convenient, and quick way to get around particular parts of the Bay Area.  It's also relatively clean, especially when you consider the fact that its seats are cloth and its floors are mostly carpeted.  On the other hand, BART is way too expensive for daily or even regular commuting.  They do offer combination BART-Muni passes and so-called ""high-value"" cards, but I don't consider saving only 6.25 percent a particularly good value, especially when I cannot buy these cards at every BART station.  Also, since you're probably going to have to add some money to use the card a final time, you end up losing some of that measly 6.25 percent.  And I'm not even mentioning the ripoff that is paying $3 extra to get from BART to Oakland International Airport.  (Thanks for making us pay for your poor planning!)In the end, I do like BART.  I mostly use it to get from San Francisco to SFO and to commute to Berkeley when I have seasonal work there.  So for me, BART serves its purpose.  But BART can be pretty annoying to get to if you live in the western part of San Francisco, and the extent of its Bay Area coverage is pretty limited, although I guess they're going through with taking it all the way down to San Jose.Strangely, I find BART the most efficient during rush hour, which I cannot say for Muni or any other major public-transportation system I have used regularly."
910,1,"Aug 16, 2006","BART deserves no stars:for those who gave it more than one why?let's begin:1) BART is way over-priced; in Chicago i take CTA from ORD to downtown - cost $1.50 - same distance in the Bay Area - at least $5.00+; I pay several thousand of dollars per year to use this system-- in a comparable transit system I would pay just a fraction of that2) Software ""updates"" always have snafu's-- the system shuts down and your stuck for an indeterminate period of time3) BART station agents: usually rude; I am rarely understood even asking the simplest of questions; BART related questions seem to tax them too much4) BART tickets de-mag easily-- if you think about them de-magniticizing they de-magniticize5) BART refunding on de-mag tickets; go to some obscure office open only when you work in downtown Oakland somewhere; and their customer service section at Lake Merritt cannot help with de-mag tickets; they say a de-mag ticket is not a customer service problem??6) I never look at the schedule because i don't think BART ever follows it.7) BART passengers; if I had a dollar for everytime i have been hit in the head while seated I would be quite wealthy hence not taking BART ever agan; somehow it is okay to hit a passenger in the head with a purse, case, backpack etc.  other transit system i have visited -- i have experienced fellow passengers for stepping on your foot or bumping into you--not a BART passenger8) Passengers putting their feet on a seat9) Passengers refusing to move their packs when another passenger wants to sit!  hmmm in other transit systems-- that is called a ticket!10) BART passengers blocking the left side of the escalator11) BART not having signage asking passengers on escalators to move to their left12) BART can only speak in English-- all train signs are ony in English-- yet there is a Thank you sign in many languages-- a bit inconsistent; how about visitors who use the system?13) BART placing stickers on trains saying it won the best transit system in America??? hmmm well given the lack of public transport system-- seems like anyone could win this aware.   and such self-congratulatory messaging -- i am not sure what that does for me or anyone using the system?"
911,4,"Jul 8, 2006","Hey, it's public transportation- the public is dirty. That being said, if you ignore the weirdo's who always seam to sit across from me and want to show off their lack of clothing beneath that newspaper- it is safe and convenient, and who doesn't enjoy a good show? No metering lights, and you can be way over the leagal limit and still get around. My only question is, the bars are open till 2;00, why does Bart stop at midnight? Where's MADD when you need them?"
914,2,"Jun 6, 2007","FUCK!!! When I moved to the US from Australia, I was forced to start my hate affair with BART.  Sure, it is a less expensive way to get to work than driving but, Christ, it makes me really hate people.  Not a good thing considering I am already challenged in this area. Don't get me wrong, I love my fellow man - I just don't like the stupid, gross, rude, ignorant ones with no sense of personal space. It always amazes me how they just keep pushing, like a herd of sheep trying to get to the food trough, when it's quite obvious that the train is full. I have found a solution to this, however. I dig my little Taurus heels in and I refuse to budge. Sure. Push away. I ain't moving.  So far, it has proved quite effective. I also wait a while for trains. I'd rather wait for 10 minutes than stand next to some weird stranger with a skin disease. It certainly is an education in the awfulness of the human race.I am also SO TIRED of people feeling that's its okay to fart right next to me, sneeze on me or cough on me. If any of you farting, sneezing, coughing types are reading this STOP IT OR I'M GOING TO SEND THE DEMONS OF THE GOETIA AFTER YOU. Seriously. Please acquire some manners. My Mum would be horrified (my mum is very proper) if she heard me on BART. I've taken to yelling at people now (well, yelling as much as my gentle Pig nature will allow me) when they are rude or stupid. Unfortunately, I don't think its working. Sigh. However, I'm stuck without it so I guess I'll  just have to endure. Thank Baphomet for my ipod and a good book."
915,2,"Jul 9, 2008","Mr Chao thinks BART stands for what happens when you ride on it- ""Bah! Aurgh! Really Tardy!""  Mr Chao thinks the trains on BART are very filthy and old.   Mr Chao has used public transit around the world and has realized that BART, while great in theory, simply is behind the times and doesn't execute public transport nearly as well as other cities/states/countries.  Mr Chao also cannot figure out why the BART doesn't run late at night...so that he can go drinking and get a ride home.  Even if Mr Chao has to wait 30 min, no driving is a big perk.Mr Chao simply finds little or no utility with bart anymore except to go to the airport now."
916,2,"Jan 17, 2011","I've been in a lot of public transit vehicles, and none disappoint me more than that stinky train BART.First, I ride a bike. Oh no!! Look out grouchy old people & easily offended workaholics! I choose to ride a bike, because I do not want to have to take up two seats when I sit down & I think breathing cleaner air is important. I do not ride a bike to be harassed or scowled at while trying to get where I need to. Aren't there kiosks in the BART station asking people to ride their bikes to work more? Hmmm...how would I do that comfortably on your trains BART? CALTrain seems to have a whole train car devoted to their bike riding patrons. Should CALTrain ever dominate your tracks as the Bay Area transportation scheme gets bigger, I will advocate on behalf of my bicycling brothers & sisters to get their model approved for the expansion.Second, clean your cars. I know that BART is an underground housing shelter for the less fortunate...but when it rains, and you have fabric seats, AND carpet(which you are now getting to replacing with non-skid surface - 12 years later), the smell of mold & rot is somewhat unbearable. Why rely on chemical warfare to do the job your trains are already doing? My favorite is a regular commuter I would see, would floss his teeth for the entire 20 minutes he rode - flicking oral debris everywhere. I once saw a group of young men patting hard down on a group of seat cushions, which caused a huge plume of broken-down foam dust(with skin tabs, hair, fart dust, and God knows what else) to be released into the air. Their intent was to cover their friend's food with this dust. So, people eat on BART... When was the last time a citation was given to an eater? I see more drunk people on BART during game season than I do in SF bars!!! Seriously?! Tear down those decals that tell us where a train is serviced...instead have the folks who recycle materials to pull their carts onto BART to remove the waste your union paid workers seem to have a problem doing themselves.Finally, we come to service. I do respect the drivers & technicians you have working your trains. They are courteous, informative, & your backbone. Treat them well, because they are all you have going good for you. You should also treat your station agents better. They are in need of more help, since their attitudes are not always friendly. More help does not mean more people...because lets face it, I've had to wait for some to finish their personal conversations before I see a line go down. Give power back to the rider. Put out more information to them so that the station agent doesn't have to do every little thing. They work hard long days & nights...and some of your patrons on BART are less than well behaved. Your staff at the top have also got to figure out the BART police scenario too. Top execs collect a big enough paycheck, and THAT means you should know how to train your officers to do their job AND review them on a regular basis. There is no reason anyone should die while using your moderate priced transportation.I hope this single opinion shows how I have now come to rely on a bike or a personal vehicle to make my Bay Area travels happen instead of using BART. I hope you integrate changes soon."
917,1,"Jan 6, 2009","SHAME ON YOU BART!I am deeply saddened to hear about the situation at the Fruitvale station.  My heart goes out to the family of that young man whom BART police SHOT IN THE BACK!!!!  How could you treat someone like that????Linton Johnson (BART spokesman)...how dare you allow the Bay Area Racist Transit to ""USE"" (yes, I said ""USE"") your face to communicate that such a barbaric act was anything less than barbaric?  A ""real man"" would have resigned before he let the Bay Area Racist Transit ""use"" him.BART you have been a pain in the ass for many years...striking for no reason other than greed.  You never gave a crap about the public and now everyone knows.

918,3,"Apr 24, 2017","My first time.We took BoltBus from Los Angeles to BART's West Oakland Stn. and from there took BART to Downtown Berkeley to visit UC Berkeley for their Cal Day.For those unfamiliar with BART [Bay Area Rapid Transit] like we were, I have a few tips.From the West Oakland Stn. to their Downtown Berkeley Stn., the actual travel time is about 12 minutes.  However, don't forget to add the waiting time, which varies depending on when you arrive and the metro trains' schedule.   Although BART says in their booklet that they operate from 6 am to midnight, we learned that not all of their lines are operating during this entire time period or every day of the week.  Which meant we had to exit at their MacArthur Stn. to transfer onto another train line to reach our final destination.  This means more time is required for those planning on a tight scheduled.  The BART attendant can assist you if needed.The cost for our particular BART trip was $2 per person/one way.  The fees are posted on the wall near the ticket vending machines.  My wife, daughter, and I all bought our own ticket with $2 cash each.  Each traveler must have their own ticket.  You need these tickets to enter the train's departure platform and also again to exit the arrival platform of your destination, so don't discard or misplace them.  [When you've arrived at your final - paid for - destination, the automated turnstile kept our ticket after it was inserted.]Having exact change to deposit is preferable, but if unable, the machine does dispense change.  The posted instructions could have been written better on this subject, but weren't, which caused frustration and wasted more time trying to figure things out.  On our return trip, our smallest bill was $10.  The machine has a button to press for ""Multiple tickets"" [and then it tries to guess what you need].  It first assumed we wanted 2 tickets and wanted to load $5 per ticket.  Wrong.  So, we had to press another button to tell it we wanted 3 tickets [which the machine then automatically loaded $3.xx per ticket].  Wrong again.  The machine has a button to ""Subtract $1"" and another to ""Subtract 5 cents"".  Neither sum or choice was the correct change for our intended purchase.  With no other obvious option, we pressed the button to ""Cancel"".  After several tries with the same result, we complained to the lone BART attendant in the booth and he came to our rescue.Here's the secret to solve the dilemma.  After telling the machine you wanted more tickets [in our case, a total of 3], to get the correct change, you press the ""Subtract $1"" button to go from auto-loaded $3.30/ticket to $2.30/ticket.  Then, keep pressing the ""Subtract 5 cents"" button until it goes from $2.30/ticket down to $2.00/ticket.  Then, let the machine know you're done and it will return $4.00.  Paper money [$1 bills] were not dispensed as change.  The vending machine returns your change in coins.  [I wasn't looking forward to getting $4 in nickels and was worried when I only heard 4 coins drop.  It turned out to be four rarely used, but well-worn out $1 coins.]The BART system is convenient, but showing its age.  The public restrooms were reportedly gross per my wife and daughter.  Depending on which station you used and the social-economic level of its users and neighborhood, they probably have varying levels of cleanliness.Don't stand too close to the edge of the platform for safety reasons and never turn your back to strangers.  As reported on the news, there are psychos out there that shove unsuspecting patrons onto the tracks.  It may not have happened on BART yet, but it does occur.Be safe, avoid traveling alone if possible, and take care of yourself."
919,2,"Feb 5, 2012",Dirtier than it used to be and it just plain sucks to pay $8.10 from the airport to the Embarcadero. RACKET!

Though i think it SUCKS that i cant bring my bike on BART until like 9am. Jerks. So there is this Orange van that im in love with (no, not the one the creepy guy from your neighborhood used to cruise in) that has a bike trailer, and for a mere buck, will take you from Macarthur to The Greyhound Bus thing in SF. Im actually giving the four stars to Orange Van. There is a drawback, and thats the music. Sorry Reese, but if youre anything like me, bumping gangsta rap at 7am is not on the menu. Well, usually never is, but 7am im not nearly drunk enough to pretend to like it. So bring the phones."
921,5,"Nov 26, 2012","BART is undoubtedly the sexiest rail transit system on the West Coast.  It is a heavy rail intercity system, so it's significantly faster than light rail systems and features modestly retro sci-fi set-like stations (if you look carefully).  A great thing about riding BART is that you can relax or think about other things without worrying about all the impatient dimwits on the freeways or Bay Bridge.  With the congestion on Bay Area freeways, BART is faster in certain circumstances and can be generally relied upon to always take about the same amount of time.  Personally, I find BART to be a less stressful and hassle-ridden way to get from the East Bay to SF than negotiating the heavily impacted MacArthur Maze.  It's also nice to only have to pay a few bucks for transit fare and not have to hunt for and then lose an arm and leg to parking fees in SF.  Think of it as packing lighter for more freedom of mind.  I find that people complain excessively about the cloth seats and carpet.  Here are some thoughts:1) They aren't that dirty.  Stained?  Yes.  But are you planning on eating dinner or licking the seats?  Do you scrub your gums with them?  If you do so frequently, I'd cut it out because it's against the rules and defies common sense.  Otherwise, they aren't that big of a deal, warmer in fact, than the new vinyl seats they're installing.2) The vinyl seat ""solution.""  Firstly, yes, the vinyl seat covers can be ""cleaned easier"" if needed.  But do you really think that they're going to wipe the seats down every night if nothing has been spilled?  Probably not.  In exchange for a psychological improvement for the thin skinned folks who apparently have imaginary HIV, we get a clammier feeling seat that holds all the scary bacteria closer to the surface than on the cloth seats and a slightly louder interior.3) Regarding the carpet, it is also stained, but again, do you really want to trade a quieter interior for a grimy new linoleum floor?  The carpet may get ugly fast, but for me, a layer of cloth that absorbs some of the budget-cut induced rail screech is preferable to aesthetic ""perfection.""4) For those rude and condescending people complaining about ""bums,"" get a life.  Have they ever heard of the Golden Rule?  Treat others as you want to be treated?  The condescending person might not feel so hot when a different band of people considers that person human trash or something else contemptible.Sigh...Anyway, if you feel like using a fast, modern, and relaxing alternative to dealing with all the congestion on the freeways or the city streets in SF, I'd strongly recommend trying BART."
922,2,"May 4, 2012","Well, the stations are loaded with assorted 2-legged pigs in S.F.  They sleep there and drop deuces in the common areas.  Dis-gooosting!  The trains are old, crappy and smelly and so are some of the passengers."
923,1,"Feb 11, 2015","BART is almost always late, whether it be from mechanical issues to the almost daily ""medical emergency"". The BART union has created this mess, diverting money to their overfed bellies rather than focusing on improvements to trains and stations. As a result we have overcrowded, smelly & behind-schedule trains. I can't recall the last time I actually sat down during a commute day (not that I'd actually want to, but at least the seats aren't cloth anymore, YUCK)."
926,3,"Apr 2, 2013","I have a love/hate relationship with the BART. I commute each weekday from the East Bay into San Francisco and I've experienced a wide range of service from clean & worry free commuting all the way to stinky/dirty & unreliable service.  I've seen people get up and offer their seats to elderly people and I've also seen homeless people passed out lying in their urine and vomit.   I've seen people leave packed cars so that others can get out at stops and also I've seen cyclists jam their way into rush hour packed cars and then block the doors so that people can't get out at their stops.  I've listened to amazing street musicians playing in the downtown stations and purchased their CD's and I've also donated coins to homeless families begging with their children.   I've sat in newly renovated seats and I've also mistakenly sat and put my hand in something left behind by a previous passenger that had not been cleaned.   I've been in trains that were on time, I've been delayed in crowded trains the trans bay tube for up to 40 minutes (unsettling at best).  I've seen posters cheerfully advertising $150,000 in salary for open BART Police job positions and then witnessed the glazed over look in the eyes of BART Police Officers telling me that no salary is worth the price that they pay for their jobs.  At the end of the day I can say that I take BART because it's there and it's a better option for me than driving, however, BART's far from perfect and I wish they would spend more attention to cleanliness, reliability, the riding experience, parking, safety,  and cost."
927,3,"Jan 8, 2014","With a bicycle, massive quads, and dauntless patience  a car free existence is totally doable in the Bay Area Thanks to BART and other public transit providers.  Pros:--getting to SFO has never been cheaper or easier. The beer can on a rope to OAK is up and running as well... Crappy traffic will not make you miss your flight. --Reasonably punctual. --is cheaper than gas and insurance.--Less stressful than driving or riding--Great place for people watching.--With the introduction of the Clipper card you can get in and our of the station without fussing with the terrible ticket machines or worrying that your card will be demagnetized. A Clipper card is essential to your happiness if you ride BART often.--You always have an excuse to leave the bar. The train stops running around midnight. --Fewer panhandlers than other major citiesCons:-You never can remain at the bar until closing time--No public restrooms in any underground station.  This really stinks literally because our transient community has taken to using stairwells and elevators as toilets instead. It stinks figuratively because you also cannot use the toilet. Your children cannot use the toilet.  It's a major inconvenience. --most of the stations are poorly maintained and filthy--most of the famously well compensated ticket agents are not skilled in customer relations--the maps and signage are outdated and unclear,  even knowing which platform to stand on to catch the right train  is unclear.  It's not tourist friendly."

I rode the subway for 7 years in Boston and nobody ever touched me (on purpose)--compared to most other cities subways (NY, Bos, Chi, DC) it serves only a small area of the city and leaves out a lot of important tourist destinations like the GG bridge --Its really expensive compared to other cities public transit: one-way is $4+ compared to $2 in a lot of other cities.  I guess BART goes farther distance-wise but still--Terribly inconvenient to get to the airport.   Millbrae BART and SFO are literally across the street from each other, but to get from Millbrae station to SFO station on BART you have to take not one but TWO trains!  Ridiculous!  And you have to take a Caltrain to Millbrae if you're in peninsula/south bay.  --You can't get a monthly BART pass, which is really annoying--Its really really noisy compared to other subway systems I've been onI just feel like BART really needs to make up its mind if it wants to be a commuter rail that connects SF to all the surrounding cities, like the East Bay & South Bay or if it wants to be a local subway system for the city of SF.   Right now its a really awkward mixture of both, and it doesn't do either well at all."

Not only is BART a dirty, dirty whore, but like my ex gf, BART gives everybody a ride.  If BART was willing to whore itself in other areas of SF like sunset, richmond, pac heights, etc.., then BART would be a more efficient and better suited for the city.  Having a slutty BART around town would allow easy access and convience for the residents in the heart of SF.  Either way BART is still a filthy slut that needs to be pimped slapped into a classy ho."

When I finally arrived & got off at SoSF Sta., I tried to use the bathroom but it was locked. It was only 11:30pm, so I asked the Station Attendant why the bathrooms are closed early and whether there are new policies about the bathrooms.  We have used the bathrooms when we come late from the City and so were very surprised that they are now locked.  She told me that BART is a Public Transit System and BART has the option to NOT have the bathrooms available at anytime but if I really have to go she can open the bathroom for me.  I believe the Station Attendant is just LAZY and not following procedures to allow the public access to BART bathrooms.  I don't see any reason why I need to plea to a Station Attendant every time I have to use a bathroom."

935,3,"Dec 30, 2007","I remember the first time I rode BART.  I lived in Walnut Creek and took the train into the city.  It was around lunchtime and the car was clean and almost empty.  We spent a few hours in town and went home.  Same clean car and we had our choice of seats.  I was amazed.  Then I moved to SF and began to rely on BART every day/night.  The stations became not so clean and the patrons not so sparce (or clean).  I've seen plenty enough to never ride the train again but the only other option is taking MUNI and that's another review.  For the most part BART is on time,  clean enough to stand up in,  and if you mind your own business - safe.  I learned the hard way a FEW TIMES that BART isn'tt open late.  And I have been short a few times and the attendants were cooperative;  not that they would leave their fortresses to chase down a jumper.  The homeless like to camp out in the stations which is fine with me;  better than being out in the cold and I've tossed a few dollars to some of the entertainers there.  The cars get way too crowded during peak times however and more than a few times I've given up my seat for an elderly person only to watch a teenager plop their sorry ass down.  Kudos to the elderly lady one night who confronted two teens when they left their forty oz bottles in the floor when exiting.  Probably a good thing you guys just shut your mouths and got off."
936,2,"Jan 4, 2017",Just wondering if BART will ever improve service. Either an increase in frequency of arrival or trains with more holding space/seats. I pay on average $9 a day for Bart alone (because downtown SF ticket machines don't accept my transit benefit credit card). I'm sure those commuting to/from Concord pay even more. Why is this service so shitty? Why so many delays or dangerously over crowded trains?

It's dirty (though I do appreciate that they are changing out the vomit covered carpets for washable flooring). The cool part is that it gets SF folks without cars over to Oakland, Berkeley and Daly City. My #1 complaint though is that it doesn't run 24hrs. UNREAL! What a waste. It's clear to me that BART is purely to make money off people who live way out in the berbs coming to work in SF during the regular 9-5 shifts. They do nothing for SF residents who can only get to a couple of neighborhoods. And they do nothing to keep the people of the bay area safe at night by providing an alternative to drunk driving to and from the east bay. If BART ran 24hrs/day (even at a limited night schedule) I would forgive all other follies.

941,3,"Nov 8, 2015","BART is incredible (for west coast public transportation).  It is very good a certain things - getting you from downtown Oakland to downtown SF and back, getting you to OAK or SFO without spending mad $$$ or getting crippled in traffic, and staying on schedule.  There are many things, however, which need to be fixed, and can be achieved without billions of dollars.  The cars need to have more doors and less seats.  The service needs to be expanded.  Now I'm not saying we need NYC or Chicago style 24-hour service.  All I'm saying is Boston or DC style, run a bit later and start a bit earlier.  Also, I don't get the focus on extending BART deeper into the burbs.  People who live so far away clearly aren't dying for the city life.  Now while I'm all about expansion to the burbs, an easier, and much more needed fix, is infill stations.  You don't have to build new tracks or imminent domain miles and miles of property.  All you have to do is plunk down a few stations between existing ones.  You gotta have 1 in Albany.  You gotta have 1 in Jack London, after West Oakland, but before going underground.  You can have a few more between Lake Merrit and San Leandro.  Having only Fruitvale and Coliseum during that stretch is a joke.  In SF they need a bunch more too.  Step it up BART!"

Last Thursday (5/15) I had the most HORRIFIC experience to date, well actually, if you give me some time, I'm sure I could come up with 3 more similar instances.  First of all, I knew there was trouble when I went down to Embarcadero station and the ENTIRE platform was flooded with people.  Also, there was a Fremont train with all doors open, and people packed to the brim, with others standing outside realizing they have to wait until another train comes their way.  I KNEW I had to just get out of the station.  It was about 5:15pm, and I boarded the on coming Dublin/Pleasanton train....it was FOUR CARS!!  WTF!!!  So again, everyone packed it in like sardines (with leaving people on the platform that couldn't fit).  The train went TURTLE SLOW.  Realizing that every platform was pouring with people, I off boarded at Bayfair Station to catch a Fremont train.  Again, the platform was FULL.  You would think that a breeze through the station would easily push 5-10 people to their death - or maybe they would be considered lucky for they would no longer be on the platform with 1,000 people.  I boarded the Fremont train, and as the train got to South Hayward, the operator said that someone had FAINTED on the train.  There would be another Fremont train coming on the other side of the platform and gave the riders 2 minutes to DART out of the train RUN ACROSS to the other side of the platform and BOARD ANOTHER TRAIN.  WTF?!?!  It was such a PATHETIC commute that there were even people clapping as we reached the Fremont Station.  I bet they were clapping for 3 reasons: 1. Couldn't believe they made it to their destination; 2. Couldn't believe they didn't need to TRANSFER to yet ANOTHER train; and3. They probably don't ride Bart on a regular basis and wanted to ""rub it in"" to those of us that do.As a consumer, when you are not satisfied with a service, in good faith the service provider gives you a DISCOUNT or REFUND for the awful service.  It just boggles my mind, especially when I travel internationally and experience the AMAZING metro transit rail system in other countries (timely, CLEAN, pleasant)....Bart is pretty below standard."

Went back for a high school reunion and saved $200 on my plane ticket by flying into Oakland, so I gladly sprang the $3.59 for BART. It was a very convenient connection both ways, and I'd definitely do it again."
954,4,"Jun 12, 2005","as a daily BART commuter i certainly have a lot of opinions about it.  it certainly does the job getting me back and forth from my apartment in the city to my job in berkeley and for that it is to be commended.  its existence prevents me the ugly necessity of owning a car.  i have also taken it to both SFO and OAK many times which certainly saves me money while costing me some time (but since i have more time than money its a good deal).  i have visited every single BART station and they are for the most part extremely clean and some of them are pretty cool looking as well.  if you like, head on over to http://cryoem.berkeley.edu/~egalburt/bart.htm to navigate vBART and check out my pics of each station.     while people complain about service, i think that more people need to use BART in order for it to make sense to add more trains.  however, they do seem to continually raise prices while the amount of service continues to decline... lastly, although probably too late to change unless we want even more price hikes, the choice to use cloth seats and flooring is a mysterious one at best.     anyway, congratulations to BART for being america's number one transit system...whatever the f that means."

The other stations were fine but this particular station, it ruined my experience. One of the employees at the information window disrespected me from the get go. I put money on one of my Bart Cards that i had previously used. I used my debit card and got my receipt. My gf was like you dont need the receipt right and tossed it away. I found no harm in that. So i tried to get through and it gave me an error after a few tries. So i went to the window and i didn't even say a word and she gave me attitude right from the get go.

The trains are ALWAYS packed during rush hour (solution: more trains!) The trains are FILTHY (solution: go for NY's subway option, use plastic or whatever the material they use for seats instead). For SF State to do a study on the germs, fecal bacteria and skin borne diseases found in the chairs BART could use the increase in fare to revamp the interiors. It's expensive - from Dublin to Montgomery you're looking at $11.30 round trip; that's $56.50 per week. $226/month, or 2700+ per year! To top it off, most stations that offer parking charge for parking in their lots. It's constantly HOT in train and train stations.The good things: it gets you from point A to point B (eventually) and it covers a fair amount of the bay area --- well that is if you don't count the Santa Clara/San Jose South Bay part of the Bay Area. They accept Clipper which is convenient."

With your new price increases it costs me more to go the the airport than to go down to San Jose via Caltrain.  Looks like now when I go to fly out of town I will spring the extra couple bucks and take a shuttle.  Sorry Bart...I think you lost a rider."
965,4,"Feb 2, 2009",Bart...I like you when I have to take you.  I definetly like you more in the city and south.  You get a little too confusing/annoying in the eastbay.  Great for the airport though.  Prices seem fair and I've never not felt safe.
966,3,"Jun 11, 2009","Ever since I left my job in San Francisco and started working in the East Bay, BART has been my way of getting to work. I've gotten used getting there and having the train be pretty on time. It really doesn't lie about times except maybe by a minute or two. I just don't like it when they leave just as you arrive at the door and there's nothing you can do except watch the train go by and wait another 15 minutes during the commute hours. What I am not a fan of is/are people getting on to the train and pleading their sad story/sob story. I've been on a train where there was a regular asking for money for medication. They don't have enough for the month, etc. Then they get a phone call and break out their cell phone. Yeah right they're on a fixed income etc.The other was recently where a guy got on and said, ""Can anyone spart $6.00 so I can get a breakfast meal at Burgar King?"" OK, $6.00 for a breakfast? Where does he think he is? So this lady gives him $1.00 so he needs five more. He then goes to the other end of the train pleading for $6.00. HELLO!? If you asked if anyone could spare some change and or $1.00 you're more likely to get that then the $6.00 you're asking for. Damn, if you're going to pan-handle on the damn trains at least ask for a reasonable amount. Geez. You're not bright and obviously if you're asking for $6.00 it's probably for beer or something. My other gripe is when there's someone REALLY REALLY smelly on the train. OMG! The whole car REEKS of that guy! Can someone please do something about that?Since BART has taken out some of the carpeting in cars it's been more pleasant to ride. The new floors are less likely to smell like urine which is a big plus. Now if they could only change their seats to something other than cloth...When a car had no air going in and is boiling hot and there's a person that smells that's when I have to change cars. I'm sorry, but a warm car with a smell is enough to make me sick. If it's just warm I can fall right asleep. Except when there's some guy that stands right next to me as I'm trying to sleep asking for money.Don't scare me while I'm about to sleep. And please don't stand next to me if you smell. BART is a nice transportation to get me to and from, but all other bus systems need to learn from MUNI. MUNI is still better than AC Transit any day of the week."
967,2,"Jan 2, 2019","Started with a New Years 2019 BART trip to San Francisco from the Eastbay, not a disappointment.  The trains had plenty of available seats, after all it was before noon and many people were home recovering from their celebrations of the night before.  The train was of course with the usual suspects; one sleeping passenger on a seat looking like he had been there for several hours; another passenger with no shirt walking down the aisle with his pants literally falling down and he clearly had wet himself (just what I wanted to see); then the one goon who played his rap music so everyone in the car could listen to the m..f.. lyrics that are so welcome by all; and then the jerks that come onto the train sizing-up the other passengers and try to look threatening just standing there never taking a seat. Getting off at the Civic Center Station presented several misfits who were going-up to those waiting asking for a dollar.  They clearly were there to pander and annoy paying passengers.  How did they get down to the platform, they for sure didn't pay to get through the gates. Would have been nice to see a uniformed BART officer attending to some business along the way, but again never saw one. I know they are pressed, but really they could go through these areas frequently and make a positive difference.  The kiosk attendants should be monitoring the cameras on the platform and get security there and perhaps fewer of these misfits would be hanging around harassing paying passengers.  Just a few thoughts, beware as you travel the rails on BART."

Only reason they lost a star is because they shut down at midnight with the last train running at like 12:50. They should at least keep it running until 2:30 for the drunken peeps to get home if they're across the bay. Either way thanks for the all the rides you've given me bart."

A few times that I have been on BART, the system is effective; its usually on schedule, reasonably clean, reasonably priced, and staffed with accommodating employees.  THIS IS A PUBLIC TRANSIT (not a limo service) and the price they charge for the ride and service is very reasonable."

Three fatal shootings in three years.NYC Transit Police: 2,400 officers, no fatal shootings in the last ten years.Caltrain: 6 officers. No fatal shootings, ever.Why does BART need such a huge, aggressive police presence... and their own SWAT team, armed with automatic rifles? Do they intend to use those rifles on a crowded platform, or inside of trains?They have more officers per rider than NYC, by a large margin... which means that an average rider pays about 50 cents more each way to pay for salaries, training, etc. They were designed to be a completely automated transit system, with cars arriving every two minutes... instead, they are a huge, self-perpetuating bureaucracy. Willie Brown was right... they're transit police. They should have tasers, not guns."

Cloth seats, screaching metal on metal sounds between the stops in the mission, not the fastest, definitely not the cheapest (don't get me started on this one...my rating will most certainly start going down), not the cleanest, not the most comprehensive in terms of stops and coverage, but all in all, you will get to your destination....eventually. And hey, you can go under the bay. How cool is that? It's pretty damn cool.But what the hell is up with the tickets? I had a bunch of old tickets with 30-75 cents, ALL of which had been ""unreadable"". What the hell? Then I read some signs in the box window which directed against placing the tickets near cell phones or credit cards or change. Um, either someone here is way ahead in their technology. Or behind. I'm guessing it's the latter. And for how much money is actually going on those tickets to travel just a couple of miles, by now they should be equipped with a chip that allows us to connect to the internet so we can surf the web or they should act as xray vision goggles or they should be able to self destruct in 5 seconds like this review should have done 100 words ago."

How if you are stranded in the transbay tunnel, or in the subway, you should cross through to the adjacent tunnel to await the rescue train?

RUN---DON'T WALK----OUT OF THE TUBE IN A CATASTROPHE.  And just in case they do come, don't run down the MIDDLE of the tracks.As I hurtle through the subway with that unmistakable BART sound screeching in my ears, with a train full of perfect strangers, my mind starts racing about the situations that would cause such an evacuation; and of course, I think about some kind of tremendously powerful and horrifyingly destructive earthquake that shakes the living shit out of everything, and destabilizes the transbay tube...of course, it would happen on the day I finally overcome agoraphobia, and decide to check out downtown Oakland....how freaky it would be to climb out of the train in the tunnel, as it begins to leak....pitch blackness, as the lights have failed, and all of us passengers trying to light the way with cellphones and iPods...the cities of Oakland and San Francisco engulfed in turmoil, death, and destruction...fires erupting everywhere from all the gas lines in all the cities around the bay....we would SO be on our own.....the illustration gives me the chills.But I digress...There is no excuse to shut down BART service at midnight or one AM...that's just silly and embarrassing.  The trains should run 24 hours, and during the wee hours of the morning, perhaps just one or two an hour.And babies, LOSE that nasty upholstery, and carpeting, and replace it PLEASE with something that can be wiped-clean.

The irony of BART is that it encourages driving, i.e. cars are good, BART bad.Case in point: - It is not possible to get to SFO on a Sunday/Holiday before 9:05AM via BART, which runs $8+ dollars one-way from most San Francisco stops.- However, it IS possible to get to SFO from Millbrae by 8:07AM. ($4.05 one-way fare)Do people not go to the airport on Sunday mornings? Is BART trying to divert people to park in the shiny Millbrae parking structure?

985,2,"Feb 25, 2016","My biggest complaints with BART are: inconsistency, safety and it's just plain dirty.  While I understand a public transit agency cannot stop anyone from using the system, it doesn't feel safe, especially if you are using it during non-commute times.  There are a lot of homeless and crazies that move from car to car and train to train.  I saw a man sitting in a seat who was accosted by a crazy walking through the train.  BART does nothing (and I mean NOTHING) to make patrons feel safe; they have dummy security cameras in the majority of their cars!  BART has a ""schedule-smedule"" attitude; they don't run on time, are frequently 20+ minutes delayed and don't apologize.  The trains are pretty filthy; I don't know if they are ever cleaned.  BART also holds the entire Bay Area hostage every 3-4 years when the train operators union contract is being negotiated. During the last strike, I had to use AC Transit; the commute experience was radically different and I crossed over the to the Light Side.  Now, I only take BART when I have to (which fortunately is not very often).  Other major cities have larger systems and fewer problems.  Also, get rid of those ridiculous paper tickets that are useless if a drop of water touches them."

I ride the BART almost everyday for work, from Daly City to 16th st Mission.  What do you mean Daly City isn't part of SF?  It is here I moved unknowingly on a whim, regardless of the consequences (thankfully the lease is up in a month), and was aghast to find that there is NO MONTHLY BENEFIT FROM RIDING PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION.  I mean seriously, what the fuck?  (Oh wait there is, but unfortunately it starts at Glen Park.... Thanks!)Nobody, wants to ride public transportation, they do it because they have to.  BART is by far the most expensive public transportation I have come across out of these three major cities I have called my home.

It's convenient, and generally punctual, but after years of dealing with mysteriously disappearing MUNI buses, I think my public transit standards are at an all time low.

It falls far short of perfection for transporting people all throughout the Bay Area. I used to think BART was great. then I took the subways in Stockholm. Greatest public transit on earth. Missed a train at 1am and there was another in 5 MINUTES! The Swedes know what serving the public is about. Barcelona has better subway service than BART. Amsterdam, Lisbon, Vancouver...Do BART officials ever take notes from other major cities? Oh I forgot, in America we don't fund shit, so I can't blame BART officials. When will BART stop using cloth covered seats? All kinds of who knows what is soiled in these seats. If you don't live near BART, it's a pain. to get there. By the time you drive/bike to the station, you might as well have driven/biked to your destination. Fares are always going up with mediocre service. How many times are you stuck and they don't tell you what the delay is about? In BART's defense, they don't have the advantage of developing with the growth of the metropolis. California was built around cars, and BART had to fit in. Why oh why didn't the good people of San Mateo county vote to have BART service back in the late 1960's? I'm seriously babbling..."
1006,5,"Feb 8, 2009","I pretty much like BART . It's very convenient , reliable , and almost always on time . I go to City College so BART is nice for me . I can get from downtown to school or from school to downtown in around 15 minutes . Much faster than the Metro or the bus . It's also nice how I can use my monthly Adult Muni Fast Pass to take BART to school everyday for no additional cost . I just HATE how the fastpass is a magnet . What does this mean ? Don't get them close to phones or anything magnetic . If you do , they get ""magnetized"" as the BART people say it and it won't go through the gate . Then they will right a number on the back of your fastpass and you will have to start flashing it to the BART people ( which is really annoying ) instead of sliding it through the gate and you will need to get it exchanged before that day somewhere near Powell Station ."
1007,4,"Jul 5, 2006","So I have only been living in the area for about a month and I can't tell you how great it is to have a mass transit system that is convenient...unlike LA.  I am originally from Chicago, so to have this convenient transit system is wonderful.  Get to SFO on $5...I'm there."
1008,3,"May 28, 2008",It is a necessary evil I tell you. Usually smells like urine and full of freaks. It is just preparing you for the stench of walking out of the civic center bart station. I usually have no probs as long as I have the &$@k off look on my face. But even with the smell and the freaks - it beats sitting in traffic!
1009,5,"Mar 2, 2008","I remember when the Hayward BART station opened up. I was a kid and they had this big parade and everything. I remember them saying that BART would eventually be free. Hasn't happened yet but I still love the system. High speed rail traveling at 70 mph, gets you where you want to go without being stuck in traffic-and much safer than driving a car. When was the last time a BART train hit a car or another BART train, or anything for that matter?Large comfortable roomy trains-much bigger than the green blue and gold lines in LA, running about every 15 minutes for most of the day take you to most places in the bay area except San Jose. Whenever i fly into the bay area I won't rent a car. Between, bart, a bike, a bus, and a rare taxi ride I can go just about wherever I want. I particularly like going to the oakland airport on BART. Going from Castro Valley to Oakland, when you drive you have to take 880. And the interchange getting you onto 880 is almost always backed up-but never when you ride bart."

1013,5,"Jan 12, 2011","I think we are spoiled rotten in the Bay Area by our transportation systems. Looking around the world at other transit operations reveals that we are extremely lucky with what we have. BART is incredibly well run and operated. Think about this: In the midst of a huge economic recession, BART was one of the few government agencies to actually have a surplus at the end of 2009. Do you know how big MUNI's deficit is? Yes, the trains can be crowded during rush hour, but name one transit system in the world that doesn't get crowded during rush hour.Yes, there are delays occasionally when some fucking retarded homeless drunk falls on the tracks, but that's hardly BART's fault.And fare costs? Again, looking worldwide, BART is actually astonishingly cheap."
1014,2,"Oct 15, 2010",Their upholstered seats are disgusting.  I know that replacing them all with plastic chairs would be expensive-- but at least plastic can be hosed down occasionally.
1015,4,"Sep 5, 2009","ok bart, i'm just sayin you could be a little cheaper, i know you're convenient and all but you're just a bit too expensive for me to bother going to the city as much as i want to"
1016,4,"Jul 4, 2009","Visitors need only a few things when it comes to public transportation: trains need to go where you want to, the fares need to be reasonably priced, the maps have to be easy to use, and the trains need to be clean. BART delivers each time I visit San Francisco. Last week, I took BART from Market to Concord, and all these needs were met. The eagle landed safely."
1017,4,"Jan 13, 2010","Stepping onto a BART train is like stepping into a time capsule.  The train interiors have not been updated for as long as I can remember.  The seat cushions are beyond well-worn, to the point that they are just saggy and practically pointless.  Sometimes the screeching along the rails suggests that the BART is a disaster in the making.  However, after riding on the BART for over 10 years, it is simply the best mode of transportation around the Bay Area, specifically San Francisco.  The trains are frequent and often on time.  They have a station located at SFO, with the fare to Downtown SF only being $8.10 - which is a hell of a lot cheaper than a $40 cab ride."

1020,2,"Jul 20, 2006","not too happy because the seats in the train cars can get cleaned up a bit more if not replaced.  i hate the fabric lining that they have..it should be plastic - more sanitary.  carry a liquid hand sanitizer.maybe i'll up the stars on bart if they extend service in various hot spots in the southbay.  i just want it to grow all over the bay area like how MTA is accessible all over nyc....if that happens, i'd gladly sacrifice my car."
1021,4,"Nov 20, 2008","I found the BART to be nicer than the MARTA in Atlanta, and more accessible and easier to use than the metro in D.C. (and quite possibly nicer). It is certainly easier to use than the non unified public transport composed mostly of just bus lines that we have here in the NOLA metro area."
1022,4,"Dec 6, 2010","for somebody who grew up and lived in Los Angeles their whole life like me, this type of convenient public transportation that covers most of the geographic regions of a city like San Francisco can easily strike a chord of travel envy.  it took me some time to figure out on my own how the different lines, stops, and pricing worked, but once i did, i totally want one of these for my own!yes, the ride between West Oakland and Embarcadero can get kinda bumpy and really loud.  yes, some of the stains on the seats and unpleasant aromas that follow around certain people can be unappetizing and suspect.  but other than having my legs get used to more walking around the city than i am typically accustomed to, i really didn't have much of a desire to drive my own car at all during my stay in the Bay Area, especially whenever i saw parking restrictions everywhere with the endless parking fee requirements.  some say that the BART + MUNI fees can get pricey, but as far as i'm concerned, i think i saved money!"
1025,2,"Apr 25, 2007","It's quick and effficent on the weekend. But on the weekday, it'll be like Hollister, Southwest(or Cathay Pacific/Singapore Airlines/United in Economy), and CalTrain rolled into one. Chaotic, just like stepping into Hollister on a Saturday afternoon when it's packed with soccer moms and teeny boppers. Packed, like a Southwest flight from LA/OC to OAK. And it's almost like CalTrain. The electronic fare equipment has hiccups all the time. When is BART going to use TransLink? It's a great way to get to San Francisco Center or the Coliseum/Oakland Arena or Berkeley, but for getting into the City during commute hours, I advise you to use AC Transit, WestCAT Lynx or the ferry."
1026,4,"Sep 10, 2007","happy 35th bday to bart!  (always nice to find someone/something older than me)i've been riding bart for 15 years now, from commuting to cal to the present daily work grind, and occasional ventures into the city for sports or scout events.  (plus all the union square shopping excursions w/ mom growing up!)  i've seen the transformation of train cars from the dingy brown seats to the ""newer"" teal seats and the opening of new stations down the peninsula.  i've survived one bart strike and have yet to make an emergency exit and traverse the underground tunnels *knocks on wood*yes, some seats are grimier and smellier than others, and other cars desperately need air conditioning.  there are a few uh, ""interesting"", passengers every now and then, but aside from loud ranting and rumbling, requests from spare change, and bit of indecent exposure, no harmful or malicious intent.  there are also rude passengers who don't seem to understand the concept of a line or why it's gross to clip their fingernails in public.  and yes, there is the occasional delay.but all in all, bart has been a reliable and dependable part of my life.  no need to deal with traffic or parking issues (well, aside from the increasingly crowded parking situation at daly city).  it's a quick 20-minute ride to and from work, during which i can catch up on some work, reading, or zzzs, or play some poker or pokemon games, or even do some people-watching.  i'd much rather hop on bart than deal with muni!in celebration of the 35th anniversary, bart officials are looking forward to a future of further improvements.  a few requests:- please PLEASE add more parking @ daly city- please have more trains run further down the peninsula- please have station agents announce which trains are scheduled to leave first - i know the order (pt/bay point, fremont, richmond, dublin) and it throws me off when they depart daly city in the wrong order!as long as i have to trek to the fidi for work, i'll be commuting on bart =)  i've even used it as a verb (e.g., ""are you gonna bart it downtown?"" it happened w/ tivo & google, no?)"
1027,1,"Jan 8, 2009","It s intensly socially IRRESPONSIBLE for the bart to close before bar time.  so basically if you want to come into the city to drink you have to drive. yeah, thats a good idea. SERIOUSLY?? unsafe. come on."

I would be more concerned with other dirty spots we are exposed to daily. Also, on a weekend or mid day.. bart is quiet and the seats are huge and it is the goddamn perfect spot to study or read. I could sit on it for hours with the ipod. I realize that most people bitch about the cost and, yeah it does suck it doesn't run past midnight, but for how fast and accessible it is to the towns surrounding sf I would gladly hunker down 5 bones to avoid the traffic and shitty drivers any day."

1032,5,"Feb 10, 2009","I love BART!, it's the best public transit system we have in the bay area, I love it even though it's nowhere near as great as the NYC subway which is by far the best public transit system I have ever used. I always use BART whenever I go to the city and the east bay, it drops you off right in front of the Oakland Coliseum and the Oakland Arena since they are next to each other so it's best to take it whenever you go to events there instead of driving and you're better off taking BART to the city too instead of driving since taking BART is a lot less headaches, I always take it whenever I go to watch my A's play,. I just can't wait until they bring it to San Jose so I don't have to drive 40 mins or so from my house in San Jose to get to the Fremont station but wer'e years away from that happening but I still love BART!"
1033,1,"Jul 4, 2009","OMG - I've never had a great experience using this system. OK - the prices are very high to the point of almost discouraging using public transit but I suck it up. But what's with the no food and drink rule? How is one supposed to commute with this restriction? And how hypocritical of the city of San Fran. They let people sleep, urinate and do drugs in the streets of Market Square but don't let you drink bottled water or coffee on their public transit system.  Huh?  Also, whenever I do have a problem or question the BART staff is about as rude as rude can be. Where do they find these people? Probably off the street of Market Square."
1034,2,"May 22, 2007","Please. Of all the transportation systems for major metropolitan areas in the United States BART certainly has the nicest chairs but must be one of the most inefficient systems. Where to start? Ok, the chairs. They're nice. The trains are really nice,  but this isn't the 1930's and I don't expect someone to come by and take my drink order while I relax and read the evening paper. I just want an easy, cheap way to get home where I don't have to worry about getting attacked by some crazy person or be delayed because of some punk-ass kids starting fights. The train conductors may or may not be morons, that is still up for debate. The station agents are indeed morons and there is no room for doubt there. I can't recall if I've met a meaner or sketchier group except for Hut people (not you Rajie!) than BART station agents. I've fallen asleep many-a-time on BART and getting back home is never easy because the trains stop running way too early. I'll never for the life of me understand BART's excuse as to why they stop running trains so early which is ""Maintenance"". Maybe you're just lazy and not very well managed. Because of this, countless people are put-out when trying to enjoy themselves. I can't tell you how many nights I had to end early because of BART. BART is like a demanding, possesive person who knows that you need them to take you to things and help you get around but holds it against you and controls you and always ruins your night because you need to eventually get home but you're on BART's schedule and BART is like the only person in the world who matters. BART has a huge ego.  Despite all this, I take this train at least 10 times a week because I work in the city and live in a land where Oaks grow and don't feel like driving. Call me a complainer, but BART is way behind on where it should be. Let 'em strike, let 'em eat cake for all I care. Just try and use bigger trains and run a little later into the night. Egomaniac!"
1037,1,"Jul 31, 2009","Sorry BART but in my experiences with you, you failed miserably.  I'm not even going to compare you to other transit systems in the world because then you'd look even worse.  Your employees are morons, your security sucks, your system with it's easily demagnetized cards is inefficient, and, really, you don't go very many places and where you do go is expensive.  Take this instance for example:I purchased two rides, one for leaving SFO and for one returning.  Aside from the bizarre machine that only allowed me to select an amount in $.05 increments [do you know how long that took to reach $10+?], the one leaving worked fine.  Coming back was the problem.  The card was safely stowed in my wallet, nothing touched or altered the magnetic strip, yet it would not work when I tried to swipe it through and told me to see an attendant.  My friend was already through and waiting for me.  Of course there was no one inside the two glass booths so I used the help phone on the wall and was told I needed to walk all the way on the other side of the station.  It was not a short distance and I was annoyed but off I went, leaving my friend behind.  I was met by three people all stuffed into one booth, talking and laughing with each other - why the hell weren't any of these people in either of the booths on the other side of the station?  The only one who seemed willing to bear with the inconvenience of helping me took my card with a grunt after I explained what happened, gave it back to me along with a dime [to this day I still have no idea why], said nothing to me and I walked back to other side of the station to go through the machine where my friend was standing.Again, it wouldn't go through.So I again walked all the way back to the other side and the woman said to me in a snotty tone, ""Uh, because you have to swipe it there"" and she pointed to the machines directly next to her booth.  Well, gee, wouldn't it have been nice if you said that to me before?  Not everyone is aware of BART's odd transit rituals.  When someone hands you a transit card, most people would assume you can use it in any of the machines in the station.So now I had to walk all the way back to the other side just so I could tell my friend I was going to walk all the way back to where I just was and I would meet her on the platform.  The cell phones did not work underground, obviously.  I spent 20 minutes walking back and forth across that damn station.  Then we somehow lost each other between the upstairs/downstairs but that's a whole other story.Oh and the scammers who stand by the machines and try to get you to buy their cards instead of your own - wow, way more aggressive than the people who do it in NYC.  This guy looked like an indie band hipster dropout and I had to tell him five times to leave me alone.  He [and others] were also all in full view of BART employees and of course none of them ever came over to question why these people were milling around the ticket machines all day long.  Way to go, BART workers!"
1038,5,"Jan 7, 2013","I take BART everyday from Oakland into SF. It makes my life so easy!!! The ride is less than 15 minutes and it is ALWAYS ontiem to the minute. The train comes every 7-15 minutes so I don't worry if I miss one. Every morning the cars are packed and it does not bother me at all. (it is like 10 degrees hotter in the train though than outside so take your coat off). When I ride it for other purposes than to get to work it is still a time and money saver. And sometimes there is free ""entertainment""."

I stood around waiting for a few minutes and realized later he was chatting with another staff at the far end of the station.  The parking payment system is so old, both machines and process.  After few tries at paying for parking at one of the machine did I realized that the machine is cash only, and the coin slot does not work, and it won't make change.  There was no way to use this machine to pay for 2.50 parking fare.  I don't know why there wasn't a sign to tell people to not waste their time."

1045,2,"Sep 26, 2010","So, I finally made my first trip to San Francisco last weekend. It was supposed to be a quick weekend trip in & out of town. I agree w/ previous posts that ticket dispensers are fairly confusing & make you feel rushed getting through the gates & down the escalators/stairs so you won't miss your train. Arriving via SFO to the BART station onsite was relatively painless.The pain started in my ears as I sat right next to a door, sitting sideways for my ride to Downtown SF. The nearly deafening screaming sounds the BART made going in & out of the tunnels on the yellow line bound for Pittsburg Point made deciphering what the train conductor was saying as we pulled into each stop very difficult. The cars inside look old & the carpeting does nothing to change that appearance. (Can you imagine the germs riding along w/ you in the chairs & that nasty carpeting?) The seats were surprisingly comfortable - which had to be the best part of the entire ride. After hearing the noise for more than a 1/2hr as we got to the Montgomery Street stop. My ears were ringing for the remainder of the evening & falling asleep was very difficult as my ears just kept on ringing. Next time, I'll make sure to wear ear plugs when I hop on.The worst part of the ride was when I asked for directions to the street where my hotel was located. It was tough to find a BART worker anywhere in the station at around 10:45 in the evening. The worker I found pointed me in the exact opposite direction of where I needed to go, so I roamed around a cold, wet, & foggy Downtown SF for nearly 2 hrs until I finally came to my hotel. (I asked a total of 5 individuals where 3rd Street was & finally had to purchase a street map in a nearby 7Eleven b/c I was completely unfamiliar w/ my location). I was extremely unhappy that (aside from NOBODY in SF being able to give directions  - apparently that isn't being taught in schools anymore) the one person who should've pointed me in the right direction, simply wasted my time, energy, & left me feeling pretty helpless for a time. Certainly NOT a good way to start what was supposed to be a relaxing weekend in a brand new city.I'd rate the BART customer service at their stations very poor. I'd rate the ride itself OK as it did get me there safely w/o breaking down or me having to drive a VERY tricky Downtown SF street grid late at night esp. since it was so foggy that night. The trains rock back & forth - sometimes very violently - but it is cheaper than a cab ride from the SF Int'l Airport.I was actually resolute enough to brave a return trip back to SFO at the completion of my less than 48hrs in Frisco. Will I take the BART again? Most likely I will."
1046,3,"Apr 17, 2006",Pretty gross trains but the easiest way to get to Oakland for a concert/baseball game.
1047,1,"Sep 17, 2007","why oh why BART did you opt for cloth seats? wouldn't it have been better to have had seats that could be cleaned so the trains wouldn't be filled with dirty seats and a horrible smell? I live on the peninsula so it is not often that I take BART: sometimes to work, sometimes to the airportTo take BART to the airport is frustrating. 2 trains.....why couldn't it have been designed so that you didn't have to wait for a 2nd train upon arrival?"
1050,5,"Mar 6, 2009","Oh YEAH free parking!  (But my Mom recently said that they may start charging for it.) I just love this BART station because you can always find a seat right before it starts to head into the City.

Good, clean, BART station for good, clean fun - highly recommended if you don't want to deal with driving into SF."

1052,2,"Sep 4, 2014","I've been riding on BART since the 90's, ever since I moved to the Bay Area from Chicago. I've been commuting regularly into the city for the last seven years, as I would prefer not to drive and worry about the sacrilege that is finding parking in the SoMA/FiDi. If there was a more efficient, consistently-performing, cheaper alternative (we're supposed to have jet packs and flying cars by now, right?), I'd be using it in a heartbeat...but unfortunately, I have no other choice. But after having experienced Portland, Oregon's TriMet and MAX Line systems recently, I am just filled with utter frustration with BART.Sure, every city and state government has its' hiccups when it comes to spending on public programs. Since I am not a resident of Portland, Oregon, I don't see the issues that nudge at the locals. But in regards to their public transportation system, you see where the money goes.For the most part, their drivers are basically polite, and then there are those who are downright warm and friendly, without fail. How many buses have you been on where the disembarking riders speak or shout out a ""thank you"" to the driver? Again, I'm from Chicago, and I've never really seen that in my life!Don't get me wrong: there are very warm train car operators, booth attendants, janitors and police personnel who work for BART, but they are certainly a minority. Their example should be the majority. For example, there are several train operators on the Pittsburg/Bay Point line who I find are normal, friendly voices to hear overhead. They keep you posted on delays and sometimes you can hear that they share your frustration, too. There is one gentleman in particular, who states each stop clearly and sometimes gives additional information about the stop; he also speaks in Spanish occasionally! He also ""nudges"" commuters awake right before arriving at Embarcadero. That is someone who is good at doing their job and going beyond their requirements. This is what I like.Here is what I dislike.It's what you've been hearing from many, many people before, and unless some serious changes are made, you will continue hearing many more similar comments. Let's skip the whole part about these train cars being very old. Yes, BART has been operating since the 1970's (George Lucas fans might remember how futuristic BART trains looked like when they saw them in ""THX 1138""), but these train cars were assembled as early as the late 60's, from what I understand. The train cars are technologically outdated and just downright filthy. I can't tell you how many times I give off a sigh of relief when I am able to board a train car with a bare floor AND the newer seat upholstery. If the trains are being cleaned, they're not being cleaned as much as they need to be.New train cars? Hold your breath until 2017. Three years to wait. THREE more years of waiting.Fare enforcement? Practically non-existent. The closest thing I've seen of it was at Concord station, when a BART employee yelled at a guy who tried to ""piggy back"" through the turnstile. Unfortunately, I've seen more people---mostly guys---jumping the turnstile then catching a bus than BART security enforcing the ""no ticket, no ride"" policy. These guys are rarely caught, it seems.And why the hell are there buskers ON the train? Someone else wrote in a review about a couple walking through the train cars asking for money. If it was the same couple I saw, the husband was playing an accordion. An ACCORDION. What the hell?!?And performance artists. Really?!? I grew up in the 1980's in Chicago and not ONCE did I ever see that on the Ravenswood/Brown line or any other route for that matter. Sadly, I've seen this TWICE. If you're a performance artist doing a skit on a BART train, you need to find a better paying second job because your career counselor lied to you in high school/college.I think I've said way more than I needed to, and I'm not really saying anything new. All that regular BART commuters can expect are fare hikes in the next few years, just to get the kinds of service that other cities already receive for the kind of money they put into it."

1057,1,"Oct 30, 2006",BART is disgusting! Sometimes I wish I could fall asleep on there so that I won't be conscious of the smell but I'm too scared of catching something greasy.
1058,4,"Jul 23, 2008","if you're too good to ride public transit, don't bother reading.  it won't change your mind anyways.i've taken bart  a number of times, more recently to get to giants games.  i love the convenience of not having to drive, and thus not having to find parking in the city.  not to mention being able to sleep on the way there, that's a definite plus.  it's a good reliable way to get in and out of the city.  i'm  a fan."
1059,3,"Aug 7, 2009","I've been commuting from the East Bay to SF for too many years to count.  During this time, I've done it all - BART, AC Transit, MUNI and driving my car.  Compared to the 10 year span when I drove my kids to school in SF, then took MUNI and BART in to work, my commute now is a cakewalk.  BART is a 5 minute drive from my house and 10 minute walk to my office.  So I really shouldn't complain, but it is just inherit in my nature to constantly bitch and moan. It seems that nothing (or no one) makes me happy, or is good enough for me.  I hate when the train is so crowded in the morning that there are already no available seats on the second stop to SF.  Why can't they divert some of the trains from the Pittsburg/Baypoint line that arrive every 2 minutes, and spread some of the love around?  And if I want to get a seat on the ride back home, I have to hop on a train going in the opposite direction, get off a couple of stops down, then take my regular train home.  There's always some sort of delay or other at least once a week, but overall, it still beats driving, or MUNI, so I'll quitmybitchin now."
1062,5,"Apr 10, 2013","My transit experience on this was limited, however, we weren't going anywhere crazy or off the gride so we go to where we needed decently with a few transfers to Hearst and back. The lines are confusing and take a while to get used to, however, there was no shortage of people who will help. Round trip for what is 3 zones in Vancouver is less than $5. Very reasonably priced. I would've paid $14 back home without a pass."
1063,2,"Oct 19, 2012","In New York, there is a MetroCard that offers riders the option of paying one fee for unlimited rides on buses and subways for a month. Same with Chicago's Metro system. Even Los Angeles's crappy Metro system offers a Metro day pass. But here in the Bay Area, we have to deal with overpriced transit from BART, who introduced what is quite possibly the worst possible system with the Clipper Card. You can't get a Clipper Card at a transit station. You have to go to a retailer like Walgreen's or Ace Hardware. You can't reload a Clipper Card at a transit station. You have to go to back to a retailer like Walgreen's or Ace Hardware. You can set up an Autoload for your Clipper Card, but you have to create an account on the Clipper Card website, and then call in to their Customer Service line to setup a security question, and then it can take up to ten days for your first Autoload to get loaded. Sigh. BART and its transit partners in the Bay Area need to look at New York City's system on how to do transit right, and dump this worthless Clipper Card system.As for the trains themselves, it's great they're finally replacing those disgusting old seats with new vinyl seats, but that's only a Band-Aid on a much bigger problem. Your cars are old, too many riders scoff at the rules of the system because there is zero enforcement, the air circulation inside the cars is lacking, there are too many bums who use the trains as their primary residence, and all this adds to an unpleasant ride. I only go on BART when I absolutely have to use it, which I try to do as little as possible.When I lived in Brooklyn years ago, my wife and I would go in to Manhattan all the time, because the system was cleaner and less taxing on our wallets. Needed to get from Coney Island to Dyckman Street on the New York subways? $4.00 round-trip. Round-trip from Concord to Embarcadero? $10.70. Both trips are about 26mi each way, so why is BART 2.5x more expensive? That $6.70 difference keeps me from spending $100 or more per lost visit in San Francisco."

So enjoy your bart ride to wherever your adventure takes you!!!"
1067,1,"Nov 23, 2015","BART delayed yet again.  Generally, this transportation system is terrible.  There are always equipment problems or other delays.  I tried giving them the benefit of the doubt but it is a bit hard to do so when you are constantly getting stranded and left waiting along the line.  Here's to BART, a singularly terrible option made still more terrible by the fact that it is often the single option available."
1068,3,"Nov 17, 2015","So having BART is a big help in the Bay Area.  I think most people wouldn't doubt that, and I'm grateful that it's here.  But, more recently, it's been plagued with delays!  Perhaps it's jut the timing of when I take BART, but there are so many delays due to equipment failure issues.  Also, the parking is getting to be really expensive!  All in all, it seems like we are pouring more and more money into this system and getting less and less back.  I really wish would BART would pull itself together and get back on the right track, but based on what I've seen so far, I sort of doubt it will."
1069,1,"Mar 18, 2009","Why was the train stopped at 24th St. yesterday afternoon for a ""BART police incident""? BART police were harassing the handicapped, detaining him for 5 hours and collecting $155 from him.  Yesterday, a friend who is legally handicapped decided to take the train to see me. He cannot walk well and usually gets a ride, and hadn't ridden BART in a few years.. He purchased a handicapped-price ticket and boarded without incident in Daly City. By the 24th St station, cops were on the scene and dragged him from the train. (How were they alerted anyway? Is this what BART is using their $5.4m grant from Homeland Security for?)  He showed them his leg braces and Medi-Cal i.d. to no avail - it seems now you need to show them your Medicare card. His phone was grabbed from him when it rang, and he was not allowed to call anyone (like me, the person waiting for him), thank you. He says he was verbally harassed. He was fined $80 and forced to buy a $75 ""appropriate"" i.d. (one that as far as we can determine from BART's website costs $3)  and not allowed to continue on his journey - his wife had to pick him up at 24th St. Of the many things I dislike about BART - the constant fare hikes, the lack of direct service to a large percentage of its area, the four-car trains that are jammed full, the fact that it stops running before the bars close, so many other fine qualities - this one got me to speak out."
1070,3,"Apr 5, 2009","BART is clean and seems to be on-schedule.  It really helped us to get downtown pretty quickly from the airport.However, public transportation normally DOES NOT COST THAT MUCH.    Here is a comparison from Chicago- to take the CTA blue line downtown from O'Hare (17 miles outside of downtown), it costs $2.25.  That is AFTER a recent fare increase!  For me to take BART downtown from SFO (under 11 miles), it was $5.35.  Even the more expensive (nicer) Metra would only cost $3.80 to take downtown from O'Hare.Anyway, I was happy that it got us there quickly and cheaper than a cab, and the seats were comfortable.  I'll give it 3 stars."

1075,1,"Jul 15, 2016","I have been on public transit systems throughout the world and BART is one of the worst because the station employees do not seem to think they actually work for the public.  Forget about getting help at the stations; I'm not even sure why they have the disinterested and surly people ""working"" there. And can anybody ever understand what the individuals over the intercoms on the train are saying?  I have never been paid for doing nothing so I am not sure why Bart employees feel they should be. It's a shame because it could be a really good system and there would be more public support if only Bart employees from the top down would act like they care even a little bit about your experience."

It ain't right."" Pausing briefly he stood and decomposed his stance, shoulders straightening and wrists going slight with a hint of limp. He pushed his head back with dramatic aplomb, a second personality throwing out a response as flamboyant as it was unexpected, ""Oh sweetie, but one simply must check-in early lest you miss your flight. We really can't have have people missing flights, now can we dear?"" It was black man met Martha Stewart, the former taking manic offense at his split-headed indiscretion.

1079,5,"May 29, 2008","My friend BART! Sure the prices have gone up over the years, but it definitely is convenient when you're trekking into the city. With the price of gas, parking...the headaches of traffic and etc, it's always worth the piece of mind to hop on the train and go. Bart in my opinion is superior to any other rapid transit system in California...esp. LA and SD. From the howling sounds of the train on the tracks, down to the toot of the signature horn, there's nothing like the Bart experience."

They say on the news that they are going to clean up the messy trains with all that surplus money they have this year.  I'm still pissed about that shirt that got ruined with a chewing gum stain.  So aparently there are actual Bart Police?  Where the hell are they?  I wanna see one walking though a train just once.  I ride this thing 3 times a week and have never seen one.  Why am I complaining about this?  Why are you reading a review this long about bart?  Remember to bring reading material because its not that rapid.
1082,1,"Feb 20, 2013","Today it rates somewhere between zero and one.  Some days it makes it to 3 and pushes toward 4.  I don't think I could ever give it a 5.   Today, their ""10 to 15 minute delay"" translated to a 45 minute longer commute because, when there is a delay in the commute direction, you can't possibly get on a packed train at a transfer station like MacArthur.  I took a train in the other direction to downtown Oakland to see if I could get on, but two more trains completely jammed with commuters passed before I could get on board.  But the icing on the cake was their announcement around Orinda that it was no longer a Concord train; they were turning it back at Pleasant Hill.  Everyone going further waited on a scary, overly-crowded platform for 8 minutes for the next fairly-full train.  And when we got to Concord, BART had obviously done the same thing there to a previous train because that platform was full too.  This all feels like some kind of BART control center power trip!Random points on BART's inept inefficiencies:-The heat and air conditioning settings on any given car have nothing to do with external temperatures.-The digital signs in the stations that provide train times are right about 20% of the time.  The signs for which track to use to catch the appropriate train are right about 80% of the time.-The train operators are highly unprofessional with comments like ""I know it's tight, but squeeze closer and smile at your neighbor"" -- not what you want to hear when you're already 40 minutes late. LOTS of smart-alec employees making smart-ass remarks.-Big lead-in announcements, ""This is a special announcement from the BART operations control center"" to tell you which elevators are broken down.  That's just kind of pathetic.-The train speaker volume is often either so low it's inaudible or so loud it hurts your ears.-Their is NO coordination between Pittsburg and Richmond lines at MacArthur station and you are just apt to see train doors close in your face as you are to wait 15 minutes or more for a train.-The stations are filthy -- people-grime yes -- but holding the railing as I ascended stairs left my hand absolutely black with grime in Oakland tonight.-There was a bat flying around the 19th Street station tonight -- ok, not really a BART issue, but I was waiting for panic to set in on the crowded platform.-Changing the destination of the train during the trip is a major major slap-in-the-face to us riders.  It really kills any sense that you think they CARE about getting people delivered on time.-Raising rates, paid parking, paid bicycle lockers, in-your-face advertising that provides revenue, etc. with the trains, stations, elevators/escalators and service in such a filthy and unreliable state is incomprehensible. -No food, drink, smoking, loud music rules that are constantly disobeyed by those who don't care because there are no repercussions, except an occasional blast by a station agent through the loud speaker system that impacts all the rest of us.-There is NO use for BART time tables.  They have absolutely nothing to do with when a train actually arrives at a station.  Hilarious to see people looking up the times on these boards in the stations; waste of paper, ink, space, whatever.-BART technology and stations are worn-out vestiges of some prior decade which the agency fails to properly upgrade; they seem to have no interest in turning it into a world-class system, perhaps because they are already so far behind.These are just some of my observations on the BART side.  The commuters themselves should have a book written about them!  Strange, strange, strange ideas of what is appropriate and acceptable public behavior.I have major issues with the violent apprehensions made by BART police officers, but I have recently witnessed two different officers being exceptionally caring and nice to a person who appeared to have Down's Syndrome.  Those rare occasions are wonderful to see.I know it is better than sitting in traffic jams with people who are driving while using their cell phones.  I just wish I could afford to live within walking distance of my office!  I do find it astonishing that a high-tech center like the Bay Area can't have something a whole lot more reliable and user-friendly but affordable.My challenge to all you who feel the need to rant about BART -- what does that acronym really stand for?  And please don't tell me Bay Area Rapid Transit.  I want to hear much more creative responses!  ...more along the lines of Basically Awful Reliance-free Trains.Or, if you're more inclined, how about a BART subtitle that the agency could use in their marketing campaigns, like ""BART -- We apologize for the inconvenience"".I just needed to get a horrible commute off my chest, but feel free to have some fun with your public responses here.  :)  Oh, and don't forget ""to check around you for personal belongings"".  Shall I list those for you? ""wallets, cell phones, newspapers"" LOL"

BART you bring people together.sorry i can't give you five stars.  the fares are getting outrageous.  if you could figure out a monthly pass situation that would earn you that fifth and oh so awesome fifth star."

I always thought of you as being similar to my first boyfriend -- basically reliable, a little smelly, and kinda dirty. And like my first boyfriend, I didn't really appreciate you at the time. Now that I regularly use MUNI, which is always late (or doesn't show up at all), I realize how good you actually were."
1091,4,"Jun 21, 2007","I really have to give BART kudos for the new SFO station. Instead of paying a insane amount of $45 for a cab to the airport, I shelled out something like 5 bucks to get from downtown to SFO. It only took 25 minutes. Really! I promise! Seats are fairly comfortable and the people were fine. This isn't like MUNI, where a meth head will sit next to you and begin telling you that they just defecated in their pants."

It isn't perfect at all, it still isn't a N.Y. subway or anything, but it will get you where you need to go.  don't think of it as the end all of mass transit, but it does work as the main branch with Muni and A.C. transit branching off."

1094,3,"Jun 14, 2006","I'm a relatively new (since April '06) daily commuter on BART.  So far, so good -- a definite improvement over MUNI (I rode the N-Judah to work for 3 years). First, the good: (1)  BART trains are much more comfortable than MUNI's fleet of light rail trains.  This is probably a no-brainer, but I appreciate the width of the cars (cuts down on the ""cattle car"" effect) and the fact that they have carpeted floors (which I like mainly for the noise reduction factor, and for comfort on those days when I have to stand, which is fairly rare). (2)  BART has a great on-time ""track record,"" with some notable exceptions (see below). (3)  BART's station stops throughout the Bay Area all seem fairly logical to me; the layout of the system was planned very well. Now, the bad: (1)  Many (most?) BART trains need to have all or most of their seats reupholstered.  Yesterday. (2)  Almost all of BART's fairly avoidable service interruptions seem to take place during rush hour (obstacles blocking the track, computer malfunctions shutting down the Transbay Tube, to name a few).  This is a mystery to me. (3)  As much as I believe MUNI needs to raise its fares, I also believe BART is a bit over-priced, and should consider evaluating its fare structure systemwide. Bottom line:  for the most part, BART is pretty da** good, largely reliable, and its service to the airports is always a better alternative to taking a cab or driving yourself."

How do they not realize that these incentives will greatly increase ridership and revenues when gas prices go up again?     BART is always on time. But they are on time because they don't run enough trains to have a chance of messing up.  I also am surprised at the relative lack of crime with the missing security.  They barely have people at the booths, much less BART police (except at the coliseum).  Also, in response to a recent battery theft in my gf's car, all the BART cops say is ""don't come to West Oakland.""     Recently, the DRUNKEST day worker had to puke his brains out right before we get to the tunnel so I could not get off the putrid train and had to sit through it.

But we also hate that it's expensive (if you ride every day) and doesn't take you to every knuck and cranny of the bay area.   That's why it's in the middle at 3 stars.   But compare BART to New York City's Metro, which is the total opposite. Sure, their ugly trains don't have the clean lines and bright lit interiors like BART and the ricketty commute feel like you're traveling down a coal mine but, the dang thing takes you all over the place...all for the same set price, no matter the distance.  Their set price is currently lower than the cheapest BART fare!!!  Do you need to travel in relative comfort or would you want something like the Metro, which is cheaper and not too pretty?  Personally, I'd rather have something that takes me all over the place at a better price."
1105,5,"Jul 28, 2005","I love BART, it's one of the best transit systems on the west-coast. It's cheap considering how far you can go. You can even take it to the airport instead of a taxi.

Uhm it stops at 16th & mission and 24th & mission!!!! yessss 5 minutes away from amazing Mexican food and lots of dollar stores and I don't have to transfer buses or anything 9. ""Bay Area Rides Together"" is probably the best slogan for any transit agency Things I Don't Like1. Stops running before 1 am 2. Richmond train doesn't go to my house on the weekends3. Can be pretty pricey sometimes but that's what the emergency exit gate is for, am i right? ha just kidding....True other areas may have better public transit systems but if you consider the fact that in New York there are approx 2-5 million rides per day(more than all US public transit combined) or the Chicago ""L"" which has 658,524 each weekday compared to approx 380,000 a week for BART I think we have a pretty good system. Maybe if more people used BART we could get to a point where they could lower the prices and still increase the number of cars. Or maybe if there was a big enough demand it could run 24hrs?Overall if you put the actual size of the Bay Area into prospective BART is pretty damn awesome!!!!!"
1113,4,"Mar 8, 2012","You can get from the Airport to San Fran or San Fran back to the airport for $8.10 each way.  The seats are padded and comfy.  Once you get to the station, you simply buy a ticket.  You can pay via cash or credit card.  Once you get to the city, you can take a cab (Not an abundant supply like Chicago), or bus/trollly. It's a super easy way to get from the airport to the city. I don't know the other uses."
1114,2,"Dec 4, 2011","Not a lot of experience with public transportation. It was cheaper than taking a cab where we were going but I think I will stick with the cab next time. The cars and seats were quite filthy and stained, a small stench as well. Felt like I needed to take a shower and was my clothes when I got off."
1115,3,"Mar 21, 2016",Bart is Overpriced charges you by how far you are going most other public transit rail charges only one flat rate no matter the distance.
1116,4,"Feb 19, 2006","Anything that can get you from downtown Berkley to the corner of Powell and Market in under 25min. is a god-send. I only paid 3.25 for a one way trip across the bay, cant beat that! Especially when you know of the hellish traffic over the bay bridge on the weekends. Oh transfer stations make for swift easy transit change from BART to the MUNI Metro system."
1117,3,"Mar 15, 2016",BART has had so many issues recently.  They continue to have issues that do not appear to be resolving. New issues every day resulting in delays as a routine event every day. It is discouraging when one pays a lot for BART already.
1118,3,"Nov 4, 2005","three qualms:  1) too expensive 2) should run more during rush hours 3) should run past midnight on friday's and weekends otherwise, bart is great!"
1119,4,"Nov 10, 2009","I can't believe I've just spent so much time reading reviews about BART.  I must really miss SF.  BART is an anomaly on the West Coast.  Where else do you have a rail system largely built in the early 70s that takes you to many of the big destinations in a metropolitan area? (Who are you fooling?  No one wants to go to San Jose.)  Certainly not LA, San Diego or Seattle.  What's great:- It's fast and efficient.  - It'll take you a lot of places in downtown SF (w/ connections to the Muni Metro & plenty of buses) , the Mission, downtown Oakland, and downtown Berkeley.- It feels like a rollercoaster.- Great views of the East Bay.- Relatively safe and clean as far as mass transit goes.  Okay, it's not Tokyo, but it certainly isn't as dirty and stinky as the NYC Subway.What's not so great:- Compared to other cities, it's kind of expensive.  (Compared to other cities though, getting into, parking, and leaving SF is expensive too).  - Save the Mission and the Market Street Corridor, BART doesn't really go anywhere worth while in SF.  A lot of non-San Franciscans and even locals don't like Muni so they don't go places BART doesn't go.  SF and the region as a whole would benefit from a line underneath Geary Blvd, and if a Geary line ever got built, then a Park Presidio/19th Ave line to Daly City creating a loop should be next.  (If only!) Why spend billions upon billions to extend service to San Jose and Livermore when hardly anyone out there is going to ride it?- The ridership may not warrant 24/7 service, but why don't you at least stay open until 3am on Fridays and Saturdays?  DC with a similarly aged and built system does it.- It's not very intuitive.  Thank god I started riding BART and Muni with the help of locals, otherwise I would have never figured it out.  Okay, that's my two cents.  I'd better stop now, otherwise I won't stop."
1120,3,"Oct 3, 2010","3.5 stars...I don't have a lot of experience using the BART system but enough to voice a little review. BART is the subway/train system allowing San Franciscians to get in and out of the city and to bringing people to and from the airport. The trains and stations I found to be pretty clean, the seats on the train to be comfortable, and the BART map and automated ticketing stations to be extremely easy to read. Prices for BART tickets are a tad high (it's $8.10 to get from downtown to the airport), and at the moment there is no card to allow you unlimited access to all of BART and MUNI (though if you only need BART within city limits the Clipper Card would probably work for you). The system within the city is limited so don't expect to use BART to get around San Francisco but it is the best way to get out of the city for a day if you don't have a car. If you're more familiar with NYC transportation MUNI is like the MTA and BART is like the LIRR (or Metro North or NJT). I have 3 main issues with BART, first is that there are a few lines and it's not 100% clear which line you're getting on (only the direction), the second is that there aren't any announcements on what stop you're arriving at (and if there is an announcement it's completely inaudible), and the last issue is that when the doors open at a stop its extremely hard to figure out which stop your at because it's only labeled with small letters every 200 or so feet so you've got to do a lot of careful and quick scanning to make sure you're not missing your stop. BART isn't the worst sytem in the world but it definitely has its kinks."
1123,4,"Jul 22, 2012","I was massively impressed with this station. It was right from the airport to downtown for me and the price system was confusing. It cost a little less than $10 to get downtown from the airport. I asked one of the workers how much, and was surprised at the price since signs said otherwise. He was right. Exit fares were useful coming and going. The inside was comfy. Taking the BART from the metro train was an exercise in confusion, and confusion won. I really liked that I didn't have to take an expensive cab, nor try to navigate metro trains and buses to get downtown."
1124,1,"Jul 11, 2006","I try the subway system in every city I have visited. I have to say BART is the poorest performer so far. The fare is expensive and it doesn't get you anywhere. It stops at midnight and that pretty much mean one has to drive on a night out which really does not help cut down dui does it? And there is always some obnosous kid on the car to make the ride hell. For crying out loud, it is a transit system, not a side show."
1125,4,"Aug 25, 2007","well i just visited nor cal yesterday and i took the bart with my freinds for the ""experience""well i thought it was fun and it really wasnt too bad in terms of smell and cleanliness. people were nice and friendly and the bart is indeed rapid at what it does"

1127,5,"Jan 8, 2006","I can review the BART? Well, without the BART I would be driving... So, how can I repay this rather large debt except by saying that the BART keeps millions of people in the bay area moving without having to sit on the bridge for hours and hours... thank you, BART. I love you."
1128,4,"Jun 19, 2006","I actually missed the cut for the position to be the overhead announcer for the BART.  The guy that beat me out though really needed the cash, and he's got a great voice. I love the BART due to convenience in airport drop off and parking avoidance. That's all i use it for. It saves time and money for self or friends that are coming in or going out of SFO or OAK. If you can handle the occasional half eaten pear on the floor and stares from odorfull passengers then GO BART."
1129,4,"Jul 10, 2006",BARTs convenience is dependent on where you are. If you live or work near a station it's so awesome. It used to take me from work to the bar in mere minutes on lazy days. Great way to get to As and Raiders games and stay buzzed. It gets me to/from both SFO and OAK but I have to take a cab to the station which incurs an extra $8. Still with the $3 something fare it comes out cheaper and more efficient than those blue buses that are your other option. I definitely agree some disinfectant is in order and some accountability on the part of other riders would make it a way more pleasant experience.
1130,2,"Jul 12, 2006","I remember riding BART as a kid when I would come to visit family during the summer. It always seemed so fun and exciting head into San Francisco. Fast forward about 15 years (circa 2000)... BART seemed a bit worse for the wear, the trains were more crowded, and there were unidentifiable stains on the seats. If it was that bad then, I don't even want to know what it is like now. I gave up on taking BART to the airport a long time ago, and now just park at PCA Parking ($8.99/day with coupon!), or if I'm traveling for work and really want to be lazy, I'll just park at the terminal and expense it. I'm all for public transportation when it's convenient, but who the hell wants to accidentally sit in a piss soaked seat on the way to the airport?!"
1131,4,"May 2, 2008","When Dave Chappelle visited the Bay Area, he noted how similar it was to New York's culture, diversity and how liberal this city was. He also mentioned how SF has its own subway train just like the Metro in the east coast. And so why I mention this is because I am proud of BART, not totally satisfied but content. I have to admit that I haven't had so much experience in taking trains all over the US or the world... but so far BART is still on top of my list (after taking NYC sub, Philippines' LRT, train in New O, etc) I mention this for BART is pretty good about keeping the trains clean and that the seats are so comfortable that I can close my eyes and rest for the whole ride. Also, BART is living up to its convenience, accommodation like stretching its stops to SFO. A couple times I've had to take Bart to SFO for weekender vacations and it met my expectations in re to time efficiency and convenience.However, on certain days BART trains are late and unreasonably priced(right when you get near the SF downtown area )"
1132,3,"Jun 6, 2009",My last weekend was my first time using the BART. My friends and I were spending the weekend in the Bay Area. We flew into Oakland Airport and took the BART over to SF. It was a good trip.  The subway reminded me of my times in Hong Kong.  I was would take the subway all the time when I was there.   It's  a good way to get from the airport to SF. We were staying in Union Square so we were able to get off the Powell Street exit and just walk a couple of blocks to the Hilton where we were staying at.  It's easy on the wallet so there's more money to party with. =)
1135,4,"Dec 5, 2009","So glad this exists, it makes life so much easier to go to the city, go home from college and not have to deal with parking and gas! Sometimes the trains are delayed, but usually only when there is a bad storm. You meet really interesting people on the trains too! There website even tells you what's near each BART station, so you can explore the whole bay."
1136,2,"Jun 7, 2010","*Review is only about the situation that the letter describes*  In general BART is pretty solid.Dear BART-I am writing to express dissatisfaction with the strict regulation surrounding the usage of BART parking for regular BART patrons.  On the morning of Thursday, June 3, I parked at BART per my normal work commute.  However, I had a special situation--I would be traveling to a work off-site in a co-workers car (meeting my co-worker at BART to hitch a ride in the morning) but would be returning from work via BART to Walnut Creek (so needed to park my car).  Instead of making a commotion and trying to ""sneak"" by through the handicap gate to pay the $1 parking fee, I proceeded to explain my situation to the agent at the kiosk.  She listened and then strictly responded ""Unfortunately we aren't setup that way.  Parking is limited and we just can't allow it.""  I further asserted that if this were a normal morning I would have occupied the parking space during my regular commute (so the comment about limited parking was irrelevant to the situation at hand).  Had I reacted quicker I would have asked her to reference my EZ Rider transaction history--she would have seen my daily commute from the Walnut Creek to Macarthur station and understood that I was not trying to cheat the system.  There is a clear history showing payment of parking at Walnut Creek along with my normal faire to Macarthur and back.I didn't want to cause a scene so asked if I could enter and exit, the response I received was ""It's your choice.""  Because I needed to leave my car, I entered (as documented on my EZ Rider card history) at 7:37:58 and exited the gate at 7:38:12 after paying my $1 parking fee, a total of under one minute.  It's clear that BART has setup the system to charge potential parking offenders (that use parking when not using the BART system) the maximum one-way faire fee, as the charge associated with my entry/exit was $5.20. It is outrageous that I must pay the full one-way faire to enable a smooth commute the one day that I rode BART one-way.  I am completely aware of BART's need to prevent non-BART riders from parking in the lot (and I am in support of this), however, there should be some degree of common sense used by the agents.  What can be done to improve this system and correct this unnecessary charge?Pertinent information:Date/Time: Thursday, June 3, 2010. 7:35am Station: Walnut CreekBART Stall #: 40 (parked on the day of 6/3/10)BART EZ Rider: ****I appreciate your consideration and timely response.  Please feel free to contact me with any questions or if needed, please escalate this inquiry.A loyal BART rider,Christopher W."
1137,4,"Mar 31, 2008","We all know BART has its issues, but coming from New York and the subways, BART is a commuter dream come true. The smell is not half as bad, the seats are much more comfortable, and the signboards in the stations tell you when to expect the next train. The only major downside is the lack of late-night service and less than stellar coordination with surface transit options."
1138,3,"Jul 25, 2008",It is what it is. Gets me from Oakland International to Millbrae where my family is in decent time. I wish i could drink a Coke while on the train but I understand the no food or drink policy.
1139,4,"Nov 7, 2009","I am an active BART Rider. I take Bart to work, to downtown to hang out with friends and to sporting events. Almost everywhere I take BART to (since I don't own a car). The service is good. Gets me from point A to point B fast. It's USUALLY on time, sometimes the train breaks down and theirs delays. Every public transit system has delays."
1140,4,"Nov 1, 2010","System works quick, on time, for the most part clean, and free of the really scary dangerous people, but I don't think Cali has too many of them anyways, our weathers too nice ;)"
1141,5,"Jan 5, 2011","Not the cleanest but it is def convenient. We need something like this in Los Angeles. Love the subway, has that city new York Chicago feel."
1142,4,"Jun 14, 2011","I've taken BART a few times from Dublin to SF and I must say, I wish they had a system as convenient as this in Los Angeles. No hassling with transfer tickets or bus drivers who don't stop and gas it as you line up by the bus stop. No joke. At least with BART you get dropped off right at the A's stadium. Why can't the Dodgers have something like this?"
1143,2,"Jan 27, 2006","Bart is way better than the disgusting, vomit inspiring MUNI but can they clean it???  Can they just steam clean the seats once a week.  I don't like sitting in seats that are stained and smell like vinegar.  I hold my breath and try not to touch anything with my bare skin.  EW."
1144,4,"Sep 11, 2006","it is what it is, and it gets me where i need to go.  on a regular basis, i only take it to the mission, and it's easy b/c i can pretty much hop on the first train that comes thru, and i don't have to wait for a specific one.  i've taken it around the bay area too, and as long as the station is close to your destination (or you have someone to pick you up =), you're set. the cloth seats kind of freak me out, and it tends to be really REALLY cold.  but it runs a lot later than i thought it did.  and when i decide to hang out late in the mission, that makes me happy."
1147,3,"Mar 28, 2007","Pretty dope, definitely gets me where I want to go and quick.  Minus one star for not letting me eat/drink on here, and minus one star for being dingy as hell.

1148,4,"Jul 2, 2007","Not glamorous, can be smelly, is often filled with sketchy characters, there are probably diseases in the seats, but you gotta love it. I grew up on BART, and used it to get to work when I didn't have a car. It's reliable, just a few bucks to get to most places (including the City and airports.) It beats paying for parking if you're going to the City, a baseball game or the airport. Bring hand sanitizer."
1149,4,"Aug 4, 2007","I'm from newyork so good public transportation is hard to find as far as I am concerned.  but BART is pretty damn good.  Oh, sure it's not the NYC Subway but it has it's own charm which I can not take away from it.  The trains are sometimes late, but generally they are on time....The cars themselves are futuristic with their carpetting and what not...The trains themselves remind of something from robocop-era Detroit...and the people watching is excellent...I just that they ran 24 hours like in new york.."
1150,4,"Dec 16, 2007","I love riding the BART, it is so easy compared to other means of transportation. I use it to get to the the mission, the airport, and Berkeley. I tend to load up ten dollars at a time and that lasts me a few weeks. So far I've never been delayed, but I never use it during rush hours."
1151,3,"Jan 2, 2008","BART has its stages of efficiency but when its bad, its really bad. If you're just going around SF from one station to another its really not bad, but the prices keeping rising and the service never gets any better. If you're coming from the East Bay to SF be prepared to spend $10/day because there is no student discount, monthly pass, or any other sort of meaningful loyalty discount. Also, the parking situation in the East Bay is atrocious especially at the Fremont station. I have actually been hours late to work or school because I spent an hour or two circling the parking lot. Also, if you catch the train at its starting or ending point be prepared to have the train park on the platform with its doors shut for 10 minutes then sit in the stagnant train for another 10-15 minutes on the platform. Its definitely a valuable service but the high prices, bad parking, and early closures (12:15AM is the last train) will annoy a frequent rider to no end. But then again, when I lived in SoCal they had no real mass transit system..."
1152,5,"Apr 17, 2009","I love BART! It makes going around a lot easier. The only complaint I have is the price of going outside of SF, but besides that I love it."
1153,1,"Jan 17, 2010","The more I travel to other cities and see their fancy subway systems, the more BART feels like 3rd world transportation in one of the best cities in the world. There is no excuse for this bullshit. My one star protest begins now!"
1154,4,"Jul 2, 2010","I'm gonna give Bart some props on the mere fact it makes our city green. I think Bart has improved over the years when all we had was Daly City and Balboa. Now you can take it to the SFO, Colma, SSF and Tanforan. It beats paying for parking in SF and looking for parking! The only thing I would say is clean the trains a bit more, but I feel blessed we have Bart in the Bay Area. SSF is my favorite Bart station!"
1155,4,"Mar 25, 2011","Oh BART..... Well, living in the City... unless I'm going to the Mission, BART is pretty useless to me.  I wouldn't be writing a review, claiming ambivalence as the tracks are literally ""beneath me"".BUT....Ended up getting a man who lives overseas (Concord, to be exact) and BART and I have become great friends.  Let's hit the basics....A lot of public transit systems completely blow.  They're crowded, smelly, inefficient, and add time to your commute.  BART is SOOO not these things...WHY I LOVE IT-BART can actually be MUCH faster than driving when commuting to and from the city at peak hours.-BART say, ""Its okay Michael, I'll drive"" when I'm paper bagging my to-go cocktail in my Gucci tote. (as long as its before 12pm *see below*)-BART has seats that can be a little questionable and I have read SOOO many complaints on here about them.  Listen... STOP complaining that the seat appears to be dirty.  I'll let you in on the secret... THEY'RE DISGUSTING.  Its a petri dish.  Lesson to be learned?  Just don't lick the damn thing and you'll be FINE.  Its cushy and when I'm making rides in excess of 15 minutes I appreciate it greatly.-BART can and is most likely to provide you with SOME form of entertainment, be it a dancing naked crazy man, a glorious conversation to overhear, or watching some pornographically disturbing make-out session with either two gross middle aged to elderly adults or two pimply teens (and no, those are the only age groups who do that and you know it).  And lastly, -BART keeps the East Bay crowd underground and out of my potential street parking spots.WHY I DON'T LOVE IT-BART......... Bart, bart, bart.  You need to LISTEN right now and LISTEN GOOD.  Run past FREAKIN 12AM.  And I mean AT LEAST until like, 2:30 am.  I'm serious now.  Don't even begin to play wit me cuz ima take out mah hoops and fight chu.Do you even KNOW how man car loads of club crashers drive over the Bay Bridge to hit up city spots?  And I'll tell you exactly what happens... Tina (generic condescending female who is pretending to be matronly and responsible to avoid her serious relationship issues in that she NEEDS a man, a real prince this time, and can't seem to find one) says, ""Oh, I'll drive.  I promise, no worries... I'm super hung over from last night anyway (what, Tina, hung over from the lifetime reruns and Kleenex brand tissues with lotion to wipe away your tears of shame? No, you're right, it was probably those big plans you had... ha.)THEN Tina texts her ""BFF"" dude who lives in another city just to see what's up (not like she hasn't been in love with him for 5 years after they roomed together in college or something) only to find that he's out on a date with some tramp from the marketing department at his mediocre job thats pays way less than Tina's though she pretends that she's jealous to make him feel like a real man...  And you know what, I bet he's taking the date to Applebees or some shit like that.  Probably for the two for one happy hour on cocktails and appetizers...... or somethingWell WATCH HER!  Because there goes your DD.... Next thing you know she's demanding chardonnay at a DIVE bar because she's had enough and this is really going to be the time that she stops talking to him... And you're screwed.SEE Bart?  THAT'S why you have to run past midnight.  Because those idiots think Tina can handle it as soon as she stops crying, and then they get in the car and DRIVE back across the damn bridge.Well, fellow yelpers.  I think you can clearly see my thoughts on the good ol' Bay Area Rapid Transit, and you can agree with why I've given them only 4 stars, rather than 5."
1156,2,"Oct 30, 2011","They get two stars only because the actually now go to the airport. Other than that, they are the dirtiest, noisiest trains on earth, and I've been on a lot of trains and subways in developing countries. It's almost deafening when BART takes on some of those turns, and the urine smell in some of the trains, and the stained cushions, and the old newspapers, and the smelly people. Ugh. Makes me happy I ride my bike around town."
1159,1,"Jan 16, 2016","BART recently raised rates, but service keeps getting worse and worse. Earlier this evening they were running only 5 car trains from SF to Richmond instead of the usual 8 or 9 car trains. Needless to say the cars were packed. Last night I rode the connector from Oakland airport--it was slow and stopped at a phantom station on the way. The last time I road the connector, it kept stopping and starting and backing up. It took 15 minutes. When I got on BART the car was filthy and smelled bad. When I ask agents for help they are often rude and unhelpful. I don't know why the public puts up with incompetent management at BART."

I always feel like I need to take a flea bath and either wash or dry clean my clothing after sitting on those stained and smelling of I don't know what seats. Sometimes I think about what I'm sitting on, but I really don't want to - it probably will make me puke. I'm glad I don't need to commute to work on BART or anywhere else.  I take BART 3-4 times a year and that's enough for me.  The only pro is that it is easy to get around and fairly reliable, but that is about it."

1164,3,"Dec 25, 2007","Public transportation is extremely important, and we're fortunate to have BART-! still... it could do a lot better of a job. I think people praise it here because Californians are so used to the idea of not having public transportation that they have very low standards. Anyone who's been around the world and seen metros in place in cities much poorer than San Francisco would be hard-pressed to call the BART fantastic.Going from the East Bay to the west Bay to commute to work is *very* expensive, although it did bring down my auto insurance rates a few hundred dollars a year. I'm talking like $120 a month just to go to work...  this is not an affordable option for low income people, but it beats driving a car.And the midnight closures... geez! what's with that? That being said, it's remarkable that BART's in place, and considering the history of Californian government, corruption goes hand in hand with projects like the Bay Bridge, MUNI & the BART. It's also bad to compare the bart to other systems since they depend on so much funding from the fares--Bay area people should definitely cough up more money for the BART, whether it's through some form of gas tax or auto tax..."

1171,4,"May 22, 2006","Compared to most cities mass transit, I'll take BART any day of the week. Compared to something like Path in Jersey or Metrorail in upstate/connecticut, Bart ain't that expensive and is pretty reliable most of the time. Only thing I hate about it is the refusal to run overnight. Even if it was just one train an hour, that would make a HUGE difference."
1172,3,"Jun 25, 2009","Really is OK. If I were a pragmatist, BART would be getting 2 stars, lucky for them I'm a train fan.Here goes: faster service, cleaner cars, cleaner stations, lower fares, more frequent service, less pay to employees, better managers/directors and newer rail cars are just some of the thousands of ways BART NEEDS to improve.I'm going to take Muni instead until BART gets itself together, lowers its  fare and restores normal service (referring to fare increase and service cuts for July/Sep 09)."
1173,5,"Dec 17, 2010","Public transportation is the key if you're low on funds and/or care about leaving a decent environment for your children to grow up in. There's not a vast quantity of public transport in LA so it's a relatively new idea for me.  The biggest problem is that I'm directionally challenged so getting on and off the right train was difficult... Luckily I had some friends there to guide me otherwise I'm not sure where I would've ended up!  Overall, I'm pleased with the system they set up in this magnificent city. Next time I'll pay more attention and I'm sure I'll be just fine."
1174,4,"Jun 20, 2008","This is the BEST public transportation system in the Bay Area.  Fast, efficient and you can trust the schedules.  Safer than MUNI or AC Transit.  A bit pricey but worth it.  Only pet peeve is that they do not enforce the ""No food on trains"" rule."

1177,2,"Feb 23, 2010","I pretty much hate BART.  It's expensive (like $9 or more to get to the East Bay and back, which is absurd), the commute times are long, the trains don't come very often, and often time you'll have some smelly, smelly people riding with you.  The trains are dirty as can be, and they're often late.  Sometimes they just stop for minutes on end.  One thing it has going for it is it's not the Chicago El, which I despise.  One more thing, they close around midnight, so if you're drunk, drink a cup of coffee before riding BART late at night.  Believe me, I've been stranded in Pittsburg/Bay Point more than once, having to cab it to my destination in Lafayette/Berkeley/Walnut Creek.  Not fun."
1178,4,"Jan 22, 2011","Cheaper than driving daily and parking. Some trains smell like piss though. Considering I work in oakland, love in the tri city, this is far better than driving (driving = $45 in gas every 4-5 days, $11 daily in parking, walking to the meter to keep feeding change so I don't get a ticket, plus food?) Now its only $8, no parking (get dropped off at bart) short walk from the vary station to the tattoo shop, how can I really go wrong?"

1183,3,"Nov 11, 2012","I think it would be better if all the train operators were communicative about no bikes at rush hour and reminded passengers about stepping off the train to let people off when it's crowded.  The few that do this get 5 stars.  Also, when there is a long delay like the evening we were stuck in the tunnel 30 minutes and only heard once about moving shortly it would be nice if the operator came on more than once so we knew he was still alive.  The worst thing is people who spit sunflower seeds on the seats and floors and the people who cut in and refuse to wait in line.  I once asked the girl who shoved her trash with half eaten food in it to take it with her when she exited.  It was a nasty sausage thing she was eating on the train.  She asked who I thought I was.  I'm just another person who expects the same respect I give.  I don't eat on Bart or leave my trash behind!"
1184,1,"Jan 22, 2016","FARE EVADERSIn light of the recent fare increase, I get quite irritated when I see a fare evader.  I see it occur about 3 times per week.  I see this crime so often that I now can tell when someone is about to evade the fare by watching their body language.  They begin to look over at where the station agent is located.  Often the station agent is busy/talking to another station agent/distracted/assisting a customer.  The fare evader walks to the turnstile which is located farthest from the station agent, and positions himself very close to the customer in front of him who is in the process of going through the turnstile.  Then the fare evader quickly runs through before or during the seconds that the turnstile gate closes.  Often, the fare evader has a very satisfied look on his face, that he never pays for a BART ride, and never intends to pay again.  Can you imagine how many thousands of dollars BART may be losing?  (And we, the honest people, are paying higher fares for?)  If me, just one person, is seeing the thieves evade the fare at least 3 times per week, there must be many, many more that are unseen.One evening recently at the Pittsburg station, I witnessed another fare evader and decided I had seen enough.  I went up to the station agent, told her what I saw in a loud voice, and pointed to the fare evader.  The fare evader saw me do this.  The station agent did not try to detain him.  She did not announce anything on the speaker system.  As I was leaving the station, the fare evader followed me and told me that he ""was tired of people like me doing things to his people.""  I assumed he was trying to make my reporting of his crime to the station agent into a racial issue (I am white; he was black.)  He kept following me so I turned around and yelled as loudly as I could, asking for someone to call BART police.  After 15 seconds of my screaming, he wandered away and got on a bus.  I called BART police myself, but they never appeared.One time I asked a station agent about the prevalence of these fare evaders.  He told me the following:  ""the Board of Directors at BART have instructed us to not to do anything about it.""Twice, I have called the ""Comments and Complaints"" phone line to voice my concern about this, and asked what is BART's policy on dealing with the fare evaders.  I asked if they could please return my call.  I have never heard back from BART.  That phone line is: 510- 464-7134.EATING AND DRINKING ON TRAINSBART has signs posted in the stations and inside the train cars prohibiting eating and drinking.  It is announced on the speaker system via a recorded message, and the consequence when caught is a $250 fine.  Yet there are a good number of people who ignore the rules.  I wouldn't care so much about this normally - but I have realized how these rule breakers can actually cause a danger to other passengers.  When liquids are spilled on the floor, passengers can slip and fall.  I was in the same car as a woman who spilled her coffee right before the train departed the station.  Then I observed how the coffee ""traveled"" all over the floor of the car, expanding further each time the train stopped and began moving again.On my trip each morning, the train begins to become very crowded, especially at the MacArthur station.  I see people carrying tall, hot, paper cups of coffee.  They are standing up holding the coffee, and they are positioned extremely close to other passengers.  If the train comes to a sudden stop (which happens often), and if that hot coffee spills on fellow passengers, then doesn't BART recognize the potential lawsuit(s)?Additionally, scraps of food, ketchup, mustard, and other food items are seen on the seats, even in the morning, when you would think that the trains should have been cleaned prior to the morning commute.  Shells from nuts and seeds, chips, Cheetos, open cans of soda, and water bottles roll on the floor."
1185,4,"Apr 30, 2008","Why do you guys trash BART? I must agree about the following:It is expensive.Some people's faces make me want to be blind.Some loud voices make me want to be deaf.Some perfumes make me want to have Michael Jackson's nose-cover.Is there a sign reading ""NO FOOD, NO DRINKS ... except if you are really desperate for your morning coffee and your blueberry muffin. Don't worry about the crumbs, we know your blueberry muffin is clean. Don't worry about the spills, coffee is better than pee!""That homeless guy on the back seat of the car is cool. He is sleeping like a baby, so cute! He deserves to be laying down on two seats. The poor guy is tired. I won't ask him to sit up either. That grandma standing up in the aisle should give him a little space. She is so annoying standing there, doing nothing, just wobbling to the left and to the right, to the front and to the back. There are handles everywhere to grab on to anyway. She is probably faking being old. She can stand fine, faker! There are too many pee stains but once again, Grandma is probably the culprit, the homeless guy passed out wouldn't do that. Crack make you sleepy, not incontinent, right? Perfect! The sign was right: that lady is covering the pee stains with her coffee!But let's get realistic:It is even more expensive to drive into the city.You can -but shouldn't- play Sudoku or read the papers while driving.BART is convenient for most commuters.It is very punctual except twice a year when it is a nightmare.There are no professional clowns on BART... but there are always funny people to watch or some happy ghetto conversations to listen to. It is important to be in touch with our time: some watch MTV or VH1 for the latest vulgar update. I ride BART! Once a week I get my 15-minute lesson on ghetto talk. I get to learn what my teacher's friends did to her, and how she is going to f&*#ing do all those things to them. Last week was ""How to pronounce the c-word"". Our teacher made sure we understood. She repeated it about 20 times. She is a great teacher and can really get the class to pay attention. That class was a special promotion: everyone in the car got to attend the class. The kids too! It was awesome!As a young man I always get a seat. I observe and choose my spot and my target, like a lion picking the sickest and weakest wildebeest, then a little push, a little intimidation with a light frown and of course, my i-pod on my ears. One quick acceleration, and I pass my victim. Once I have positioned myself in front of the seat, I slow down, I look at the LOOSER, give him a little smirk and  -very carefully- sit down. ""Sorry? what 's that? a ""jerk""? Hey, look at who's standing and all pissed off... the LOOSER!""All real men ride on BART. Real men are not gentlemen, they're tough men, strong men. There's nothing gentle about them. They will teach you how stupid it is to get up and give up your seat for a lady or an elderly person who will probably spend their day eating Cheetos behind their desk or watching a ""Murder she wrote"" marathon in their rocking chair anyway. They can stand, it is good for them. They should actually thank us, the real men!BART is great. Better to be in a grumpy mood altogether than alone in a car! At least we Barters (homeless crackheads, ladies, grandmas and real men) love to share and save the Earth!"
1186,1,"Oct 28, 2009","The worst Public Transit system I've ever been on (and I've been on many). I spent the day in San Francisco on my way home from Korea (I live on the East Coast). It was my first time in San Francisco. I had spent almost 2 weeks in Seoul (my first time in Asia) and was able to negotiate around on their public transportation system with NO problem. It was cheap and amazingly clean. Probably the best system I ever had the pleasure to use. And then came BART. It was ridiculously expensive, inefficient and confusing. Signage was awful. We had to constantly bother strangers to ask for help and many of them didn't have any idea where they were going either. I'll never ride the thing again. I fear for America's infrastructure. We're looking more and more like a run down amusement park."
1187,2,"Nov 1, 2009","I'm going to review a couple things about BART but first let's all get this straight.  BART is an intercity transit system meaning it services within the Bay Area and BETWEEN the cities held within, not within one specific city (an intracity.)  So to compare BART to MTA (NYC) or any other metropolitan isn't fair.  They're different, get over it.However, BART could and SHOULD be offering a monthly pass, a weekly pass, student discounts.  Senior citizens are offered discounts but come on, what senior citizen would want to ride BART?I'd take BART more, but some, and by some I mean A LOT, of the stations in the more 'rural' areas (coughcoughGLENPARKcoughcough) don't have an adequate parking lot.  Yea, it can park about 30-40 cars (i haven't counted).  But do you have any clue to what's going on here?!  MUNI sucks, so I'll drive to the BART station, I can cross the bay via BART, but where am I to leave my car?!  Seriously, build a freakin' parking GARAGE.  The BART Union is screwing you (not literally, I hope...)  BART employees are, on average, paid more than any other public transit agency in the Bay Area's, if not state or country's.  Don't believe me?Look at HOW much they get paid.http://www.contracostatimes.com/bart-salaries?appSession=119203790762726&RecordID=&PageID=2&PrevPageID=2&cpipage=1&CPIsortType=asc&CPIorderby=TotalReally?! Are you guys retarded?""...2 people to replace a cushion on a BART train, and some BART employees make more in overtime than they do in regular salary...""http://sfist.com/2009/06/23/bart_workers_to_strike_july_1st.phpStop using the CalTrain fare system as your model.  Also, you're in debt, BIG TIME.  Stop screwing the public for you're exaggerated salaries, incompetent employees and Bay Area Rapid Transit:D"
1188,4,"Aug 16, 2010","BART rapidly became my favored way of getting around the City -- for an out-of-towner it was a lot easier to figure out than Muni.  Occasional panhandlers hang around to hit you up when you're getting tickets, and I was told to avoid the Civic Center Station, so I did.  Otherwise, I had no trouble getting from my hotel in the Mission district to downtown tourist destinations.  One side goes north; the other goes south -- and all trains stop at all the stations in the City.  It couldn't be easier."
1189,3,"May 13, 2011","Oh, where to begin.  The three stars say so little.  First, BART is on time.  I have only very rarely been inconvenienced by a slow-down in traffic on BART, and almost ALWAYS inconvenienced by traffic when driving in SF.  And let's not get started about parking.   Second, I have not had the dismal experiences with fellow passengers described by some of the other yelpers; in fact, I find my fellow BART passengers endlessly fascinating, especially when the entire Raider Nation gets on in Richmond.  (OK, there have been a couple of very smelly, scruffy, out-of-it persons with whom one would prefer not to share an upholstered BART seat.  And suspicious substances on said seats.  But not as a general rule.)   I believe in BART, especially in principle.BUT.  I used to live in NYC, so I know what a working mass transit system looks like. And I can say the following:BART is too expensive.   It should be cheaper AND have more trains and cars so that we would have MORE riders at lower prices.  As is, lots of folks prefer to drive for understandable reasons, which sucks.  BART is not sufficiently extensive within the city of San Francisco and/or not sufficiently linked to MUNI.  The whole BART/MUNI disconnect can ruin your experience of public transit in the Bay Area.  BART is great for suburban commuters to downtown, but a fail when it comes to the city.BART should run 24 hours.  I say this as a person who lives along a BART line and experiences BART noise at close range.  It should run 24 hours so that a person can actually use it to get to the airport at dark o'clock.  So that people who work late or party late (especially those who party late and imbibe mind-altering substances) can get home safely.BART should have better signage for its stations.  A person new to town is lucky to figure out where the heck s/he is with those dimly lit stations and tiny, subtle station signs.  Still, I believe in public transportation, and at least people ride on BART, which is more than I can say for the subway in LA.  Go BART."

1191,1,"Mar 8, 2012","Worst rail transit I have experienced overall. The station name is posted in the smallest letters I have ever seen for a station. The station announcing is vague and low, blurred by the huge (I mean it. It's freaking loud!) noise. There is no visual notice of location and stations. In addition, why the hell it doesn't reach south bay? Overall, it sucks!"
1192,5,"Aug 16, 2012",What's there not to like about BART??? Bart gets you to where you need to go in reasonable time with fair prices (except those leaving SFO).I don't know how'd i'd get around if it weren't for Bart. BART is the greatest invention since sliced bread .I love Bart and i hope it loves it me too.
1195,5,"Dec 15, 2013","Yeah. I like this one. I get to check in to Bart Tube on Foursquare and why not have it on Yelp. Frankly, it probably is on Yelp but shows in no searches so here it is. The world famous underwater bay area rapid transit tube. I have been through it a million times and frankly is just fine. It is very noisy and I like to complain about cellphone service. Since it costs a fortune to have cellphones and ""technically"" service is available and good would it not make sense to have consistent and reliable service in there? I hate cellphone use in the tube. TMO never worked. Of recent use I hated Sprint. Data never worked when trains moved unless you were locked in a signal at a station. Sprint is gone bye bye and now ATT? Sucks. The curse of the tunnels? Fix it. Damn it. Half of discretionary income of all stupid people with no income goes to cellphone bills and does not work when there is nothing to do and want to use it! The tunnel is good however. It is long, dark and open. Trains go very fast and everyone sort of falls sleep as soon as the tube noise rises. Is very good tube. I recommend it. 15 Dec 2013"

1197,3,"Jan 29, 2010","If there are BART stations located near where you are and where you need to go, BART is a decent form of public transit.  But some things about it just stink:- Literally. Upholstered seats, and carpeted floors?  Whose bright idea was that?  Whatever color they were originally, they are now splotches of yellowish greenish brown.  And the cars smell.  A redo of the interiors to something more modern and practical is long overdue.- I swear they must be purposefully hiring people who speak English as unintelligibly as possible, and then give them training in mumbling in their own imaginary language, to make the station announcements.- The ticket machines are outdated and not very user friendly."
1198,1,"Jun 8, 2011","As an advocate for the environment, I have always supported BART, but  no longer. Last  night we took BART to the U2 concert. We exited the train at Coliseum BART to be greeted by multiple signs exclaiming that BART would be closed at midnight. Planning ahead, we sadly left early, our ears straining for every note. When we arrived at the pedestrian bridge linking the stadium and BART we found it packed with thousands of people and two measly 4 car trains visible waiting on the platform. Historically I have taken BART to concert events. They had two years advance notice of this sold out concert and they made no preparations to accommodate the needs of the  riders. Thousands were left stranded. We were lucky. We only rode one stop and were 18th in line for a taxi."
1199,1,"Jun 23, 2011",BART sucks! The trains are always being delayed because of some technical failure. There's always a psycho causing a disturbance on the train. They jack up the fare constantly. It cost $3.10 now to get from downtown SF to downtown Oakland. Why so much for such crappy service.
1200,2,"Jan 27, 2012","BART is pretty much a so/so transit agency for me, and there a few pro's and cons to take into consideration about them. First the good things  The trains are regular enough (more regular then most of the buses I have to wait on) and you have the added benefit of not worrying about traffic. There is also the fact that you pay depending on how far you travel, so if you want to only go a couple of stops you end up paying a rather cheap fare.  They are on Twitter so you can see if there are any delays, this isn't the most reliable thing, but I appreciate the effort none-the-less Now the bad things.  The trains are absolutely filthy, especially those horrible fabric seats that are covered with stains (don't want to even think of their origin). These same seats are often covered in a myriad of trash, mainly in the form of newspapers, which makes traveling on BART a not very pleasant experience.  Stations and their surrounding areas are not that well lit at night, which means I avoid traveling through them after dark if  I can. Especially the Fruitvale station which is the one I use most regularly. You'd think with all the money they have they could afford to put more lights up. Panhandlers are regular sights on both trains and their surrounding areas, more recently people have started trying to sell off tickets brought with stolen credit cards. This makes walking into a station an occasionally nerve wracking experience. The announcements for next stops on the train are often very muffled, which makes it hard to know which stop is coming up ... It worries me as I'd hate to think of the confusion and chaos that would occur during an natural disaster, or if some other emergency situation where to occur.  The worst for me is that air conditioning in some of the trains doesn't work in the summer. Being in a train, crowded with people, and no opportunity to open a window really is the pits."
1201,3,"Feb 21, 2012","Bart system is OK and really help full in San Francisco, but comparing to other cities in the world, if we take Paris as an example it has a lot to improve. Usually Bart will be on time, but it has lots of cons. The train is not clean and I am usually feel sick after riding Bart. The fares are high and keep getting higher from year to year. The biggest con of the Bart that it stops at midnight, which is not very helpful if you want to come to SF on the weekend and drink. I am sure that Bart could save lots of people's lives if they could take the Bart at 2:00AM and wouldn't have to drive under the influence back to their homes. But, at least we have it. Imagine how would it be to live completely without it....."
1202,1,"Feb 24, 2012","On the way home on BART, my brother visiting from NY realized that by giving me his swipe card with the balance of the $10 he had just purchased in rides, he had also lost his ability to exit the station at Powell St. My bad. I should have caught it. I live here. Ok, so we had wine with dinner.Duh.He negotiated a $3 exit with the Station Meister.  Now he has $17 in singles with which to buy future BART cards more exactly.You would think that BART would take advantage of all of the software smarts in the area to devise vending machines that either make change or allow people to buy more convenient amounts on their swipe cards.  After all, London can manage that -- and it is not a city renowned for its software industry.  But then again, the BART vending software likely was designed in 1975 by a transit system functionary, before software took off in these parts.Will that card he gave me ever be usable since it has an unused, open exit on it?  Can you have 2 entrances, if you did not have a proper exit?  Seems like a question for Kafka."
1203,3,"Mar 7, 2012","Bart is pretty good for getting anywhere in the south city or in the immediate San Francisco area. The trains are kinda old though on the inside and the seats are torn up a little. Also if you live on the peninsula, you have to go to Millbrae or a farther station."

1207,2,"Nov 20, 2009",Yeah bart is cool if you only need to ride it during the day. When you need to ride it during the evening or maybe you work nights then you are shit out of luck.

There are about 500 businesses open until 2am everyday.I am a chef and on several occasions I have had to run full speed for 10 blocks because the last train to the east bay leaves civic at 12:20.

1213,3,"Jan 25, 2006","I want to take a pot shot at BART too.  I think BART is a great idea in general. Its fairly clean, convenient regional transit.  However, I have one glaring issue with this new Millbrae transit center and SFO spur which is set up all wrong.  You can't long-term park in the BART parking lot, so what is the use of having a spur to SFO if you can't park your car?  You can't even park overnight on weekends when most people are taking their trips. What are you supposed to do, park a half mile away in some residential area or take your chances in a strip mall lot and ride your skateboard over to BART with your luggage foisted on your back?  That makes no sense. I thought the whole idea was to provide a convenient alternative to the other airport transit options and to reduce traffic congestion?  They need to fix that and provide at least one parking deck exclusively for long-term and overnight parking."
1214,2,"Aug 31, 2011","I live in the DC area and use Metro on a daily basis. I've also used the public transit in NYC, Boston, and Las Vegas (if that even counts). We took the yellow line from SFO to Concord. Similar to DC, the lines are color coded and it was easy to figure out where to go. At $10.25 per person for one-way fare, it was double what I was used to paying at home (for going the same distance). The cloth seats were a bit worn, the cars were dirty, and it had a strange smell. The ride to Concord was fine--the trains are a bit jerky and it is noisier going through tunnels compared to home. They utilize more cars (10 versus 8/6 back home). It was hard to hear the driver over the PA as well. We spent a few days in SF during our trip and even though there was a station near our hotel, it was just easier to walk or take the car to wherever we needed. If I lived in SF, I would probably utilize the buses more than the rail."
1215,2,"Jul 30, 2008","Okay, this review is based on my most recent experience on the Richmond to Fremont line.  Just when you think you've seen it all on Bart!  I have been grossed out on Bart many, many times, but I have never had the urge to vomit, until today!  WTF?  It's bad enough that this line gets the crappiest, dirtiest and smelliest of the trains still in service.  So, here I am just minding my own business trying to get home, etc.  I was seated in the first benched seat next to the window.  Yay, I'm almost to San Leandro!  Next thing I know, three chicks sit down and triangle me in, fine.  Yeah, fine until the one sitting next to me reached over and began popping pimples on the woman's face sitting directly in front of us.  Gross, I'm freaking gagging just thinking about it.  It's disgusting enough to think of these wackos doing this in a more discrete location, but on Bart, in front of other (normal) riders, and putting an innocent victim in projectile pimple juice's way?!  They had the nerve to give me a dirty look for getting grossed the hell out, getting up, standing next to the doors and staring at them in disgust?  I hope you come across this post!  You should be ashamed of yourselves!  YUCK!!"

Hey BART, you have millions of millions of dollars and you are not capable to inspecting the ties the rails rest on?  You also cannot make the necessary repairs during the night when trains are not operating?  BART is a completely mismanaged organization.  Complete incompetence.  Stations are dirty.  Trains are dirty.  Tracks are apparently poorly maintained and unsafe.  Employees are rude.  Escalators cannot seem to be repaired timely either.  Horrible!!!!!"

I like BART for the most part, BUT:1.  the employees are always rude, rude, rude, even when I am nice, nice, nice;2.  the inside of trains are alwayas dirty dirty dirty even though fares keep going up, up up3.  i seem to have to keep waiting 15 minutes or more for a train to come, guess that is my fault for not checking the schedule, but it seems like they would have more trains, especially on weekends and nights4.

1223,4,"Feb 12, 2015","I've never really understood why people despise BART so much. I've read all the negative reviews, and I think they are all founded upon unstable arguments. Here's what I have to say. I used to drive everywhere. I loved driving, and I never even thought about taking public transportation due to such bad comments about it. But, I decided to give it a shot and started becoming a regular rider. The interior is always clean, the seats just got replaced from cloth to vinyl, and in my experience, the trains have been on time. The only problem I have is the expensive fare. I can go the same distance on muni round trip for less. That's just inner SF.. I do think the fares going long distance are a little steep. But i've learned to be okay with it, considering I can relax going into the city, not worrying about traffic, and scrambling for parking. I really don't know why the negativity arises. I think it is pure overreaction. Love BART!"
1224,2,"Apr 9, 2015","Boarded the SF Airport train at Rockridge yesterday morning needing to go to Milpitas.  Floor of the car had the usual sticky, dried up stains from spilt drinks.  Not surprising since I could as usual see a number of passengers holding drinks that they had brought aboard.I transferred at Glen park and sat in the front of the lead car facing towards the rear.  At San Bruno a traveller struggling with two large suitcases and a large Coke in a paper cup got on but it was too much to handle and the paper cup hit the floor right away forming a small lake with ice in the middle.  The traveller cursed his luck in Italian and as the train accelerated from the station rivulets of soda and ice from the spill streamed in the direction opposite of travel.  People who were paying attention shifted their feet around to avoid getting caught up in the tide.As we braked into Milpitas, the ice flow reversed direction towards the cab but it trickled out finally.  It was a relief to get off.Why does BART permit drinking on the trains?"
1225,4,"Sep 6, 2007","I love bart, I love it.  I love not driving or worrying about parking. Any hardships faced by the riding Bart pale in comparison to driving.  I love people watching on Bart.  I dislike the deplorable condition of some of the trains and some of sketchy ass people I come across but hey that is life.  I think they could improve security and cleanliness of the trains but you have got to take the good with the bad.  I do think they should have more trains, and run them all night long but this will come in time.  If I was a billionaire I would give the bay area the gift of a bart extension that goes all over the bay.  I cannot believe that it does not go to the south bay yet. Perhaps in time.  Also, I think that they should consider having commuter only trains.  The more you ride the nicer train you have access to.  Perhaps a dining car?  Or maybe even one with nicer seats?  All I know is that the chodes that ride on spare the air day or when XYZ bridge shuts down really piss me off.  They do not know where the hell they are going, and have no sense of etiquette."
1226,1,"May 25, 2011","What's the deal with 3 car trains? And they always park center stage so people have to sprint from opposite corners not to miss it. Most of the toilets are grotesque and reserved for dire emergencies, if they are open at all. Most people behind the glass windows are gravy trainers who barely budge or listen to you when you talk to them. And the funniest part? Some of the conductors announce over the mike, ""Thank you for choosing Bart."" Yeah, like what other rapid transit choice do I have??"
1227,1,"Aug 5, 2013","This is the most expensive transit system in human history. Wages are the highest in the industry and benefits are outrageous. Management is bloated and overpaid. It sucks blood out of the economy with a regional sales tax. And it takes BART *DECADES* to put rails down to a new area. Over 30 years after it came into existence, it still doesn't serve the southbay. They have terribly expensive rail cars from France, which keep breaking down. And the fares are too high. Lousy deal all around."
1228,2,"Jan 15, 2015","Riding Bart is a crap shoot.  You never know if it'll be on time or have mechanical problems, medical emergencies, track maintenance issues, or public disturbances."
1229,1,"Mar 16, 2015","My first review was when I started using Bart, and I was balanced and gave it like 3 stars. I was also inexperienced with it. I took it for about three years or so after that and it ended up being one of the worst public transit systems I've ever experienced. Overcrowded constantly, poor A/C, gross, and just not up to the demand of how many people need it. It has all kinds of problems. People would pass out from the overcrowding. The stations were havens of bum pee and intravenous drug injectors and worse. If you want to experience a waking nightmare, check out Bart on a bad day, which they have at least three times or more a week. I now use MARTA (Metro Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority or something) and it's far better: cleaner, more polite and sane people, better views, mostly reliable, and -- despite criticisms to the contrary -- it has a lot of stops inside the Atlanta perimeter (ITP). Once I started using MARTA -- which isn't perfect; nothing is -- I realized how poor Bart really is. You'll find Bart is a third world experience for first world prices. It's seriously equivalent to India or Japan's public transit. Avoid Bart if you can, if you seek reliability, cleanliness, sanity, and comfort."

1236,1,"Mar 6, 2014","It was my 1st time in years to take Bart. I went frm Daly City to SF and back. Daly city has several structures where parking has to be done. I gave the Bart employee in his booth (he was totally free at that time) my parking space no and asked which of the structures I must climb. He refused abusively and said ""you should know where you parked and shouldn't be asking me"". I told him it was my 1st time ever at Daly City Bart, but he refused help. I am a senior citizen and have never complained before, but I sent a complaint to Bart today."
1237,3,"Jun 8, 2005","I have a really hard time quantifying my feelings about BART, so understand that ""3 stars"" represents a compromise between many conflicting feelings that can lean any way on any given day.  Here are my main thoughts on the subject.  Despite being corrected about my earlier assertion that BART is a private for-profit company (tip o' th' pin to Andrew S for the heads-up), the fact remains that--for whatever mysterious reason--BART is outrageously expensive.  It's just embarrassing to go back east and ride Boston's rail system, for example, which will take you anywhere the rails go for a buck.  Period.  Doesn't matter how far you go or whether you have to transfer to another line.  It's just a buck.  On the other hand, it's true that, for the most part, BART is pretty clean and timely and efficient.  In this congested part of the world, with some of the stupidest and most outrageous traffic I've ever seen, sometimes BART is simply the way to go--especially for one-time or occasional events.  I was also initially vexed by the very limited service offered by BART, but this is a complex region for any one transit system to cover by itself, and with MUNI and Caltrain around, no one system has to.  You just have to get used to the idea of combining multiple transit systems to get where you need to, and then weigh that option against the pros and cons of driving...and parking.  Ugh, don't get me started on *that*."
1238,3,"Sep 21, 2007","BART is great for a lot of things...not so much trying to get home from the city drunk after 12:50am. WHY DOESN'T BART RUN UNTIL AT LEAST 3am?!!! I would use it every weekend, seriously. It would be amazing if it ran a little later at night. It gets 3 stars for just being BART and mostly providing reliable service for the majority of the bay area. Marin County could use it, but that's a marin issue and not a BART issue. I guess they're too good for BART or something.  BART isnt very clean, but it's about what I'd expect for mass public transportation.  The station agents have been hit or miss. Either they're helpful if you have a question, or when you come up to them they give you a ""what the fuck do you want?"" kind of attitude. My bad, didn't mean to make you do your job.  BART would totally get 5 stars if they were open late enough to let me get my drink on in the city and then transport me back to Walnut Creek....maybe one of these days."
1239,2,"May 23, 2005","I doubt that there is a perfect public transit system anywhere in the world.  And I wonder what the hell BART is talking about when it proudly advertises that it was voted the #1 public transit in the country.  First of all, in a major metropolitan area with plenty of night life, it's a travesty that the last train leaves the terminus at midnight.  This discourages people from taking BART or going out altogether, or worse yet, some people may decide to drink and drive.  Second, it costs over $6 roundtrip from the East Bay to SF, much higher than comparable trips on a lot of other US public transit systems, and more expensive than in Japan where the cost of living is way higher.  Third, they keep cutting back on the staff and the train length because of budget cuts--one time, my ticket got stuck in the fare machine, and I had to wait for 45 minutes for an agent to show up and retrieve it for me.  At least it wasn't an emergency, but what if you DID have an emergency?  And finally, it's just insane or stupid or both to have carpeted and upholstered cars!  Some cars stink of yesteryear's spilled latte...and how much of the shrinking budget is being spent on cleaning or replacing the cloth interior?  And they're talking about raising the fares again.  YEAH, RIGHT."

I know that if i lived in the bay area, i'd probably assimilate to taking the BART on a daily basis, and i would probably save $ in the long run. i guess i am basing this review from a 3rd party perspective, as i do not live in the area, but i promise to update this review if i do get one of the jobs in which i interviewed for..."
1242,3,"Jan 3, 2007","I have taken Bart to the airport and into the San Francisco several times. It was a more satisfying experience in the past. I like the convenience of taking Bart but it's really starting to show it's age. The cars aren't very clean, the carpets and seats are starting to turn gray and it's not unusual to find bits of garbage wedged between the seats. Some are starting to smell gross. Also because of the terrible traffic in the Bay Area I think they should expand the line to more locations, like out to Tracy and to more places in San Francisco. The public transit system for the Bay Area really needs work! Still tons of people use Bart everyday so its not surprising they aren't working harder for their money. Also when I ride Bart there are points when it screeches really loudly when going over the track, too loudly to talk. I will continue to take it to the airport as it's more cost affective then driving because of the current gas prices but its not as enjoyable as it could be. I've also gone through the experience of the demagnetized Bart cards and it is a pain to get a new one. The Bart drivers are very nice and I have never had a problem with them. Some of them do mumble the station stops though. Bart should totally clean and update their cars."

I remember being excited like a tourist but fast forward 12 years later it was okay simply because it was cheaper than a cab or Super Shuttle leaving SFO. Plus even for a LA Native, the drivers in San Fran are CrAzY!!!! AND seriously the carpet and cloths seats were bothersome to me. I was disturbed by the thought of the all of the riders through the years, bacteria and the fact that I was wearing a dress. In D.C., LA & NY there are no freakin' cloth seats..who thought this was okay and I KNOW it hasn't be cleaned EVER...but anyway,  I survived, disease free and I'm here to tell the tale."

The first time it was replaced within a week. I was impressed and thankful. The second time Clipper and EZRider each told me to call the other party. They basically had me go in a circle and never sent the replacement card. I mad several calls on seperate days in hopes of talking to someone who could replace the card. They have my money but will not send a replacement card.

It costs too much, the trains are always breaking down, people drive through the parking lots like frickin' maniacs, the cars smell, 1st rainy day always causes delays, it's noisy (especially underwater) etc. etc. etc.  Well, ok, true.  :)  But let's take a step back for a second and think about all the times you've rode to BART flying past commuters jammed into their cars.  Think about the books you've read, the naps you've taken, or just the relaxing view out the window, allowing your brain to turn off as you listen to your ipod while cruising along.  And while you remember the day the system broke down or made you late, if you're a regular how times has it gotten you where you want to go when they said they would?  I've been riding it regularly for three years and have to honestly say it gets me to work and back home again on time at least 95% of the time.  BART is FAR more predictable than driving.  Frankly, that's fine with me.  The main flaw with the system today was that it was designed solely to promulgate suburban development and was viewed more or less as a tool for getting suburbanites to their jobs in the city and then home with a minimum of fuss.  That was the thinking of the day and hence it is the system we have now.  Now, many of those office jobs are in the suburbs and the inner Bay Area is becoming increasingly urbanized.  BART needs to change to meet the times.  More trains for example with some of them being express (meaning they skip through some low density stations like South Hayward).  24 hour service, and doing everything to convert BART parking into housing, jobs, and recreation."

It was strange that each train goes one way, as opposed to taking the L line inbound or out, you just take the richmond line and it only goes out.  Inside, the seats were all fabric!  But, they were too low. I'm short, and my legs felt weird. What about the tall people?  It was much less crowded, which was good, because i had NO IDEA where i was going.  There was nothing to tell you where you were, and i could barely see the signs outside.  At one point, i had to stick my head out of the train to see if i was at berkeley center yet.  When i got out, i discovered i had to pay to leave!! I had just used my muni pass to get in, but i guess that only works for in the city.  I paid the attendant $3.25 and she let me go.  What if i hadn't had it?  Do they keep you on there, like the guy in that boston song the man who never returned?  The way back i had to switch trains, but the connecting one was waiting for me. However, i would have never been able to figure that out for myself.  Some ways i like muni better, but this is probably more reliable.  Bad points for closing early at 12!"
1250,2,"Apr 27, 2006","Why it's called Rapid Transit, I will never know.  As a daily bart commuter, I know first hand that more often than not, BART is always at the very least, 3-5 minutes late.  So for all you newbies, NO your train will not arrive at your station at 3:03.  But if it is on time, the bart will leave your A** even though it sees you running for it.  Yeah, there is the case where you have OVERZEALOUS train operator, who stops for EVERYONE attempting to catch the train, and makes you even later, but that's more an exception, not a rule.  Don't get me started on their ingenious idea about UPGRADING their software during peak commute hours.  Yeah, only the BEST Transit Agency would think of something so customer-centric.  Some BART Stations are definitely better manned than others though.  As a frequent rider from the Richmond station, the station agents don't give a Rat's Derriere about what you do.  People smoke while waiting for the train, whereas at Macarthur Oakland, the Station Agent will get on that speaker and tell you to kill that cigarette.  It serves it's purpose, at the very least.  I arrive home in one peace despite the fact that I'm half awake.  Can't say the same result would happen if I was driving on 80."

So when I have to somehow get from SFO into the city, I was like, do I take a taxi, a shuttle, or a limo?  It didn't even cross my mind to take the BART.  Yeah, right.  I won't even take it if it was just me, and with all my craps (I'm NOT a light packer), there's no way I'm taking it.  Then my friend Susan was like, it's not that bad.  It's so easy, blah, blah, blah.  She sent me the link to the schedule and everything so I was like fine.  Since I was poor due to too much shopping earlier in the month, I was willing to try it.  And it was not that bad!  I got off the plane, got my luggage, took the Air Tram or whatever it's called from the terminal to the BART station.  I had to run so fast, but I made it just in time for the BART.  Bought the ticket (a lil annoying with they way it makes you add the money then minus $1, minus 5 cents, minus 5 cents and all that.  Can't the ticket fee be the exact dollar like $1 or $2 instead of like $1.35 or $2.15 or something lame like that.  Anyways, I got on the BART ok.  The website was definitely helpful cuz it gives me the time that BART was coming (hence the running part), and it also told me which station to get off and how much the ticket will cost me ($6 minus 5 cents, minus 5 cents, minus $5 cents, minus 5 cents).  So definitely check the website out before getting on it.  The only other complain is the stupid speaker/intercom system.  It was so crappy I couldnt' hear what the conductor was saying.  If I hadn't pay attention to the station name and keep track of where I was, I would have been lost and not know where to get off.  But I made it to the city safely...so all was forgiven."
1262,1,"Nov 19, 2008","In the wake of a profound post World War II residential and commercial resettlement, coupled with the consequent elevation in automobile demand, Bay Arians faced an escalating overpopulation of highways and bridges spanning the bay. Thus the BART was born, a system created to deliver the Bay Area to the doorstep of the next generation in public transportation HAAHAHAHA. Wow, really? Did you just read that too? I mean, seriously? Cummmmon!! CUMMMMMMMMON!!! Oh well, back to my point. In today's world, the trend towards highly selective career placement is skyrocketing and companies are forced to draw resources from a wider array of loosely connected cities at all Cardinal points of the Bay Area. In addition, corporatization is replacing the Mom and Pop shops with high rise economic giants and industrial machines staffing millions of ""blue"" and ""white"" collar workers as well as specialized labor in areas where residential limitations restrict the amount of local hiring available. The non feasible solution: double the number of Bay Area bridges from 6 to 12. The more practical solution: expand the Public Transportation system. The Problem: career opportunities have expanded, the population has expanded, technology has expanded, the movement towards a leaner, greener, less carbon, more enviro-friendly society has expanded, but the BART....it hasn't expanded and it is now itself a victim of overpopulation. Unfortunately, I am a number in the system, a sprocket in the machine, a working American plagued by the dilemma of fluctuating gas prices and the possibly devastating effects of green house gasses on the future of our planet.....well the BART actually zips me over traffic and cuts off an hour from my commute home but I do care about the environment too. Though each BART car has its own personality, its own sounds, squeaks, rattles, jars, pungent aromas and creepy BART engineers announcing over the speakers, ""Maaaaaaaac Arthur Station, our nnnnnnnext stop is Maaaaaac Arthur Station, your final traaaaaaansfer point for Freemont bound passengers,"" in a very Charles Manson-ish voice; there is one similar aspect of every BART car that I have come to accept, overpopulation. Every day, millions of numbers, millions of sprockets pile onto the BART telling themselves that they are getting to work while simultaneously saving the environment, assuring that little Billy has green trees to climb when he grows up, but in actuality, they're simply making an effort to save a little gas money and avoid the devastating consumption of the highway system by automobiles and there blaring horns. This overpopulation of the BART system, in essence, creates individual cities within each car. Excessive amounts of people with multiple occupations, cultures and religions pile into an area which, geographically, is ten times too small. BART personalities run rampant: the lotion salesman who sells Dixie cups full of lotion which he pours from a large container with no visible seal guaranteeing you that it was purchased and not made, the struggling musician that paces the overcrowded isles playing guitar gibberish, begging for money and sharing his lifelong story, the bums who only contribute to the already visible aroma and try to pawn stolen BART tickets, and the crazies who yell and scream about things that only themselves in their insanity can understand. Hormones elevate as the competition to attain the best seat, or ""a"" seat plays out, or the elderly and handicapped try to capitalize on their federally assigned seats, and involuntary exchanges of bodily secretions due to the close proximity of fellow passengers occurs. With each stop, more and more sprockets board the vessel shoving you closer and closer to the person behind you, into that small area of space surrounding a human being where you can actually feel their emission of body heat and warm moist expulsions of breath trickling over your skin. The BART has its own set of cultural standards as well. In everyday life, we know our personal boundaries and those of others because they have been engrained into our very existence since our birth. On the BART, different rules apply. Phrases like, ""excuse me,"" or ""Thanks for that taste of arm pit,"" or ""watch where you're sticking that thing,"" are replaced with grunts, groans and tolerant sighs because intolerance is not accepted on rapid transit. The air becomes so thick that you can feel its texture. The only thing that is stopping you from reaching up and grabbing a handful of it is the fear of what you will actually grab, and not having a place to wipe your hand off afterwards. AAAAAUUUUGGGGH!!! DEATH!!!  So as I am gliding over the freeway on an elevated track with my face smashed up against the glass window and three different people breathing down my neck, I sit in envy of the poor bastards stuck in miles of traffic, crawling down the freeway, laying on their horns and cursing the day they were born...I long to feel their misery"
1263,3,"Feb 20, 2010","I took the Bart the first time as I need to get to rockridge from the SF airport.  Went on line but only found the schedule but no help on what line to take or how to go from point A to B.  Unlike some other cities, the website was not too user friendly and it was not friendly to new users.  After I got on the train, I could see that they needed money to upgrade the interior.  Also, there was no map, no announcement to let the passinger know where he was going or what the next stop would be.  I had to struggle and look out the window at each station to try to figure out where I was and when to get off.  Definitely some management attention required to make it more user friendly."
1264,2,"Feb 21, 2013","If you can drive, do it for comfort, speed and ease. If you drive during commute hours, pick up carpooler(s) at many locations in the East Bay and ride through in the carpool lanes on the left and right sides of the toll approach. During the week end, the slog is a lot slower and toll more expensive but driving will guarantee you comfort (you get a seat), reliability (cars seldom break down on the bridge but BART does more often), company (some of the folks on BART are unseemly) and you won' t get robbed or mugged by BART (expensive fares), by shady characters in the train (bags have been stolen from under the seats) or at stations located in less than safe neighborhoods (pretty much anywhere on the BART network since their stations attract that kind of activities). I still ride BART when I have to but I would rather not. I almost forgot about bikes. Expect your space to be taken over by bikes and their riders and your trouser legs to be smeared by dirty tires. Finally, the cosseted and much maligned transit police is seldom to be seen and prefers to ride around in taxpayer-funded cruisers. Service is often interrupted due to ""police activity"", medical emergencies, breakdowns of equipment (quite common, usually during commute hours), etc. Trains are also very noisy and one can risk to become deaf on the long run. Because of a lack of long-term investments with shortsightedness from staff and administrators, new trains are not expected until 2019 at earliest... New seat designs will be inadequate for future riders so be prepared to walk, ride a bike, drive or move to a better city or region because this system has seen the end of its useful life. As for tracks, who knows? They don' t seem to be quite straight and travel through the transbay tube is ""swingy"" due to currents and tides in the bay. Again, do drive and if you want to save money, may I recommend the Smart? It is very economical and has all the benefits of public transit without the inconveniences. Oh and did I mention that BART shuts down at midnight? I know. Stupid, ain' t it? But this is what happens when you live in a 3rd world region."
1265,2,"Jun 21, 2012","One of the worst public transit systems in the Bay Area with AC Transit, it makes you wish you had a car even if you never learned how to drive... It is slow, old, expensive, noisy, crowded, smelly, dirty to filthy, infrequent, breaks down often and repeatedly, and even has a police force that is known for killing its riders. To avoid especially during the weekends when trains are shorter than usual but packed with weekend tourists and their children, bikes, the airport trains are stuffed with luggage, and service is even more infrequent than during the week. So, do yourself a favor and ride carpool as much as you can. You will save money, time, have a seat and it will smell better. Worse of all, it dead-ends at SFO meaning that it will never expand beyond the airport down the Peninsula."
1266,3,"May 7, 2011","I've been riding BART for about 8 months now. It's very cool that it exists, but priorities need to be re-assessed. They're evidently going to waste millions on the seats. How stupid. The seats are OK. As it is now, BART switches to once every 20 minutes on each line (while others just stop running) at something like 7:00 PM. How ridiculous. If they want people to ride instead of drive, give us more trains, more often. Trains should go every 15 minutes (at the most!) at least until 9:00 PM. Right now, huge lines form for the trains at around 7:30 and, if you want a seat, you'd better be there early. This is a big pain. I'd rather sit on less-than-perfect seats and have more trains run."
1267,1,"Mar 1, 2013","I had my suitcase stolen on Feb. 26th at 3:30 pm at the Balboa Park Station. Coming home from SFO after a 5 week trip, I just wanted to get home and had to get off and change trains for Dublin at Balboa Park. As the train approached, I asked someone if this was the correct train (first time traveler from SFO) and when I looked down my suitcase was gone and the dozen or so people who had been standing next to me disappeared, along with my bag. I reported it to security immediately and was told straight away that there was not a surveillance camera on the platform where I stood. There was a tv monitor screen with only 4 views on it, that's it!! He asked if I wanted him to call the police and I said well YES, of course!! A very nice policeman came and took a report and told me I would probably never see it again, and he said that the stealing of phones and laptops among other things is OUT OF CONTROL!!!!!  Bart is not a place where you can stand and place a call to a family or friend without the threat of some thug stealing your stuff!!!! I have traveled all over London on The Underground and trains and busses and NEVER felt unsafe or feared that anyone would take my bags, not that it doesn't happen, but it never happened to me and I used the public transit there everyday. In San Francisco one day and in the very first hour get all my clothing stolen!! And I don't have the money whatsoever to replace my wardrobe. I had my suitcase right by my side and took my eyes off of it for 3 SECONDS, that's all it took. From now on I will only use taxis or drive myself..."
1268,1,"May 23, 2008","Hello, my husband, our two friends, and I are from Sacramento. We have lived here our whole lives and come down to SF about 3 times a year. We came down last weekend and for the first time decided to ride BART. We waited  at Judah and the Ocean station on the Handicapp ramp because I walk with a cane and am disabled. The driver pulled so far away from the ramp that we were all running to catch the train. We got on and then our friend got off and we did not know why. We saw him walking to the front of the train, then back to us but the doors closed and he was left behind. His wife was freaking out because she had all his belongings and he has MS and she was just frantic. We sat there calming her down, trying to figure why he got off the train. She finally saw the very small sign that said that you had to purchase your tickets in the first car. There were no signs at the station or anything telling us to get on the first train. There was nothing written on the outside of the train and the sign in the car that said to go to the first train was the size of the palm of my hand and that is it!. We figured why her husband got off, he was getting tickets because he saw the sign. About that time one of the Security Officers boarded the train. She was about 5""10, African American, and about 165 lbs. She asked if we had our tickets and I personally relayed the whole story to her. She got really rude and had a extremely unprofessional attitude. She asked us all individually what happened and it felt like an interrigation. She made us show her our IDS and said that she would ""Give us the benefit of the doubt"" and ""issue us a citation, this time"" with a warning. She wanted my husband to run train to train at the stops to get to the front of the car and then work his way back to us with the tickets since I am disabled and I could not do it. We were not going to let our only man we had left leave us, so at the next stop we got off the train. When the next train arrived we got in the front of the train and bought tickets and there in the car was my friends husband and the rude, unprofessional, and just plain unfriendly officer. She said ""Well, looks like you found your husband."" And he pulled out all the tickets he had bought for us and showed her. Then she proceeded to check all of our tickets that we just purchased and then two seconds later the other officer checked them again!!! It was our first time riding BART and I guarantee we will NEVER ride it again!!!! We are middle class AMERICANS, tourists and nice easy going people and that was one of the most aggrivating, un-called for, bad experiences of our lives."
1271,2,"Feb 26, 2012","I kept reading these reviews first and then decided to throw in something that's not part of any review here.  I used to take bart for couple of jobs in san francisco for a bit.   They're very timely.  On the other hand, unlike CALTRAIN they're filthy.  Atleat caltrain made the right choice of using trash cans and vinyl seats.     I had couple of friends visit from Europe and were really disgusted how bad and smelly it was compared to their public transit rails in europe.  And they being in U.S and specially san francisco couldn't believe how smelly and bad it was.   The worst thing that happens to the BART is by the homeless and pan handlers who don't shower for months and sit on them.  Oh My!  Couple times I remember getting on BART and then sat down and smelled a stench that was horrible. This time,  I could barely breath.  Then I noticed half the car was empty except for one big filty homless lady at the corner of the empty area and some people on the other corner crowded together.  I was in the middle closer to the empty corner and realized the horrendous rotting smell was coming from the filthy homeless lady 10 seats down!!! And forced all the passengers to crowd together for a breath of fresh air.    I tried to act as if I was sick having a cold and can't smell anything to overcome my embarassment of not figurring this out to begin with and move to a corner or the next crowded car!     I think I was successful for about 3 mins or so and felt like throwing up and bolted into the next car and then the one after that.  WHEW!  Now the really funny , sad and disgusting part is that imagine that person who takes that seat when it's empty and thinking , what in the world is that smell.   Now I only ask to take this example and apply it pretty much to most of the seats in BART.   EWWWWWW!!!!!   That was the last time I took BART.   Thankfully as I'm in south bay /peninsula I try to take caltrain if needed.  I never see such packed crowds in caltrain, the have ameneties, you can drink , eat, plug in your laptop and have desks to work.  BART sucks except for the fact they're on time for most part. Few things BART should do to begin with.  Add more cars during commute hours!  Place trash cans, use Vinyl or hard seats (like VTA rails).   So every week all you need to do is just hose it down."
1272,5,"Apr 15, 2012",Love Bart it saves me gas and time. All I have to do is sit and relax till I reach my stop.
1273,1,"Oct 13, 2010","Is confusing. The website doesn't go into great detail. The pay machine is confusing.  I asked the lady who worked at the bart a question and she told me to ask her behind the glass window in rude voice. However, she stepped out and answered the question for a male who was infront of me. I was so upset, that I became stern with her..It makes me mad thinking of her actually..As a first time user of the bart, I was appalled at how rude and unhelpful the staff where there. The what seemed tourists at the station were more helpful and friendly.I felt confused with the set up. However, the color coding of different lines was good. I guess it gets easy over time..I have taken the tube (train) in london and metro (in montreal) and have found their systems to be more organized, helpful and friendly. In london, the tube workers at the station were not pissed off if you tried to ask them direction questions..I had a bad impression of the city after my upsetting bart experience..However, I went back to SF and rode the bus etc. and it was much better.."
1274,2,"Mar 23, 2015","WARNING: I rode the BART from Oakland Airport to the Embarcadero in SF while en route to see our grandkids in Marin. The new Airport-Oakland link deserves 5 STARS. It is as good as any Euro train I've ridden. The Oakland-Embarcadero train reminds me of the NYC subway system under David Dinkins. BART's cars are dingy, it's windows are covered in an ugly yellow haze. The BART experience is like that of a Communist Country. Then, their are its outriders. At Fruitvale Station two black males entered our car. One was over six feet, muscular, and threatening. This male stood in the middle of the car and in a loud voice announced he needed financial assistance with some kind of payment. He made claims about being a veteran. I'm a veteran I was ashamed. When no one opened their wallets he became menacing and repeated his demand for help. One or two passengers opened their wallets. The other black male was smallish, wore dark sun glasses, and a black hoodie covering his head. He was wearing headphones and walked through the passenger car with a gangsta lope. I felt vulnerable and because I had no weapon - defenseless. If the above two characters were allowed free range then more will follow. BART is on the verge of lawlessness.  Policing needs to be increased! ""ALL LIVES MATTER"""
1275,1,"Jul 27, 2015","First time using this going from Daly City to Embarcadero.  First, couldn't find station from freeway - no signs to encourage people to use it?  Impossible to figure out how to pay for parking (sign says pay at 'Pay Area' without telling you where it is).  Machines to buy tickets require you to spend 20 minutes figuring out how to buy four tickets to go to Embarcadero (not fun when you've got a line of people behind you).  On the way back, couldn't find the station at Embarcadero till I saw people going down stairs so I gave it a try.  Then stood in line to buy tickets but would take cash or ATM only.  Finally a person told me where to go to use a credit card.  Why no signs to tell me that?  Filthy stations, lack of helpful information to use the system, topped by nasty look from employee when I didn't know what to do with my ticket because the styles were all open.  Major negative experience.  Only works for people who have already learned the system and are willing to endure the stink."

1278,4,"Feb 22, 2007","it was an a typical day going home.  i fell into an odd state of defeat. or guilt. or something i didn't quite care for and entered an estranged state of mind.  i embarked myself on a home bound train and became the only person in my entire bart car.  i stood listening to my ipod and reading my book.  it wasn't my book.  i was standing there alone leaning against the pole with my elbow propped up and eyes glued to the pages.  i tried very hard to make reading my only existence to escape what could possibly be around me.  i concentrated, and not because of my mood, or that i was using it as a distraction, but because it was the single most remarkable dialog to ever be written and offered to me.  ever.  i didn't want to get off the train.  the empty car rocked but it was a smooth ride. i wanted to ride until the end of the line.  it never stopped.  the capsule swallowed me and sped on the tracks.  entering the east bay, it looked stormy but it was a mere facade.  speeding by, if the doors behind me opened up, my body would fold and be sucked backwards by a vacuum of swirling air, and then i would fan out, disentangle, and cartwheel through the open air!  the conductor was just a voice in my head, convincing me not to take it to the end.  'get off at your stop, while you can and not have the long journey home.'  but i retorted, 'but i like this, i want to be here alone. why won't you let me? i don't want to go home yet.'  his best argument was sheer silence. i couldn't fight it.  again, i felt defeated.  it was an underground travel now.  i closed my book.  it wasn't my book.  i straightened my neck, put the back of my head against the pole, shut my eyes, and it was more of just me with myself and it was heaven.  i was reflecting on and off of all that was shaded and indistinct.  bart gently forced me off as it came to a slow roll and i stepped onto the platform outside of my flying haven at ""my stop.""  i sighed as i walked toward the stairs gliding up them touching only every third step with one foot.  leaving the station, i scowled at the recorder player and had to face the outside world again with my keys in my hand."
1279,5,"Apr 6, 2010","While I have no complaint about BART It gets me where I want to go, I do want to comment on its customer service. In January I was going down the escalator in BART and when I got to the bottom, my off white jacket and light green gloves were full of grease. Yuk! I went to the station agent and asked what to do. I was given a piece of paper and told to put in a claim. I did. I got a letter from BART telling me to contact the adjuster. When I did called them they had no idea about my case and had, in fact lost my case file. The gentleman said he would call me back. He didn't. I called him and they still hadn't found my file. Then two days later I got a nasty note from BART telling me to get a lawyer. I am so upset I don't know what to do. But I do know that I do not deserve to be treated this way I hope BART reads this. I don't think I should be expected to get a lawyer for a ruined coat and gloves."

I was parked there at 11:00am and a citation was given at 1pm. I figured the person who gave me the citation either got the # wrong, didn't check that I had paid or something was screwed up. In any case, I went online to appeal the citation. Don't think they even bothered to check if my claim was legit. They just sent me a letter 8 weeks later saying the claim is denied, the ticket is upheld with no explanation of why it was upheld nor why they ticketed me to begin with. I requested a second appeal which was also denied also with no explanation. I even sent them copies of my parking receipt to no avail. Now to try and resolve this $40 ticket they want me to pay a $20 processing fee and take a day off of work to appear in court. What nonsense. They probably expect people to just give up and they can earn their extra income on a bogus ticket. I'm sure they don't actually bother looking at these claims. They probably just ignore it until the person really makes the effort to get people in a room to discuss."

(1) they are stilling people's money , by damaging their metro cards on purpose !!! In the Busses and subway train station machines !! All that is happening from one reason only that people would buy another card , and another one , and if you send your damaged card to them ? they taking the card and say goodbye to your card and to your money !!! For example in the last six months , I buy in the beginning of the month , a monthly unlimited metro card , pay 127$ !!! And already twelve times I purchased the same card again and again , I mean in a six months !!! why ? Because suddenly and surprisingly the card after two weeks or so is damaging !!! So you guys probably asking how come ? And why every card ?? So I'll say /ask the same question to you !! How come every time a different card in a different trains and buses of MTA damaging after two weeks or sometimes after one week ?? And if it's happening to me , who can tell me how many people in NY , it's happening to them also in the same way ?? And I don't play with the card or use it in not appropriate way , like throw it like a garbage in places that would damage the card !! No No !! it comes out of the wallet in the morning , I use it in the bus and the train and it goes back to the wallet !!! No games with the card !! But any it gets damaged !!! And every month after two or three weeks of use !!! I don't get to use it the whole mont !!! And I use it only two times in a day , on my way to work and when I go back home !!! And I buy Monthly unlimited on purpose , because I live in Long Island , and working in Brooklyn !!! So the cost of day by day to pay 11$ cost to much for me , only for the transportation , plus I need food so I don't want to spend that much money in every month so I use / Buy the Monthly card !!! But this company decided I guess to still the peoples money !!! And again , if it's happening to me ? Who promises that it's not happening to thousands of people in NY every Month ?? And every day ?? One hundred percent for sure that it's happening to a lot more people !!! And by that ? they forcing people to buy their "" new  technology  card ""  and pay more and more money , The OMNI card !!! instead of pay one time monthly purchase metro card and use it for a monthly unlimited uses the people have to pay for each ride separately !!! (2) Look in the Subway tunnels , always dirty like a pothole's !!! Full of Homeless people that bother everyone , including tourists !!! And the company making millions and Billions of money !!! where that money goes ?? Look at their representatives !!! How they treating innocent people that come to ask simple questions about how to use this and how to do that , or for directions to somewhere !!! Go by yourself , Go to places like Flushing NY !!! Or Bronx !! Or Brooklyn NY !!! insulting People , and they get out of it without any punishment !!! why ?? Because they are a Big organized  company!!! And they can bring to the courthouses more lawyers !!  And know exactly that you can not allow to yourself to pay !!! And they pay them with the money they stilling from the people !!! the individual citizens can not do anything against them !!! That's why they are the only one company in NY !!! They are the only Monopoly company in NY , and They Have the union that Belongs to them , and fallow the American History , how the Union started to build up in America !!! And the people in NY city don't have any other choice only to use their services , Because ther is no other companies around in the area to use their services with a normal price to go to places from the five boroughs to Manhattan and back !!! and you can not to talk with them even !!! Like Every other Gangster in the world , they will call the police on you !!! And will put you in jail for at least seven years !!!  But they they can talk to you whatever way they want !! To insult you !!! And kick you out of the bus or the train and you can't do nothing at all against them !!! In other words ?? They are A Big Cruel Filthy Mafia !!! Gangsters !!! Nothing else !!! That's what I feel on this MTA Company !!! I wish I had another choice to use other companies cervices in a reasonable prices to go to work and back !! But there is non of them !!!"

Yeah, a nifty subway is absolutely welcomed, but could you maybe focus your updates on your trains to be a little more punctual, you know, services people actually care about? I remember going to high school and I could actually predict when a train was going to pull in to my station, as came in around the same time every morning. Now, you'd be lucky if a train even pulled in!Tell me how you guys want to keep raising these prices on fares but then decide to do track work in the middle of a work day and shut down both sides of the tracks so people are stranded every which way. Get your shit together. And stop raising the price on rides. Like everyone has the luxury to pay for this incompetent service.And OMNY is such a ridiculous idea. Like everyone living here has the privilege of smart phones and credit cards.

22,1,"Aug 12, 2022","Current NYC mayor Eric Adams seems to have even less common sense than his pez-headed predecessor Bill de Blasio, if that's even humanly possible. The MTA's scheme to raise $1B in incremental revenue through congestion pricing for automobiles entering Manhattan is fraught with so many unintended consequences that I can only assume that they are in fact, intended and the comedians who run city government just don't care. In a scenario laid out by British newspaper The Daily Mail (London already has a similar plan) a ride into NYC from my home in Princeton will trigger $120 in congestion pricing on top of tolls, gas, parking etc. No sympathy expected, it's just an illustration.That's $200+ just to come to Manhattan in order to work, dine, play, shop etc. I don't care whether I can afford to pay or not, this punitive tax is an automatic non-starter. Under this plan it would literally be cheaper to fly into Dallas to catch a Rangers game than arrive at MSG by car. Of course that example is not perfect but you get my point. Adams is screaming for remote workers to return to their offices full time via mass transit but the Subway (not to mention the streets) remains a crime spree so who's kidding who Mr. Mayor. And as we all know the MTA is a dumping ground for cronyism and political patronage so a profound no thank you to their very porous fiscal oversight.So now you're in Manhattan and an Uber or Lyft will run you an additional $40 on top of their ridiculous dynamic pricing. Do they really want to turn Manhattan over once and for all to the gilded plutocrats for whom no cost is an impediment or imposition. Maybe they do. I have commuted to and worked in Gotham for decades (mostly on public transit) and would have no problem writing off NYC completely with my middle finger waving in the breeze.Do the Apparatchiks in NYC ever stop to consider the countless micro-decisions people make everyday about where to spend their money. If tax revenue falls 10-15 percent because tri-state suburbanites decide to venture in less often -- what happens to the majority of mainstream restaurants and theaters in Manhattan already dealing with depressed patronage. The Met Galas of the world will always be fine, it's the remaining 99.9 percent of commerce that I worry about. It's just insane.My firm belief is that NYC's government is congenitally stupid and so desperate for revenue that I have no doubt whatsoever that some version of this hair brain scheme will be implemented. Goodbye NYC you can see by my finger I think you're number 1.(BTW, if some version of this passes, there's little doubt that congestion pricing will soon be coming to a city near you.)"
23,5,"Aug 3, 2022","Today I used the MTA Mobile Van Service because my Senior Metro Card stopped working. The card is an online automatically refill because they have my credit card on file. When my trips reduce my account to $10 balance they bill my credit card $25. I can't refill it at the subway. You can call 511 for Metro Card problems and the MTA representative will tell you where the van will be located near you. I also found the full list of locations online at the website. I decided to walk to 78th on York today because the weather was not too warm. At first the line looked intimidating but within 15 minutes I was next to go inside. The employees are all definitely friendly,  professional, and people persons! I gave the one employee a laugh when he asked the problem and I said my Metro Card is broken. Once inside the really nice employee asked for the card and a photo ID. He said he would need to call to verify the balance on my card and then he would have the ability to take possession and give me a temporary Senior Card. He then also filled out a form that was multiple copies with all my information. I received one as my receipt. Then he said if I had cash I would be able to put money onto my temporary card right there or I could wait and go to the subway to put money on it. I took advantage of giving him enough money for Five Trips. The temporary card is good until September 30, 2022. He assured me my new card would come by then. If not I have to get another temporary card. He also advised me when I get the new card to use up the balance on the temporary first. When they put your cash on the card they show you the balance on it using their scanner. I'm so glad they have this service. The van is at the 92 Street Y the first Thursday each month 10-12. If tomorrow wasn't going to be so hot I would use that location. If I have problems in the future I'll know what to do now. They really made me feel like a valued customer and they have the drill down so it's as smooth as a babies butt. I'm recommending!"

I survived the construction! The employees are neat and clean in their uniforms. I spoke to two this morning. They are on the job in shifts. Five in the morning to 1pm and around the clock. They are friendly and responsive when you are in need. I know some subway stations are old and dirty. I see the homeless. What do you expect with over 8.5 million people in the city? I'm paying a lot of tax. Yes there are things that I feel my money is wasted on. I can definitely say MTA is not one of them. Come visit my city. Ride the bus and train. Enjoy the sights.

Multiple investigations (by the New York Times, Bloomberg, and the former governor) have shown that overtime fraud is rampant. MTA workers claim overtime pay and leave work early.

Of course, much more of it sucks like shit.  First the good. It has a way to get unlimited rides. There's weekly and monthly passes that you can use countless times. Bad things now. The passes are made of a tough paper, which if you're not careful enough, can get ruined. In DC they have plastic cards. Why not here? If you're extra careful like me you'll put the cards where they can't get bent. This doesn't always prevent problems. Sometimes the cards just won't work for no reason at all. That's enough about the cards. A lot more is bad. The thing getting the most complaints is the poor service. If you're paying for this system through not just your card purchases but also through your paychecks, it should give you reliable service as in trains not being delayed and other annoyances. Trains routinely have many problems.  How about fixing that air conditioning or heat. The booth workers also seem to have surliness as part of their job requirements. Many stations are really fucking gross. Walls are covered in black mold or piss stains. It still is the best transportation available. Much better than paying for outrageous cab fare. That's not saying much for the subway though."

When travelling in the Big Apple you pay one fee regardless of going one stop or several, this is compared to London's zonal system where you can travel in central London zones 1 and 2 for £7 per day (even international tourists), this means you can hop on and off all day on buses, trams or the tube, meanwhile MTA just charges you per journey.- Why is disabled access so poor? There is only one gate at most stations for prams/wheelchairs which requires a special disabled MTA ticket otherwise you could be stranded trying to get in/out which makes no sense.I also noticed the buses seemed so old too, spraying harmful smoke everywhere and the overcrowded, dirty, old subway trains weren't much better either.The transit system of NYC and the only way to get across the city and all of its' boroughs (buses, subway) is just so shockingly poor. I'm not sure how the system works in the states, but if Transport for London operated to such standards they'd be mass riots and something would be done and I think it's just unacceptable how they've been able to carry on with sub-par services while still charging high costs to get around.1*"

74,5,"Nov 11, 2019","Yes, that is right, I am writing a review for the best subway system in the United States bar none. In fact, that goes for the entire transit network, the LIRR, Metro North, the whole kit and caboodle. But this review will focus more on the subway. The New York City Subway is one of it's kind, with 469 subway stations and vast lines formerly owned by several companies before the MTA bought them all and now own and operate the subway as it's own. And they do a damn good job at maintaining it despite it's flaws. Is it perfect? No. Far from it. But for a system that is 115 years old, I would say that this is the system to mimic for all it is worth. It stops EVERYWHERE. It is CHEAP. It is THE BEST DEAL IN THE CITY. Trains are fast, frequent, and always available. It is a 24/7 system after all!And the system is always looking to modernize. Yes the system sometimes shows it's age, but at the same time it is always looking ahead towards the future. Automating lines, improving the stations, making safer walkways, there is always something to be done here. The New York City Subway is the reason I love trains. I mean once you start riding it maybe you can understand why I feel so strongly about this network of trains running above and below ground. It just feels so right to ride it everywhere. Complain all you want about the delays during rush hour and weekend maintenance, but somebody's got to be inconvenienced if you want it to continue to run at a high level. That is a small price to pay. Speaking of small prices, you just cannot find any other deal like this one in New York, and it pays off, big time."
75,5,"Apr 22, 2019","State of the motha effin' art! For REAL!

It's crazy to think that the rating is only an average of 2 stars. But then again, I don't live here. I don't know all of the ""issues"" that may be associated with this transit system. However, what I DO know is that it saved me so much money and time while visiting New York. Before I hopped on an NY subway for the first time, I could never understand why so many New Yorkers didn't know how to drive. I mean... you can ""try"" to do this in Cali, but good luck. It's hard trying to get around here on public transportation, let alone in and around the far East Bay Area and beyond. And like NY, ridesharing and taxicabs are just too expensive to be taking every day. Once I hopped amidst that mystical subway train, I knew that I would probably never rent a car or take a taxicab in NY ever again. NOW I understand why all of you New Yorkers don't know how to drive! Because you don't have to!!! The MTA goes every damn where! I am so jealous that we aren't this advanced in California. To honest, our transit system is laughable when even compared to the buses in NY! So ridiculous, but so true. It's hard to believe that this train station is over 100 years old and is still in working condition, transporting millions of people throughout New York each year! I'm sure some things can be spruced up of course, but generally speaking, this transit system is amazing. For one thing, the majority of the subway stations are located underground. Nowadays, that's not really ideal I guess. But it's just amazing how fast you can get from one end of NY to the other on the subway. Tons of people take the trains at all hours of the day and night, so if you're going solo, you won't feel alone. The stops are never too far apart from each other. NY's transit system uses a ""Metrocard"" which is good for all public transportation within the state including the NYC transits subways, local and express bus lines, Staten Island Railway, the Airtran to JFK, and a few other transit partners. The cost per ride is around $3 and you can refill your card at any Station Booth or Metrocard vending machine. They also have a 7 day and 30 day unlimited ride passes available. I purchased a 7 day unlimited ride pass for around $30 and it was really a great deal. I've spoken with a few locals in the area who have told me that the prices for the train are expensive. But to be honest, these prices are WAAAAY cheaper than our Bart train in the Bay Area! I could easily spend $10 a day getting to work and back, and that's just a short distance compared to other people who have to travel much further. I would GLADLY pay for their unlimited passes to get around NY if I lived there. Since the trains are underground, phone reception can be pretty non-existent. The train stations aren't the cleanest but I've seen a lot worse where I live. If you're carrying large luggage, good luck trying to get it through the tiny little entryway! I struggled trying to get my luggage through, and it was only a carry-on bag... okay fine, it was overstuffed... but STILL! I wish they had a least one wider entrance for large bags. Oh yeah... and all of those stories about huge NY rats at the train stations... yep, it's true. I saw the biggest rat of my entire LIFE just moseying along the waiting area at one of the stations. While I was practically dying, everyone else just went about their business and the rat ran clear across the platform. I ran to the other side. This Cali girl was NOT about to be getting attacked by a damn cat sized rat! Aside from those nuances, I truly envy NYC's transit system. I hope that one day California's transit system will advance the way that NY's has. But until then, I'm stuck with this sh*t that we call a train! NY, you need to be more appreciative of the MTA! It's a wonderful perk to have."

83,4,"Nov 24, 2018","I think my bf and I were incredibly lucky the weekend we used the MTA in NYC. After trying to use an Uber or two -- they were expensive AF, just not ideal for a quick ride (the wait was sometimes 8+ mins), and NYC tends to be  busy - the ride alone takes a long time. Remember: train stations are everywhere in NYC. Download the CityMapper app on your phone. It tells you live updates on the trains & which station to go into. Super easy. I'm directionally challenged and I was able to figure it out! We got the unlimited 7 day pass for like 30 bucks each? Around there, it wasn't outrageous. Note: we were constantly going somewhere. The unlimited pass came in handy and it saved us $$$ ride-wise (again Uber is expensive AF in NYC!). And I think 7 days is the minimum for the ""unlimited"" pass. They have more days available but we were only staying in NYC for like 4 days. As for the trains - most of them came on time (perhaps like 90%). The other 10% of the time, the trains were delayed maybe 5 mins. I heard other NYC-ers tell me that trains are sometimes very delayed.

88,3,"Oct 3, 2015","Oh... the MTA subway system..In my 20+ years in this city.. A couple of positives. LONG list of negatives. Some interesting experiences. Some interesting people.First of all, I agree with reviewer Tina C., in that ""New York City has the MOST efficiently covered citywide system. It is truly the ONLY one system in the whole world that operates 24/7 @ 365 days a year."" Now I can't speak for other major cities, but I can speak for my home city of Shanghai. Ok, last time I was back in Shanghai was 2011..and even then, the subways in Shanghai..however technologically advanced they were compared to NYC, however clean and well maintained they were compared to the dump that is MTA's subways.. The subways in Shanghai DO NOT run 24/7. So just on that point alone..NYC's subways has the win! But damn..back to the maintenance issue. Many of NYC's subway stations are so filthy! The stations themselves are dirty.. the tracks have so much garbage..frequently starting track fires that cause delays in the commute. Lots of homeless people congregate in the subways too. From my experiences in taking the E and F trains, I've seen homeless people hog an entire corner in the a subway car, sleeping on the seats and having bags of their belongings strewn about in front of them. Navigating the subway system is more efficient and easier in recent years. Most major stations have wireless connectivity. And there are many mobile apps you can download like Embark NYC and Exit Strategy, that can give you up-to-date information on Subway times, delays, etc.Taking the NYC subway system as a primary transportation every day..you can see people from all walks of life..and many people may say, that is the ""beauty"" of NYC; it's such a huge melting pot of different cultures. And that's true.. You can see some interesting people in the subways..loll Although, I know many people who say it is because of so many ""weirdos"" in the subways, that they refuse to take the subways and prefer to drive to the city or take the LIRR. So it is honestly a love/hate relationship..loll"

Their website looks like it's from 1995 and is impossible to understand. They also do not refund your balance back to your credit card for 10-12 business days even though your card is immediately canceled.

Metrocard doesn't work if you just used it like if you entered the wrong side and had to exit and re-enter on the other side. They need to remove the 18 minute time restriction. Also sometimes the Metrocard reader does not work because the machine can't read your card.3. Equipment breakdowns... (Trains, track signals etc.) if the train breaks down in service, it creates a massive bottle-neck and you can be stuck for a long time. This is a serious problem that needs urgent attention.

That said, for the weekend a friend and I spent in Manhattan, staying near the Theater District and wanting to see the usual tourist sites like the Statue of Liberty, 9/11 Memorial, Chinatown, Columbus Circle, etc. the subway system was perfect for us. It was fairly easy to navigate, it was reliable on that particular weekend, and the cost was reasonable as well.

110,1,"Aug 2, 2019","I once had an opportunity to make a pitch for discounted test preparation to the MTA's workers union in downtown Brooklyn. This was, at the time, the most important sales meeting of my life. I made it to their Court Street palace early, went up the fourteen floors on a neon lit elevator, and was escorted into a state of the art boardroom with a long table. Seated at the table were twelve apostolic fat white men, the likes of which you'd find pointing and barking orders at the honest MTA workers shoveling bat shit off the third rail. The ogres then offered me some water and asked me where my partner (our lead salesperson) was. I then apologized and told them she hit some traffic and was running a bit late. The MTA Union president, the fattest of the 12 sweating beasts, laughed and asked me how I got to the office. I told him I took the R train.  He then leaned back in his plush chair, placed his ruddy hands behind his thick skull and said, ""Now look who arrived on time.""I arrived ""on time"", by the way, because I left forty minutes early. My partner likely hit traffic because most people would rather drive in the worst of Manhattan traffic than roll the dice on a smelly NYC subway car that was likely to stall out at any given moment. No matter the reason, the fact remains: the MTA is an organized crime organization the likes of which New York has never seen in its sordid history. It is, to most resident New Yorkers a necessary evil. Like genital warts after a night at a whore house.Only replace the whore house with just a general place where you're forced to go to work, buy groceries, meet a first date, go on a job interview, and rush to see a dying loved one in the ICU before they go quietly into the night. Odds are, if you live in an outer borough in NYC, you will be late to all of these occasions thanks to the fat douchebags getting discounted SAT classes for their spoiled pre-diabetic children. The MTA is now posting ads about cracking down on fare evaders with signs that read, ""We'd prefer you pay the $2.75 than the $100 fine."" Only trouble with this brilliant piece of cautionary marketing? The fare is already $3.00 a ride. The bastards couldn't even keep the price down long enough to make their own expensive banner campaign relevant.You see, this is only a small share of the enraging hypocrisy and economic rape the MTA continues to inflict on every day New Yorkers. Here's another one if you think I'm being too harsh on a system that employs so many perfectly kind and hard working city folk. About a year into living in NYC, I began to notice an uptick in trash on the subway. Even the MTA started to take notice and built in pre-recorded messages on the train about track fires resulting from litter and garbage on the platforms. The real reason for this litter issue? The MTA single handedly removed 1/3 of all trash cans in the subway stations as a means for ""reducing"" pollution. With no place to put one's trash, what did New Yorkers do? Why, of course, they polluted. These days, the MTA remains that bullshit bar on Time's Square that serves free spicy peanuts and cuts you off when you drink too much. They are quite literally the source of all of their own problems, and worse yet, all and I mean ALL the problems in the city. Don't believe me? Let's look at the life cycle of the NYC subway system: The MTA's purposely faulty, corrupt, Union-based construction causes delays on all train lines. The delays then cause train malfunctions and brake degradation. The resulting train malfunctions and delays cause motion sick passengers to pull emergency brakes instead of getting off at the next stop. These sick passengers cause further delays thereby increasing mass depression and layoffs across the city. These layoffs result in an income disparity between those who must ride the subway, and those who don't have to. What happens next? A mass exodus of middle class New Yorkers and a rise in homelessness, of course. The remaining homeless who are too poor to leave the city then flood the train platforms in search of air conditioning and spare change. The people on the train, now poor and depressed themselves, give nothing to the homeless. Seeing the lack of options, one of these poor homeless men throws himself in front of an oncoming R Train and further causes more delays. Rinse. Repeat. $2.75 to $3.00. After all, someone has to clean up the mess.If any business was as poorly run, grossly misrepresented, and abhorrently self-sabotaging as the MTA, they'd be a Dateline expose every week. But no, we've just learned to accept the molestation with no plans for change. Like global warming and the existence of Ed Sheeran, we just roll with it. Well I won't. I say we skip the turnstile all at once one day, and scream to the heavens, ""I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it any more!"" I say we all pull the emergency brake whenever we feel like it. Just let me get to my 2AM taco uptown first."

Yet, it's still the easiest and quickest way to get around the whole city. Cheaper than a cab ride too. Unless they are doing trackwork for the zillionth time! Or there are signal problems! Or some a-hole who is sick gets on the train and delays it!"
126,1,"Dec 14, 2017","MTA represents what's wrong in NYC to me. I've lived in NYC all my life and relied on MTA all my life. In my earlier years, MTA was not the mess it is now. Trains weren't breaking down as frequently and the stench in MTA has not changed; still smells like piss everywhere I go. Same, if not, a declining service but they have no qualms about increasing fares. Once one fare increase passes, they're already vying for the next fare increase. It's not about managing a debt, it's about a quick fix to the detriment of riders. deja vu. Can't do nothing but move out of NYC."
127,1,"Aug 28, 2014","So I can write a review for the MTA, that's great because I am so displeased with their service. I have lived in NYC all my life and know the supposed ""progression"" in service that has occurred all these years and lemme tell y'all, it's limited. Almost at the end of every budget year they scramble for more money and their scrambling is coming up to the citizens of NYC and telling them to cough it up by paying extra for fares. That's crazy. This is in addition to the tax dollars we pay. Where is MTA's money going? In my opinion, I think it goes to pay for unchecked overtime that workers do but who supervises these overtimes, then there's pension and then there is MTA's debt. Why should the citizens of NYC pay for their mistake in mismanaging their money and suffer bad service? I don't need more signs to tell me where my train is or wifi in the train stations, those are added bonuses. Your main objective is provide me and everyone else service to get from point A to point B which means your concentration should be on creating better train service not a better train experience. That's secondary. Get your priorities straight MTA!"

I was few steps behind the last person ,  the driver could clearly see me coming, yet he closed the door one second before I walk up.  Perfect timing.

129,4,"Apr 22, 2012","This is the 33rd street local station on the 6 IRT subway line; it's one of the original 28 stations in the system. http://forgotten-ny.com/2006/01/the-original-28-part-1-a-look-at-the-artwork-from-the-nycs-first-28-stations-opened-october-27-1904-2/ There is no transfer and no express; there is an alternate entrance/exit at 32nd street in addition to the one at 33rd. It's been remarkably well-kept, with the original glass tiles and natural woodwork. The neatest thing in the station is the public, functional art: graceful cast-bronze rails that wrap around pillars in the station and make surprisingly comfortable seats. (Plus, your butt helps keep them polished.) The piece is called ""Lariat Seat Loops"" and was done in 1997 by James Garvey. (I noticed today they've also got some of these seats in the Wall Street station of the 4 and 5 trains as well.)"
130,4,"Feb 27, 2012","Oh, how I love this station...oh, I love how the name comes trippingly to the tongue. Only in Brooklyn do you have melodious names like ""Hoyt-Schermerhorn."" [sarcasm]This subway station is truly a ""piece a woik,"" as they say. If you read my other reviews, you know I really do love the gum-stained concrete platforms and white tile walls with yellow railings on the staircases. I have no idea when the station is scheduled to be renovated, although the Jay street station one stop up on the A/C line has just been completed.This is a sprawling station that includes both the A and G (Brooklyn-Queens crosstown) lines; there are plenty of inactive platforms, and still it's a pretty efficient station. The G parallels the A here giving you an easy transfer. (The G itself is a whole 'nother story; that train is a sorry piece a woik.)From SubwayNut's guide to stations: http://subwaynut.com/ind/hoyt_schermerhorna/index.php""Hoyt-Schermerhorn Streets is a very unusual IND express station and across platform transfer point between Fulton Street Line A,C trains and Crosstown Line G trains. The station has four island platforms and six tracks in total, with only the central four tracks and two island platforms are currently in use. The outer two island platforms (The A,C trains platform at both tracks) and wall tracks are permanently closed and only saw about ten years of service for the Court Street shuttle, to that IND station that is now the transit museum. The tracks do see service at times for movie shoots and the station name tiling beneath the wall trim has been known to be for other stations from time to time courtesy of this. The station's former large full mezzanine have been cut apart in a completely ridiculous manor, now with a NYPD transit police station and other non-public areas. There are two staircases up from each platform to a small mezzanine towards the middle of the platform to where the station's only fare control area is, after fare control narrow passageways lead in either direction along one side of the former full length mezzanine to a single staircase at each end up to street level to exits along the north side of Schmerhorn Street near either Hoyt Street or Bond Street. Unusually, each of these exits is set at street level within buildings."""
131,2,"Nov 1, 2015",For someone who doesn't use the subway system a lot I have to say it is rather confusing at first until the second or third time finding your way.  A city below a city.  Quick pace for the knowledgeable users.  Once I started using an app on my cell phone all fell into place and I got it. Pretty amazing a 7 minute ride can save you 40 minutes of walking time.  Cheaper than a taxi and you don't have to sit in traffic.  Lots of characters down below and normal travelers.  Always something to see and it doesn't have to be Halloween to see it.  Just remember to wash your hands after traveling!
132,1,"Jul 14, 2015","INEFFICIENT SERVICE. I have traveled to Paris, London, Moscow and all have highly superior subway systems. The MTA has frequent delays. The tracks are covered in trash at a lot of stations, I think the people working for the MTA are purposely delaying trains. Something is very wrong with this system. Why do they not power wash the beautiful remaining Mosaics? They don't wash them so that they can create jobs tearing them down and putting up new ones with ugly bathroom style tiles and take several months to finish the job (as usual).THE MTA is beyond bad. Here is a blatant example of typical behavior from the system administrators (excuse the confusing language but this exemplifies it)""LADIES & GENTLEMAN THE TRAIN ACROSS THE PLATFORM WILL BE MOVING FIRST"" (the herds scurry across the platform, fear stricken, some panicking, some angry and agitated, many tired) MTA: ""LADIES AND GENTLEMAN THIS TRAIN IS NOW OUT OF SERVICE YOU MUST NOW MOVE ACROSS THE PLATFORM TO THE NEXT TRAIN"" (The doors remain shut, it's cold windy and rainy outside, people are visibly upset, meanwhile subway doors are shut and won't let anyone in the cars) People sit. ""DO NOT BLOCK THE DOORS (Roars the loudspeaker) YOU ARE DELAYING THE TRAINS (Notice how they avert to blaming the MTA customers for the delay and scolding them like little children) The train sits there for 15 minutes and finally moves. This could be an excellent system if it had an overhaul and changed it completely. For now it will continue to be a piece of sh*t. I don't think this is what the builders of the system intended."
133,3,"Feb 25, 2014","Ah, the 33rd street station.  It's tiny and you'll be waiting for some time on the 6 to arrive (and it's a local station that you have to leave & pay again for if you end up on the wrong side) but at least it does have those convenient times clocks & you can get cell reception down here if you stay near the entrance.It kind of goes without saying that the MTA sucks."
134,3,"Jul 14, 2013","The station within a station.  You can look across the way & see the other platforms for the train in the same direction; are they the old ones or new ones that will be in use long after we're dead & gone?  I hate the lack of a second entrance to get to this one; when we were coming back, there was a huge mass of people in front of the stairs to get down here.But they do have a covered entrance to get in and there is more to this station than some of the other ones.  Not as nice as it could be but you can do a lot worse."
137,3,"Oct 31, 2013","Love/Hate.  The subways actually aren't that bad.  Yes; certain lines are FAR better than others.  But they run relatively close to being on schedule.  And the new measures to make stations with electronic wait times and announcements along with the new internet hot spots (even if bandwidth is still an issue) help make me feel the rate hikes are actually doing something more than paying for some rather high blue collar (no offense meant by that term) salaries.  The buses, though.....meh.  I know they can only stick to their schedule due to traffic but so much....but I've had to wait, and had friends have to wait, for buses which never come....or decide they're not doing the last run of the night...and the only way to find this out is to call some magic number, which isn't easily found through public means, to see if the driver called off.  That's some shady stuff, especially on Express lines.That being said, the Select buses are awesome."
138,3,"Jul 17, 2012",Ok.  The name is awesome and sometimes makes me smile.  So I'll bump my review up to a 3-star one.  But I really hate having to transfer at this station.  I'd much rather use Jay Street.  This one just seems so vacant and industrial.  Not a fan...but not a hater.

141,1,"Jan 23, 2017","Pretty simple review here MTA is trash... yet they continue to raises fares. Trains/buses are rarely on time, stations smell like the ninja turtles hideout and are just as clean, the possibility of contracting an STD jut touching a rail is always a possibility and the chance of spotting some acrobatic wild life while on the platform or in the train is an absolute certainty. The MTA is a joke of an organization who's execs makeMillions and continue to raise prices and continue to lower quality. Don't even get me started on MTA booth workers. They hate their lives and people who actually make them do their job. God forbid you ask them for directions or to combine the money on your metro card. They should just replace them all with a machine at least the machine has manners an etiquette although that's programmed into it. The rats in the station have more social skills then the employees. God forbid you get a cart that has air conditioning in the middle of July or a set that has heat in the middle of January. The cleanest thing in a subway station is the garbage can and the homeless guy peeing on himself in the corner."

143,1,"Apr 6, 2017","Total scam and fraud! Criminals in uniforms.They treat customers like cargo. They established totally illegal courts to ""sue"" their livestock cargo (humans) who had their UNLIMITED metrocard in their pockets but entered without using it because otherwise they would miss their lousy trains (trying to squeeze against exiting traffic). I'm talking about a train, which was already 30 minutes late. They managed to employ CITY POLICE which are paid by TAXPAYER'S MONEY to enforce their PRIVATE CORPORATE fake ""laws"".They intentionally cause up to 2 hours train delays just to enjoy seeing their cargo suffering, losing money off work and canceling 2 months long waited doctor appointments. They do it just because they can. They are proud of ruining people's lives. They lobbied most politicians in NY to do what they say.Their conductors play ""I gotcha!"" game, pinching their cargo with closing doors and ohh..... they enjoy doing that, especially if it's a 99 years old grammy!!! I bet they compete amongst each other on who got the highest number of livestock pinched that way at the end of their shifts. And, like classic tyrants, they had the audacity to enact another illegal ""law"" toprosecute any head of livestock cargo (customers) who dares to open his mouth for complaining to such a noble ""His Majesty Conductor"" for being pinched with closing doors repeatedly for several times, after they waited their standard 1 hour for the damn train. And to intimidate they cargo even more, they even put those stickers that say ""7 YEARS IN PRISON!"" for complaining against anything. You can observe these stickers in every subway car.They intentionally created a system where there's no responsible person for anything. This is done so that they can get away with any crime and violation of human rights they can possibly come up with.Their employees are severely overpaid. Anyone can observe up to 20 of them sitting on the tracks or stations, drinking soda, laughing and having good time for 4-6 hours straight, during the time they were supposed to fix the tracks. They especially like doing that on weekends and nights so that their leisure time would be paid x 1.5 for weekends plus another x 1.5 for nights.Did I mention the brown sludge that pours on heads of their cargo in the 150 years-old catacombs they call ""subway stations""? They had 150 years to fix that but won't do it because then how will they enjoy seeing their cargo obliterated?MTA is the single most criminal, most anti-human, anti-american and most suppressive organization in NYC."

My visit was rather painless, although I frown upon the need to deal with a situation like this using pen and paper.  The clerk who assisted me with this issue quoted a turnaround time of several weeks, though I noticed the refund in my account about 10 days after my visitIn my case, I got refunded for slightly more than 80% of the damaged monthly metro card that I took in: $93.50 / $112.Note that the refund amount is calculated using the length between A.) the day your metro is either taken in or mailed and B.) the expiration date of the damaged metro card."

Negatives: dirtier, too many annoying performers, maze-like labyrinths (that are actually sometimes fun when tipsy, you just walk and walk and there are hidden little artistic touches at most stops), often too hard to figure out which is express and which is not (the sound speakers are horribly garbled, a real shame), and too hard to figure out limitations for weekends and after hours for casual users.

153,1,"Mar 12, 2019","Honestly, taking the subway was the WORST part of our trip. We decided to rent an Airbnb close to Harlem (to save on an expensive Manhattan hotel), so we relied on the subway to go to any tourist attraction.  Considering this is a world class city, the subway is an extreme disappointment.Heads up:- Expect delays (during the day, but especially at night). - The M.T.A. can cancel a part of the line unexpectedly, for the whole weekend. Their app won't help as they are slow to update. Download a PDF of the subway map to find an alternative route. - They can also end the train schedule earlier at their own discretion...""from 9 pm to 11 pm."" It was quite unpredictable what time exactly the last train would run. Again, the app/website was not updating as quick as their changes. Always plan an alternate route!! - Some ticket  booth operators are lazy, they will not help you to purchase the exact amount of trips, even if you know how much you want to put in. Plan and do your research! If you know you need 20 trips, pay for exactly 20 trips on your metrocard. If they say only to put $10, and you know you'll be staying for more than 2 days, you're saving them time on your dime. For exactly 20 trips on the pay-per-ride metrocard, I knew to put $52.40 so I would get a 0 balance (technically $0.02) at the end of my trip. I guess they hate counting change, because they insisted on only putting in $20 and just keep adding ""whatever."" - The speakers are crap. Download a .pdf map on your phone, so you feel you know where you're going. - There is Internet! BUT it only works in stations. So when you're actually travelling on the train, you lose connection. What is the point of that? - The subway is really dirty. You do see rats on the tracks. Certain areas can smell like a combination of hot garbage and urine. - There are a lot of panhandlers and drug addicts on the subway.Pros: - It's the cheapest mode of transportation in New York"

They raise the damn fare it seems like every 2 years yet where are the improvements? WHERE???? Then, like many others have stated, many of them have the worst attitudes. Only thing I can say is the damn signs telling you how long til your train comes(which I do appreciate) and the damn 34th street Hudson yards station that was added. Btw, that station is the cleanest/nicest station I've ever been in, too fuckin bad not that many ppl commute to that stop. Yeah, yeah I know it's ""up and coming"" area...blah fuckin blah.

Maybe you're more into exacting physical pain? Not to worry! You can operate the train doors and allow them to close on people, or, if you're especially ambitious, orchestrate a full derailment! Ensuring that our trains are consistently late and overcrowded makes for hilarious scenes of people just trying to squeeze in before the train pulls away.

158,5,"Jul 20, 2013","The MTA is the best public transportation system in America. If it sounds like I'm bragging, consider:* You can ride for miles on just $2.50 - less if you buy a monthly pass - and monthly and pay-as-you-go cardholders alike enjoy unlimited free transfers. Even a beater car or truck will cost you more in the long run. * No matter where you live in the 5 boroughs, your destination is less than an hour away, so long as you know how to take the bus and can understand the coverage maps. Before you throw your hands up and declare the system too confusing to bother with, take an afternoon to memorize the maps. It really helps. * The stations are safe, and most are quiet and acceptably clean. Many folks have vivid memories of MTA trains and stations in the Beame/Koch years and the customer experience has improved by leaps and bounds since then. * Manhattan coverage is arranged on a logical grid system, and identifying which lines take you where is a breeze if you think about them as ""the Lex"" instead of ""4/5/6"" or ""6th Ave. line"" instead of ""B/D/F/M.""* Even if you live beyond a train line, such as in far Eastern Queens or Southern Brooklyn, you will find multiple buses that take you where you need to go. * Most lines run 24/7/365, unlike any other public transit system in the USA.Are our trains and buses sometimes late, occasionally missing (during strikes or inclement weather), and infrequently smelly? Sure. And it also sucks to pay $2.50 per trip if you're used to getting anywhere in NYC for a dollar. But keep in mind that you live in America, a nation of millions who worship the personal automobile and refuse to fund city infrastructure ('cause it's a ""handout"") while demanding that city taxpayers grant them free highway upgrades and low-cost parkway tolls (""they owe me"") across thousands of cul-de-sacs, gated communities, and exurbs in all 50 states. You'll be hard-pressed to find a better transit system without a passport and a pricy plane ticket to capital cities like London and Tokyo. So the only folks who can legitimately complain are those who grew up outside the U.S. Take a deep breath, check the map, swipe your card, and enjoy the ride. The MTA will get you there in the big maze known as NYC."

Einstein working in the MTA booth always refuses to issue me a credit or refund saying it's my fault.

I ride 2-3 times a day. I often have to leave 2 hours ahead of time because who knows how many delays may occur. You could literally travel 100 miles or more or go through 2 states in the time it takes to go to Queens to Manhattan. Human piss and feces in the train cars are the norm, I shouldn't have to gag and hold back throw up (which if I did throw up and couldn't clean up myself would probably stay there until it crusted over.) on my commute. Many of the cars don't have ACs in the summer, my experience on the 123 train last year (2016) was 2 out of 3 times the cars did not have air which is difficult if you have asthma. Often times I opted to take an Uber, being able to breathe is a priority but obviously the MTA doesn't take that seriously. I've seen people being carried out on stretchers from heat exhaustion (example 14th St F stop and Jay Metro R train 2016). Trains change over to another line or skip stops without any announcements. The irony of it all is that as I write this the F train conductor all of a sudden announces the Queens bound train is now going back to Brooklyn and that we all need to get off. The only thing worse than having to deal with the MTA on a regular basis is having Trump as President."

Thank goodness for that. They did try their best."
165,1,"Apr 20, 2015","Go to any other city in the world--London, Prague, Paris, Berlin, Moscow--and the difference in the service of their metros compared to the MTA makes me embarrassed to say I live in New York City.  Consistently unreliable service and delay after delay, lousy attitudes by employees, garbage trains, horrible communication, lack of upgrades, lack of cleanliness, horribly tourist unfriendly....it's a third world subway system. I've been living in NY my entire life, and just when I think it can't get worse...another delay."

Super upset as of course they were my favorite gloves , last Friday I decided and ask if the folks that clean the tracks may have turned in my glove. The lovely thoughtful women worksi the toll booth (whom I have since found out only works at 14th Street & 1st Avenue on Fridays) was so so so  kind. She offered to call the appropriate staff and they would be at teh station in about an hour. Not realizing such a service was available, I was on my way to an appointment and couldn't  She advises that she could not  hold the glove for me very long, but if I wanted to back on Monday.. she would make the call.I returned home early on Sunday and walked to the station.

168,4,"Dec 7, 2012","The subway is by far the best- quickest and cheapest- way to get from borough to borough and back, as well as a quick jaunt up just about ANY avenue.  The only two problems with the MTA are cleanliness and temperature control (in stations) and for this I can't really blame them because most of their system is running underground 24 hours a day, all that traffic leaving little time for servicing and cleaning. I am disgruntled and upset by MTA's lack of a consistent refund policy. Metrocards expire in a year window. During the two years after that, you have to trade in your card, but that process is way more difficult than it needs to be.  Perhaps it wouldn't be so difficult if I had been told that certain new machines can issue refunds for up to 12 months, and I am just beyond that point now. Terrible training and conflicting information regarding when and how to get a refund. That's the peril you will face if you buy 4.5 rides on one card just to get the 70 cent bonus. Perhaps I should have paid full fare a la carte with paper tickets instead of involving myself in the money waste that is a stored value card. The savings sounds good until you do the percentages and find out how much excess money gets left on the card after usage and reloading."

170,4,"Sep 13, 2013","We always use the subway when we're in town. If you take a few minutes to familiarize yourself with the layout, it get you where you want to go.  For the benefit of out of towners, I would make a few suggestions to the system:1. MORE MAPS EVERYWHERE. Before and after the turnstiles, on the platforms, everywhere. The London Underground is plastered with maps and it really helps.2. LIST THE STATIONS AT THE PLATFORMS. London Underground has a list of stations that each line stops at, on the wall facing commuters as they board the train. It's hard to get on the wrong train if you see your stop on the station list.3. Keep upgrading the stations. I know urban grunge chic, but c'mon...That said, NYC subway is THE model for public transit in the USA, it really works and it should be copied everywhere."
171,1,"Jul 15, 2015","Literally the worst public transportation system in the country. I would give it zero stars if I could.

This is absolutely, without a doubt, as good as it will ever get for the MTA and I don't mean that as a veiled dis either. The subway system is old and massive; 468 stations spread out over 4 of the 5 boroughs (not including the SIRR of course). The sheer amount of volume it handles is staggering, so of course it can be filthy, require constant construction, have weekend service cuts bordering on severe for some lines, etc. I pose this one question for the standard MTA hater; Can you imagine NY functioning without it?Sandy was a colossal bummer for sure, and the slow recovery messed me up big time. Yes it is pricier than it was, and the price is going up. I still consider it the main lifeblood holding NYC together. For all the times I've waited 25 minutes for a train to take my drunk ass home only to see the station cleaning posse arrive there have been other times where I've made it from Manhattan to the outer boroughs in much less time than a car would take. Love it, hate it, whatever; if you're not satisfied with it you might as well be yelling at the sky!"

I HATE THE MTA because there are RARELY accurate scheduling times posted on the poorly maintained website, trains seem to go on whatever schedule they choose being that I have to find alternatives because trains repeatedly skip stops due to being late in the first place.

If you have a problem -NO ONE will help you (see below) -just get the single ride ($2.50).  The bad - We had problem with our Metro cards (1damaged and 1 damaged and double charged).   Nobody was willing to help us our problem. The operator told us we had to buy brand new Metro cards and handed us a form to fill out and mail in to get a refund.    The forms were a pain in the a** to fill out because it required detail information that nobody would even remember or know about( but lucky for us we kept all our receipts).  I'm still waiting to see if we will actually get a refund.   After our terrible experience with the metro cards, we decided whenever we need to take the subway we brought  the single ride tickets ($2.50 per ride)  instead of the Metro card even though it would have save us a little money ($2.25 per ride)."

182,1,"Jun 12, 2017","I had a similar experience as a previous poster regarding EasyPay.  I had purchased an EasyPay Metrocard thinking it would simplify and quicken my daily commute. Firstly, I applied for the card online, and did not receive the card for over 3 weeks. Then, after sometime, the card stopped working and told me to report to an agent (who simply told me to call EasyPay).  It took another 4 weeks to receive a new card.  Recently, I noticed that I had lost my card and reported it as soon as I realized.  Then I began getting all these large charges on my credit card from EasyPay (even though I had set up a specific replenish amount that was nowhere near the amount of these charges).  When I called EasyPay, they told me that I was still responsible for this over $200 charge because it was incurred before I reported the card lost.  If you go into my activity, you will see the general pattern of where and when I use the card, and the sudden influx of uses once it was lost (over 30 uses in one single day at the same location that is NOWHERE near where I use my card). Even though the woman I spoke to agreed that there was an obvious misuse of my card, she said that I am still responsible for the cost. They need to fix this problem so that it doesn't happen again or to anyone else.  I have family and friends in other cities around the world who have a similar metrocard system, but have never had to deal with such an archaic way of dealing with situations like these."

192,2,"Jul 4, 2012","The temperature in the actual stations and on the platforms when it's over 90°F outside, feels like it's only somewhat cooler, with all the heat trapped inside, so take note that it will be quite hot inside, while you're walking through the stations and waiting on the platforms.  Inside the trains, it wasn't that bad - at least the ones I went on were all air-conditioned.  The speed and frequency, when it comes to how fast and often the trains arrive and depart, were pretty fast and frequent for the most part.  I used the Metro about 5-6 times during my few days in Manhattan and although I was glad to have been able to get to my destination and back in a relatively quick amount of time -- overall, I wasn't too impressed with it.  Really sucks if you have a problem with your MetroCard though, especially if you happen to encounter a problem with it at an entrance/exit point where there appears to be absolutely no station agent staffing available at all.  If you already paid and the turnstile doesn't work, for example, you're pretty much screwed so you'll have no choice (unless you want to pay your fare twice) but hopefully have someone open the emergency exit door to let you in/out, which of course sets off a loud alarm.  And adding more $ on that existing MetroCard that's not working though, unfortunately does not solve anything nor does it make it work, as we learned, so please do not do that.  You will need to just buy a single-ride ticket and try again.  We thought that inserting the current MetroCard we had into the machines to add more fare would spew out a new one (as some transportation systems do), but this is not the case. The turnstile system here is at times particularly tricky in my opinion and I especially would advise against using the high entrance-exit turnstile, called ""HEET"" (the cage-like revolving doors), unless you absolutely have to.  I understand how the whole concept works and the reason for having these types of turnstiles is to curb fare-beaters from jumping the low-bar turnstiles, but the designs of the HEETs are just simply not user friendly.  Yes, it's to most people, simple and straight-forward since all you do is swipe your MetroCard, step straight ahead and push the bars forward, but of course, things can and do go wrong.  I personally didn't have any problems with it, but I had witnessed a number of people having trouble with it.  If you incorrectly push the wrong set of bars, the turnstiles won't work.  Or if you step into the wrong opening of the HEET (slightly left of center) the turnstile will rotate in the correct counter-clockwise direction, for a few feet, then it locks again.  Re-swiping your MetroCard because you thought it didn't read correctly without looking at the display, will charge you twice for one ride.  I learned afterwards that even regular/long-time riders will tell you to avoid the HEETs if possible and rather use the waist-heigh turnstiles if available.  In general, I would give one star for the Metro for being available to take you around from point A to point B and one star for the frequency and speed.  Though much more complicated (in terms of the sheer amount of the different lines/platforms), the JR subway system in Japan on the other hand, was to me, much more better overall."

Any chance they'll FedEx the replacement? No. So now I have to buy another card in the interim, for which I will have to chase the MTA for a refund of any unused balance.

Being stalled on the 405 motivated Jamie W. and me to try the LA Metro for the very first time. We heard mixed things about the subway, but what the hell.Mixed was how we felt after our inaugural round trip. We each bought a one-day pass for $3.50, half off the regular $7, by adding Tap cards to our Apple Wallets. We got on the Red Line at the cavernous Civic Center/Grand Park station and took it nine stops to the evocative Hollywood/Vine station which features Art Deco palm trees and miles of empty film reels on the station ceiling. That part of the experience was kinda cool, but the train itself was well worn...There was a surly vibe to the onboarding passengers. After nine stops, I could see why. Random yelling. Bros chugging beers. Seniors left standing. Few masks. But there was no getting around the convenience or the bargain price point. Maybe because LA is all about the car culture, the subway didn't feel as indispensable as the NYC Metro. We had a better experience later that day using our pass for the 4 bus to WeHo on Santa Monica Blvd. Perhaps LA won't be too much for the man.RELATED - Exploring LA?

33,1,"Jun 24, 2023","Until recently I would have given the LA Metro System a much higher rating. My beef with them is their new Stored Value payment system for the buses & subway. I am a senior and for years I have been getting a monthly pass for unlimited use for $20 a month! The new Fare Capping system with stored value on your tap card is going to cost Seniors & the disabled who only ride the bus a few times a week MUCH MORE than the old $20 Monthly passes! Why would LA Metro want to add even more hardship to it's senior & disabled riders? IT REALLY SUCKS! Now, instead of the ease of adding my $20 for a pass at the beginning of the month I am going to have to keep an eye on my Stored value & if I run out of money ( which I do EVERY month trying to live on SS Retirement ) I will have no money left to ride the bus & be stranded. I would like to thank the IDIOTS at LA Metro for this added hardship to both the Senior & Disabled communities of the LA area. Inflation is already crushing us & now you just have to go and ruin it for us all even more. Why screw-up something that was working fine for us? Because, you obviously do not care even one minute iota about us seniors or disabled!"

The urine smell in the elevator in the Wilshire and Western is worse than any third-world country public toilet, I do not understand where the taxpayer money goes."

I've been riding it on/off since I've moved here in 2012 and I can't tell you how many times I've been let down by the unreliable system. From public safety issues to trains/buses being late or completely never showing up, it's awful. It's affordable, which I'll give credit for, but it's inconsistently truly drags down the system overall. I couldn't imagine commuting via public transit to work every day in LA. Depending on where you're at, you'd need to plan 2-3 hours MINIMUM to even make it to your destination on time.

After returning to riding the train in recent months, I was shocked at the decline in security and cleanliness. Transients take over a lot of space on the trains and inhabit the stations. I was ""treated"" to a screaming fit by an unstable woman who was halfway across the car for being ""too close."" I've been stalked and harassed; people regularly smoke marijuana and other things on platforms and in the trains with no consequences. The final straw was getting a parking ticket that Metro refuses to dismiss on a technicality even though I paid the fee. Continuing to fight it would cost me more money. I'd rather put my money into paying for gas instead of continuing to compromise my safety, sanity and dignity by riding Metro."

Then late to work because the following bus driver drove ridiculously slow. Sundays, sometimes the bus doesn't come at all. I've called customer support and I was told ""the bus is on time but it's a little behind schedule."" Your service is atrocious and some of your drivers have no people skills.

The train was probably about 5 seconds away from hitting him.  All of us waiting in the station started to gasp and were trying to figure out what to do.  I felt my heart sink and honestly thought for sure that this young man was going to die in a very gruesome way in front of a lot of people.  But thank God the operator was super fast in pulling the emergency stop and halted the train probably within a couple seconds of hitting the guy.

59,2,"Dec 3, 2018","I wanted to leave a public comment on what is perhaps a glaring oversight of Metro Los Angeles. If you look at the public transit rail system for Southern California, there is a place in Santa Fe Springs/Norwalk where they should have combined the LA Metrorail Green line station at Hoxie Avenue, Norwalk with the Amtrak station on Imperial Hwy to allow people from San Diego County and Orange County to access LAX and the LA Metrorail with better ease. If you look at a map (picture uploaded to this review), the stations are 10 minutes away from each other. Given this glaring oversight, at the very least, there needs to be another Green Line station at this Amtrak station to combine the public railway systems. It's a no-brainer that would have been done decades ago in any European country."

Is it that same mentality that is indicative of ""you have a beating heart"" followed by a trophy for breathing and ""here are your accolades for involuntary respiration!!! Keep up the good work!"" There is literally no excuse for the subpar public transportation in Los Angeles, the second largest city in the United States. If Los Angeles can create movies that make Scarlett Johansson look like she can act, then we should be able to expect more from our public transportation than what we have currently. Honestly, even gophers are better at this than we are. So are earthworms. And they don't even have eyeballs. Getting from Point A to Point B need not involve ten switchovers with imbecilic waiting times. Also important: the 5:1 ratio between the severely unhinged commuters and the rest of us, i.e. the marginally mentally ill commuters that keep hoping today will be different when we look at the Metro's time schedule and expect it to be only *slightly* incorrect. If more expansive cities that are ten times the size of LA can figure out how to efficiently and semi-safely whoosh millions of people around the various regions of a metropolitan area, so should and can LA."

If you are able to take the Rapid which are red use it. They have much fewer stops. Make sure your stop is one they use.The Red and Purple lines can be pretty ghetto. It smells of homelessness. Several homeless spend the entire day on the trains sleeping until they get kicked off. They will just board another car. You might have a musician on your car playing for donations. If you hear bells jingling then Incense man is aboard selling his stinky incense. Well at least it smells better than the homeless. I've only been on the Green line a couple times but its ghetto. Not as bad as Red and Purple but still ghetto. Blue and Expo aren't to bad. They have more vendors than any line I've been on. One was even selling beer. Expo is nicer of the two with newer cars.Gold is the nicest of them all. The cars are new and clean. I haven't seen bums or vendors yet.

I could have been seriously injured or killed! I was not in this driver's blind spot as my hood was partially in line/view of the front exit's glass doors.I always avoid driving near trucks, buses, or other large vehicles because I generally feel they are aggressive/careless drivers. I generally give them leeway when they need to merge into my lane, but this STUPID driver did not signal until after s/he was partially into my lane.Go back to driver's ed & get some training, or get some sleep so you don't cause accidents!!

But no, with a few hundred people on board, they mozy on off the train, have another person stroll on over and finish the last 15 minutes (1 mile) of the route.The trains themselves run every 20 minutes. In the third world it's every 2. The drivers slam the brakes constantly and everyone falls over each other. Then the doors open, and they stay open, sometimes for 5 minutes, often in fact. Just to waste everyone's time.It's swarming with drunks and homeless and the only thing the police are doing is checking whether the people rushing to their meeting in business suits paid the $1.75, oh thank heavens.The announcement system is basically random messages being played at random times about unrelated exits.I mean, it's a giant joke like out of some novel lampooning incompetence.

Place treat us with respect and I guarantee there will be more ridership.
89,2,"Oct 5, 2018",PROS: 1. I'm very happy they're building up the rail system again. At least there will be a better system in the future to look forward to.2. Cheaper than Uber and Lyft.CONS:1. Very long wait times for both trains and buses. The Red and Purple Lines should run every 5 minutes at night not every 20 minutes. 20 minutes is a lot of wasted time especially if you just missed a train. Blue and Expo lines have better service frequency but the trains move too slowly in Downtown L.A. Buses often run only every 45-60 minutes on Melrose Ave. west of Vine Street. Poor service frequency on Robertson Blvd. where buses only run once an hour and shut down on weekends. I stopped using most buses because of the long wait times and short-line service (where some buses only go to Vine St. which makes the wait times for West Hollywood double.) Uber is far more reliable. The free tap card passes and the rail system are the only reasons why I still take Metro.2. Elevator and Escalator breakdowns are a major problem in Metro stations especially if you have a bike or are wheelchair bound. The Red and Purple line stations are huge and deep. It's not always possible to take the stairs.3. Some Metro vehicles are in bad condition. Red and Purple line trains need to be refurbished. The floors are falling apart and decals peeling off. Some buses are too old and need to be replaced. Don't just put new CNG tanks on a 15 year old bus and put it back in service. Order new buses.I would support increased sales taxes for service improvements because I know most of these problems are mainly funding related.

Not anymore, I don't wanna go on a neighborhood tour before going to the airport for $30.  Nor do I want to go on a La Nauseè ride 6 times around the airport and a neighborhood tour coming home.  No Thanks.  Not when I can take the Metro and the FlyAway to the Airport.  Love this Gold Line.    The cars feel like a Disney ride..  still beaucoup fun.  Save money and you're contributing to the cause!  Hell yeah!Tip:  For travelers coming to El-Lay, you can take the LAX Flyaway to Union Station from LAX, and Metro it to downtown, Hollywood, Long Beach,  North Hollywood.  LA is no longer a car only town, of sorts.  Must get a Tap Card at Union Station to use the metro at  $1.50 per ride.  LAX Flyaway takes Debit/Credit Cards only, $8 one way."
97,5,"Jul 17, 2016","A must use to get around or as a supplement to Uber, Rental car, or Bus use. Parking and driving in certain areas can be horrendous. Easy to understand routes and purchase tickets. For the most part a clean, easy, quick ride. Seating can get limited during peak times, and make sure to bring sanitizer after holding onto bars or poles. There are some interesting characters, but there's no real way to prevent this so enjoy the people watching! *There are also quite a few people asking for money: As a safety precation do not take wallet or money out. Ladies keep purses secured infront of you because there is a lot of bumping and close contact as well as possible distractions, I'd imagine it would be easy for someone to slip a hand in a purse to grab various items without you paying attention to the movement."
98,1,"Jun 16, 2019",So I just moved to LA and I hate the metro its the worst ever and lord knows if you have to be work on a Sunday it's only one bus that runs where I live on Sundays to get me downtown to work. And when you go on your phone you know maps so you can plan your trip time a day early it told me that the 68 bus would come at 9:20am I was on the bus stop at 8:57am and the bus didn't come until 10:00am the bus driver going say oh well maps are wrong on Sunday but Monday Thur Saturday it's right I don't and then at night I just found out that a lot of the buses stop at 9:00pm at night this System is horrible it makes me want to move back to Baltimore they need to redo in Baltimore the all the busses run until 3am and on Sundays if one bus don't run they have two other buses that do

They hardly made any efforts to recover it, seemed obvious that someone on Metro's payroll snatched my bike up. I'll never trust to bring a bike onboard any Metro vehicles, rail or bus ever again. If a bike is left behind, riders should realistically be able to recover it. This kind of theft and corruption is a serious liability."

I know from last year that some of you are even going to take your little ones out past midnight. Here's some tips:Gold Line- Safest and cleanest of the many lines- 30 minutes from Sierra Madre Station to Union Station- May or may not come with crazy peopleRed Line- You lucky SOBs! If this were rush hour between the hours of 5 and 6 pm, you'd be squished in like sardines. Lucky for you, it will be 2 am when you get on.- About 30 minutes from Union Station to the North Hollywood station. Super convenient to get around Downtown. - Watch out for drunken SantasBlue Line- You may want to say a little prayer before getting on. you'll need some divine intervention to make it from Downtown to Long Beach without being bothered by gangsters, potheads, grownups selling candy, homeless people, crazy people, preachers, and dudes with boomboxes....yah, they still exist.- About one hour-ish to Long Beach. Expect an excruciatingly painful stop in Downtown as you watch dozens of people walk past you while you don't go anywhere. Expo Line- Through Downtown to USC - Blue Line applies- Past USC to Culver City - Gold Line appliesGreen Line- Someone's going to have to update me on that one...All lines:- Teenagers may or may not be annoying- Stay safe. Don't be so drunk you don't know your surroundings, or at least travel with someone who does. Have fun and Happy New Year!"
105,4,"Aug 2, 2011","OK. So sometimes you get  on a bus and it smells like  lord knows what. Sometimes there's nowhere to sit except for that one seat...wait...is that fresh gum? But honestly? How else can you get from one side of the city to the other on $1.50? If you plan it right, and take the right bus on Metro you can.For $6 (going back down to $5) you can travel anywhere your  little heart wants too... Little Tokyo for Boba? Down. Hop on the train Pasadena for Ice Cream? OK. Want to go be a tourist? Take the 780 and get dropped off in Hollywood. Good luck trying to do that in your car and having to fuss around with parking.I've been taking the bus for so long and honestly it is getting better. There are cameras on the bus, so you don't have to worry about stranger danger. Nexttrip allows you to find out when the next bus is coming (go to m.metro.net and then you can enter in your stop number or street names and find out when the next bus in either direction is coming.) For free. I've relied on this for a few trips and it is almost up to the minute (only one or two minutes delay).Guess what? Now if you smile at the bus driver and say ""hi"" 90% of the time they will say ""hi"" back.So get out of your car and jump on a bus and go exploring!"
106,3,"Apr 26, 2013","For the one city where traffic is among the nation's worst, one would think more folks would use the LA Metro. It's not as clean as DC's metro system, as simple as Boston's, or as vast or cost effective NYC, but LA does a solid job for what it is. The trains run on time, they're not disgusting, and not terribly crowded even during rush hour.But people in these parts love to drive. The search for the nearest subway stop doesn't sound as appealing as the allure of a luxury valet. Safety is a concern for the late commuters, but if you don't bother anyone else, it's pretty unlikely they'd bother you. It also might stop in a popular area, but considering the urbal sprawl of the city, it's not exactly convenient with out the aid of a bus for the more rural areas.Then there is the TAP card. Day passes are still available and the per ride requirement can be bypassed with the honor system. Plenty of people have cheated their way past turnstyles and have taken advantage of the fact there is very little staff and/or onboard maintenance. That said, I haven't had a problem with any stalled cars or track issues.If the LA Metro can't save the smog or win the respect of its city, here's hoping that things  change down the (subway) line."
107,4,"Aug 25, 2015","I grew up using the public transportation system that serves Los Angeles. I'm pretty sure just about everybody at some point has used it as well. The Metro system takes riders all throughout Los Angeles County. Fee is $1.75 for a one way Trip. You can purchase a tap card for $1 which is reusable. Just load it with money before using! Day pass I believe is still $7 . back in the day, it was $5. I can understand with the inflation rate as to why it goes up. I have used just about every single bus line. Depending on the day or time, they usually run every 10 mins. During the weekends and the wee hours, they run a bit longer. Just about anywhere you want to go throughout Los Angeles, the Metro bus takes you there. This is my go to method whenever I choose to bar hop. I rather never drive while inebriated so just Metro bus it! The bus drivers can be from nice and chatty to just plain quiet! No eating or drinking is allowed on the bus inside. I will continues to use the Metro bus system. Monthly passes can vary. I believe they still accept bus tokens as well!!!"
108,3,"Apr 17, 2009","So I've lived in LA for a little over 3 years now. Long enough to claim residence in 4 zip codes (moving sucks) and soon to be a 5th(eh). Until recently, whether or not my commute was 5 blocks or 15 miles, I had always driven.When I moved to LA near South Pasadena I realized I was a short 5 minute ride to the Mission St. Metro stop. I wanted to try and use the line, but it wasn't until I started a new job in Hollywood where I was finally able to utilize it on a daily basis.  So far it has been great. I wake up at 7:30, shower and dress. By 8 am I am out the door and at the Mission St stop by about 8:15. It takes a minute to walk from where you park because it's 4 hour parking near the station to avoid a parking cluster.I always bring a book and my IPOD shuffle. I can usually  even find a seat. By about 8:30-40 I am at Union Station where I switch to the Red Line. I get to my stop at Hollywood/Vine at around 9 or so.  Then I have a nice 10 minute walk down to Santa Monica Blvd.It's been great! I save 50 bucks a week on gas, so now I don't mind eating out for lunch all the time. I also get a nice workout and have lost about 10 pounds in 2 weeks.Fortunately and unfortunately, I just signed a lease back in Hollywood (ironically near the Hollywood and Vince stop) BUT i will now be walking to work and still not paying for Gas--booyah!--HOWEVER--I gotta be fair and honest. Not all is kosher down under. The cliental that rides the tube is sketchy at best. I've gotten threatening looks from Cholos, almost puked because of a stinky hobo who stood too close to me, and had a few looney tunes start conversations with me. I could see how a woman might not feel comfortable alone. But from what I understand they have camera and a guard on every train.Give the metro a look. Even if you can't take it to work, you can probably find a route you can use. For example I plan on walking to the Hollywood and Vince spot and taking it to the Sunset/Vermont stop to go out in Los Feliz where I have some friends. Or even one stop east of that to go to this dive bar, Smog Cutter (see review).  They are expanding the Metro so you might as get on board!"

143,2,"Feb 21, 2013","Dear Los Angeles Metro,I thought it would be fun to use public transportation for the day.  I see people do it on TV all the time.  However, it turned out that you are confusing as hell.  I was left fending for myself trying to figure out how you work.  So I bought myself a TAP card.  I was wondering if I can share a card and swipe it twice or do I need a card per person?  There was no one there for me to ask.  I had no clue where to swipe my card.  I saw someone swiping and I told my friend I think that round  thing is where you swipe.  She thought it was where you check to see how much money you have left.  She said I'm sure there is a turn stile that you tap to get through.  I asked a stranger that walked by,  he said just get on.  He never pays.  No one ever check on the weekend.  As tempting as it sounds, do I want to take that chance?  Failure to pay you can get fine up to $250 and 48 hours community service. Its only 1.50 to ride the metro, that's pocket change.   So I have my tap card, charged and ready to go.  Then I turned to my friend and asked  how do we know if we were going on the right train?  hmmm no one working to ask.  All I know is that I needed to take the gold line.  So I turned to some random stranger and said, ""Hey!  Where are you going?""  This lady said union station, I told her i was too and so we followed her like creepers.  I find it funny how ever time I asked a stranger where they were going they never hesitate to tell me.  I guess i'm not that suspicious looking.  I got on the metro.  made my way to the union station with my TAP card and all.  So it turned out that I meant to pay for my trip, but I never TAP my card because I'm clueless. That round thing that I saw  that was next to the TAP vending machine was where you were suppose to TAP. I actually played with it trying to figure out what it was for. I didn't know I was suppose to tap my card there.  It doesn't make sense.   I'm going to stick to driving, but I am still praying for teleportation."

It really discourages the honest people from even paying if no one else is paying. Yeah, there are cops there but not all the time...

It was such a pain driving from Claremont to Azusa and the traffic on the 210 corridor between Azusa and San Dimas shows that these cities need an AFFORDABLE subway-like public transit option. Compared to other city's public transportation costs, $1.75 is a deal! I use to pay $2.50+ for a one way trip back in 2009 for Tri-met in Portland, OR.

148,1,"Jan 17, 2019","Bus 210 is ALWAYS extremely LATE or doesn't show up at all. Don't even count on an on-time connection when having to take this bus. No matter what direction you're taking it, it has never been on time or even close to the time it's supposed to come. Horrible!!!"
149,1,"Oct 13, 2013",My  part of the metro busses is the part  favorite is where they kill your dog and the asswhole drivers don't bother to pull over.. idk what kind of training they recieve but I think the humane part is to pull over and make the report.. apparantly the report went out through drivers.. and no one knows who it is.. woww.. I'm amazed.. today at 3.00 recieved the call. And I don't look for money.. just a simply apology... they took a pet and a family member from us.. smh... go metro..
150,2,"Aug 10, 2012","If I had a car I would never even consider riding Metro. But since I don't have a car I must reply on Metro to get to where I need to be. The bus operators are rude and most times can be very nasty. Trains are never on time and just the other night I was stuck on the red line for 20 minutes and the conductor (if you can call them that) never said one word as to what was going on or when the train would move again. The cost to ride metro is far too much and TAP is a huge joke. Half the time my card never even give me the green ""enter"" light to get on. Even though it gets loaded every month.Security on METRO is the worst. In fact there is no such thing. The only thing I;ve ever seen the so called security or police do is write out tickets. Making sure the stations are safe and secure is not their number one priority. In fact I dont think it is a priority at all.The whole ""see something say something"" is nothing more then a poor attempt to make people feel safe. Who the heck are you supposed to say something to? There are no agents. Then they give you a number to call the police, but that is no good when you're underground.I've been on the Red, Blue and now the Expo Lines when fights have broken out. It takes the train operator forever to even answer the call button.If you ever try to use their trip planer it gives you routes that take forever. For example I wanted to get to Malibu from Hollywood. It had me walk 4 blocks down to Sunset to get the 2 or 302 and then transfer to the 217 or 780 to Venice and Fairfax to get the 534 to Malibu. I could have just taken the 2 or 302 to PCH and caught the 534 to Malibu, but this was not an option.Santa Monica Municipal Bus Line (Big Blue Bus) is far superior to Metro. Their buses are on time, clean, safe and the drivers are friendly and very helpful. I was so happy when Big Blue Bus introduced the 7 Rapid to the Wilshire and Western Station. I wish they could run buses to Hollywood where I live. But I will soon be back in Santa Monica where I will never have to ride metro unless I want to"
151,2,"Aug 6, 2011","Right now I'd like a seat for Bitter, table of one.Sorry L.A. Metro, but you've lost some business to a customer who will now be treating L.A. to more smog and traffic. Over the last month I decided to take the bus much more often, but have been met with many buses being incredibly late, and two not showing up at all; Totally inexcusable for a metro line. Just now it cost me a ticket on Amtrak that I pre-paid for, since the 10 bus decided not show up at all to go to Union Station. Yes, I absolutely made sure I had the right bus, bus stops, and times. Maybe L.A. Metro has something against Santa Monica? Hey, I can't help it if it the air is better here.What a bummer. If I can't depend on a bus system to get me where I need to go at the time I need to get there, why would I ever want to use it? I still use it now and then, but my desire to be more car-free simply can't be fulfilled with a bus system like this."
152,5,"May 7, 2008","Driving the 101 is not pretty. Getting the 20 miles from our home in Woodland Hills to Hollywood can take anywhere from 30 minutes to and hour and a half... and you never know which to expect. So, when we go to the Pantages or El Cap to see a show, we just always leave 90 minutes (or more!) ahead. Getting to the Dorothy Chandler can take up to 2 hours. Then you have to find a spot to park the car and pay about $12 for the privilege.We've been eyeing the Warner Transportation Center and the Metro Orange Line for some time as a possible alternative. So, this past Monday we decided to ride it all the way to Union Station (which includes a transfer in N. Hollywood to the Metro Red Line) and get some Cielito Lindo taquitos to celebrate Cinco De Mayo.Buying tickets is easy. The machine is intuitive and accepts cash, coins and cards. One way is $1.25. An all day pass is $5. Metro Orange Line buses leave about every 8-10 minutes or so. They're comfortable enough, though not plush. The ride from Woodland Hills to N. Hollywood took about 40 minutes. The transfer to the Red Line was painless and the ride from N. Hollywood to Union Station took another 35 minutes for a total 1 hour 15 minutes from Woodland Hills to Union Station. That is about the same time it would take in a car! Plus, I didn't have to find and pay for parking when I got there. Frankly, unless we need the car to get around once we get downtown, I don't see any reason to not take the Metro. It's just as fast, and with the price of gasoline and parking... CHEAPER!We need to visit a friend in Long Beach soon. I think we can take the Metro all the way in about 2 hours for $1.25 per person each way. That's a $5 round trip from Woodland Hills to Long Beach in about the same time it would take me to drive. What's not to love?"
155,4,"May 28, 2008","It has a long way to go to be as good as other cities. But they are doing a really good job doing that as fast as they can. This is no easy task.It would be even better if people just used it more. I have lived in LA for a year and have found no reason yet to own a car. It's not super convenient but neither are gas prices, car maintenance, and insurance. With a little research and an open mind I recommend it to everyone. So look into it the next time you want to go to a museum, or shopping, or work. It may or may not save you time, but it will for sure save you money.Basically, it gets a bad rap. The metro here is good, not great, but for sure user friendly and improving every month."
156,1,"May 18, 2018",Worst public transportation out there. Buses are gross and smell like piss. They let all the homeless on for free and they piss all over the buses. None of them are ever on the right time schedule either early or late and you never make the connecting buses because of it
157,5,"Dec 17, 2018","My car had just died, no warning, just died on the 101 freeway.  I was about a 1/2 mile from my intended off ramp when the electrical system died. Got the car to the side of the road and my wife was calling AAA.  Just then, out of the blue Enrique Nava pulled up behind me in his truck (29-A).  He got out, we talked through the issue and he tried to jump the car, to no avail.  He said he wanted to see if charging for 15 minutes would do the trick.  Then AAA showed up.  I was impressed that he spent 15 minutes of unscheduled time to attempt to get me on my way. I didn't even know about the Metro program, but couldn't be more pleased.  Now if DMV workers could only take lessons on how to be accommodating AND nice to the public from Enrique/Metro, would really be great.  But, the only thing worse that TSA agents are DMV workers.  The opposite of TSA / DMV, Enrique.  Thx."

159,1,"Oct 14, 2007","After growing up in LA, when I moved back here, I was super excited that there was now a subway and light rail and such.But after a year of using them... I have NO IDEA how they got the America's Best title. Have you ever actually tried to get anywhere via the Metro?Today, I left my house at 10am. I came home at 10pm. I spent 2 hours at my destination.It took me 5 hours of bullshit to get from the Valley to Torrance, both ways. One bus never came, the lady at 1-800-COMMUTE gave me the wrong bus number, the bus lady dropping me off in such a way that I'd have to pay the special freeway cost TWICE in once direction despite my day pass (What is the point of a $5 day pass if you are just gonna have to pay more anyway), and the web trip planner leaves a lot to be desired (Google, do it right before I get stranded too many more times).Anyway, there's a reason people drive in LA. It's cause for most trips, it's the only way that isn't gonna make you in-freaking-sane."
160,5,"Jul 11, 2008","I'm not going to take it for trips lasting more than one hour, but anything less is just fine. People bitch and moan about Metro. Sure. It sucks if you're stuck on it for more than an hour. I'm not going to take Metro from the South Bay to the SFV. For short hauls (i.e., thirty minute trips or less), it's not that big of a deal. The 704 (Santa Monica Blvd.) is great in terms of getting to Century City or Santa Monica. The 33/333 (Venice Blvd.) is great to get to the Venice Beach and the Promenade from Palms. Sitting on the bus with my iPod is much better than dealing with L.A. drivers, dealing with traffic, and looking for parking. When I was in college, my thought on taking the Wilshire buses was ""why take the bus when it can just take as long as driving your car?"" My thought now: ""why take your car when it can just take as long as riding the bus?"""

They are neglecting security on the train and need to be checking passes to see if some people even belong on it by checking to see if they paid, there are passengers annoying real riders, asking for money, selling crap or putting all their stuff on the seats when they likely haven't  paid to be on the train. I saw a rider threatening another rider. If someone says something on the intercom the drivers either can't hear them or they don't do anything. They broadcast a phone number to call if you see anything but there is no way to text this number, this is bad because what if someone doesn't want other passengers to know they are calling. People hang around on the platform and don't appear to be riders, I have seen people sleeping on benches, I saw one guy laying on the ground in front of a bench so no one could sit on it. They have all these cameras, why aren't they watching? I see all these cops standing around a Union Station when they need to be visible on the trains! I've seen them looking at their phones , even flirting with girls!"

164,4,"Mar 10, 2013",Where else am I going to ride the subway in California? In LA that's where. I was fortunate to ride the metro to go to Universal Studios the previous summer and I had a blast. Although it can be a bit crowded at certain stops but I guess thats the how it is when you ride the subways isn't it?
167,1,"Dec 15, 2017","Why is Los Angeles Metro's subway/light rail system a radial system instead of a grid/network.  It's frustrating and waste of time to having to go to union station first every single time to transfer to another subway line! In the old days city blooms naturally around railroad stops. New construction seems like they are always an after-the-fact catch up effort which results in endless delays due to unsettled negotiation or opposition among Metro, local residents and government agencies.  We already see big migration waves toward the east side into San Bernardino County in housing and job markets, do the counties and Metro have any plan to set a few additional central station and subway grid from the east side BEFORE it gets overpopulated again? If not, it's just a matter of time before the east side roads get congested again with horrible traffic."

169,2,"Mar 7, 2016","I used the Metro to get around Los Angeles for the duration of my trip. The system doesn't reach a lot of places in LA, and the scheduled arrivals have some wait time in between. I like the TAP cards, and rides are considerably cheaper than what I'm used to. I think that having agents walk around checking everyone's card is dumb, but to each their own. The trains are pretty consistent, and clean. I'd recommend adding half and hour or more to bus times. Don't rely on their tracking app. I was waiting on an 8:30pm bus to New Gardena. At 8:30, the bus's arrival time changed to 9:00. Then 10:00. Then 5:00am the next day. I saved myself the trouble and just called an Uber. The metro will kind of get you to where you need to be, just be ready to do a lot walking and a lot of waiting."
170,1,"Sep 13, 2017",How many times do you have to screw people over with fare charges and not allow any sort of notice that a train is down before entering the metro stations? Worst transportation service!
171,3,"May 1, 2011","LA is pretty large. I barely made a dent venturing into new neighborhoods while taking Metro. There are so many routes, that it can be quite confusing figuring which ones to take for the uneducated traveller.Without doing research, you would be better sticking to the Metro train lines, visiting the neighborhoods nearby and getting back on the Metro train to head elsewhere. Unfortunately, West LA is not served very well by Metro trains, so you would need to take buses to get there. And there lies the problem. Some routes take far too long. To save time, look for Metro Rapid Service buses to shave some time off. At least they have routes that have 24 hour service if you need it. You can't say that for many cities around the country.Bus fares are pretty reasonable though. $1.50 one-way, $6 for an all day fare. Much more affordable than King County Transit in my area and without a freaking Orca card to have to use.Compared with King County Transit, LA Metro is not that bad. Fares are reasonable and the system seems to go everywhere. You just need to plan ahead of time in getting around town so you don't waste your time on getting there as opposed to being where you want to be."

You can't sit on seats by Alameda entrance cuz that's for ""Amtrak or Metrolink"" ticket holders, even though they have a huge section of seats that roped off! The subway now runs every 20 minutes! They are gyping people by offering less yet they charge more. What's the kicker is they hire police to GIVE tickets INSTEAD of protecting the passengers. The cops hang out by the exit to check your fare. Many people have been groped, harrassed, and assaulted. WTF is security on the subway????"

I'm sure Chicago would never do that, but than again did LA do it or was it SHM? Either way THANKS!The metro trains are extremely quiet. You can barely hear them arrive and it's such a smooth ride compared to Chicago's ""L"" lines. They're old school, nothing modern, spacious and even with the concert going on it didn't get overwhelmingly crowded on a Saturday night.Whoot! Thanks for the free and smooth ride to and from the concert!"
174,3,"Oct 20, 2012","While it's not where I would want it to be, it's at least getting there. Currently the whole thing is basically one big honor system - which does mean that any joe average can just walk onto any train. In all my times I have been on the system, it has never shown me any enforcement of someone checking for proof of fare. If anything,t he metro system is just a bit on the lawless wild wild west side. It's like being in an unincorporated territory during the gold mining days. You didn't know when a hooplehead was going to come and try to lay claim to your... claim. Only for you to answer back with a buckshot to their face. What I'm trying to say with all these metaphors is that the Los Angeles Metro system is full of cocksuckers. But that doesn't mean you can't ride it. I certainly have never been flashed. Though I did once see someone squat in the corner... I'll let your imagination fill in the rest of the sad and terrifying picture. I do think that if they had turnstiles or even some means to enforce people paying for the fare, that they could get rid of a lot of the riffraff that is currently wandering about on these trains day in and day out. Also, could you NIMBY's stop being - as the folks of Deadwood would say, Cocksuckers. And just allow the construction around your area. South Pasadena did it, why can't you? You're holding up progress here!"

And sometimes they just drive by and dont pick you up (usually that happens when youre in in the worst parts of town that youre desperately trying to escape)"
179,4,"Dec 14, 2008","I like the idea of public transportation. It was great in NYC; it's okay here. There's something to be said about the hum of a city that has millions of people moving together. Well, here in LA I suppose it's a few thousand. Either way, it serves it purpose and can work if YOU make lifestyle adjustments. Example: I'm trying to incorporate public transportation in my work commute at least once a week. I commute 15 miles (25 minutes) across the SFV. Now, I'm waking up earlier, getting home later, standing in the cold, using a bike, and commuting for 85 minutes one way. Is it inconvenient? Not that much. Is it hard? Not really. I'm getting some ""me"" time in during the morning and afternoon. I have time to read that book I've been meaning to get to and riding a bike 3.6 miles to get home (so I'm tricking myself into getting in some cardio!). It really is a lifestyle change (and the commute is nice reminder of my NYC days). It's a challenge to really make it work for you, but you have to at least try."
180,3,"Oct 10, 2011","Growing up in the Bay Area, I was fortunate enough to experience the awesomeness that is Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART). If it's going to an Oakland A's game or hitting up a show at Maritime Hall...BART was usually the way to go when it came to a non-driving option. LA's version of BART, the multifaceted LA Metro system holds some water when comparing the two public transit systems. Although that glass isn't too big when looking to fill it. I've taken Metro's Blue Line from Long Beach to LA / Hollywood quite a few times for several anti-war protests and most recently, Occupy LA at City Hall. I've never had a problem with Metro as a service itself. The act of transferring from the light rail Blue Line to the BART-like Red Line at 7th Street is really easy, even when my most recent experience included a portion of the Blue Line being shut down for some construction issues, Metro staff made the task of finding the shuttle bus and knowing where to go quite pleasant. I've also never really experienced any time delays with service either. Now if I relied on Metro to get to and from work, riding it daily, I might have a different opinion. With that being said, there are a few things I feel I must address. First of all, with the exception of a few LA Sheriff Officers patrolling stations (mainly making sure people have tickets), security seems a little sparse. Especially on the trains. Being how anyone can essentially ride Metro without a ticket...this leaves for people to take advantage of the situation. I think this is mainly as issue I've seen on the Blue Line. Let's not beat around the bush, the Blue Line goes through some pretty sketchy areas. This leads me to my next talking point...while there's a station right next to The Staples Center, I wouldn't take The Blue Line to a Laker's night game. Rolling through Compton at 11:30 PM doesn't sound like a good time to me. At least when I was on BART coming home from a show in San Francisco...I know that BART Police are on guard. Lastly, the idea that So. Cal doesn't have an area wide public transit system is quite sad. Nothing going into Orange County from LA County. They really need to expand Metro's service to neighboring counties and communities...like BART has in the Bay Area. Metro is a nice way to get into the LA / Hollywood area without driving...especially for day trips. Beyond that, unless you have more balls than I, it's ONLY for day trips. Otherwise it's a decent system."
181,4,"Dec 21, 2013","The service is getting better and better.  I usually take the Gold Line to Union Station when I need to be downtown LA.  A few years back, it took me about an hour and now it is only taking 20 minutes.  The Union Station area has cleaned up really well.  It can be pretty intimidating getting into Union Station with people bustling about.  Well a few days ago, there was the Salvation Army band playing Christmas songs and it was nice way of getting into the holiday spirit.  For the most part, people are pretty friendly, but you get some peculiar people who look like ex-cons or homeless who want to talk to you onboard, but that is something that is beyond Metro's control.And I agree with some of the bad reviews who make the claim there are no instructions on how to board or attendant helping out.  You'll have to do your research online on how to take it and through trial and error.  That is just how you learn and once you get used to it, it is a pretty convenient way of getting around."
182,3,"Jun 29, 2008","I am SUCH a fan of public transportation. I can't speak for how the Metro runs during the week, but on the weekend the metro from Glendale is sadly inefficient. Although the station is pretty and the hedges are trimmed and it has this manicured feel, the trains don't run very frequently (and are often late). Plus, it's about 6 bucks for a roundtrip ticket to Union Station. And it's hard if you take the train in during the day and want to stay later into the night (the last train back to Glendale on Saturday was at 9PM...Seriously!). There was an article in the LA times recently about taking the metro late night, well, 9PM is NOT late night people. No way. Still. I can wish, can't I? The Glendale station is within walking distance from my apartamento, so I really, really WANT to take the metro, but not if the trains run irregularly and the round trip ticket is more than three bucks. That's just silly. Still. I like public transportation. I really, really do. I'm not going to give up on LA's yet...I can only hope it will improve in the future. If I lived downtown; however, I would definitely take the metro to get where I want to go. From Union Station we took the red line to Pershing Square and it was pretty efficient."

The Gold Line is my favorite maybe because of the air conditioning.

If you're hungry/thirsty, there's a Starbucks, Subway, Famina, Wetzel's Pretzels, and Ben & Jerry's on the Alameda entrance side (plus Traxx) and vending machines on the Gateway side.Platforms may be confusing so don't be afraid to ask for help.

I've taken the red line from Studio City to Hollywood a couple of times and the bus service that runs on Ventura and neither were bad or delayed. They were clean too. I've also taken the red line and purple line downtown. That was ok. However, the signs were lacking for direction at the Wilshire/Westlake station. I wasn't sure what platform to be on or which stairs to take to get to what train. I ended up following someone I overheard talking about what train they were taking. The buses are pretty straight forward. Pick a stop, read the map, trace your path to where you want to go, switch buses if needed. I haven't gotten the hang of the timing of the buses yet but I will. Easy to transfer to the trains too since the buses meet up with their stops. Also, the TAP card is nice in that you can just add money to it without buying a pass.

For any L.A. visitor, all you'll need to navigate your way through the trains is a bit of research, possibly a smartphone/navigator or simply put that aside and grab a map and a compass and you're good to go! My parents and I opted to do things the old fashion way. We were on vacation and wanted to be away from technology as much as possible. We hopped on the gold and silver lines on the first day, tried the red and purple lines the next day and ended our vacation with the expo line to Culver City. All trains arrived promptly. Had a fun time at the purple line when this one guy got up his chair and called out to everyone else that he had a 'snoop doggy dog' song tucked under his sleeve. Without hesitation, he began to rap - to the annoyance of some commuters. I found it hilarious! He ended his song with a short speech about how he need some 'Mickey D's' and proceeded to ask for tips! We had to get off the next station just as he was about to start another Johnny Cash song. He ought to be doing that around Vegas, don't you think?"
195,2,"Oct 4, 2017",LA is too spread out so the metro doesn't go everywhere.  They are adding more lines so that is good.  If you want to take certain lines there's no parking and the lines that have parking available charge a fee.  Buying a round trip ticket is not clear on the screen.  You have to look up above over your head on the ticketing machine for some instructions and then look down at the screen.  This makes the line long as many people who don't ride it regularly don't know what to do.  Why not have all instructions on the screen where everyone is looking.  With time perhaps improvements will be made.
196,4,"Aug 13, 2009",I have one advice for taking the metro. Research your route online BEFORE getting on. It will save you time and headache when getting around.The fact that you can get to major places WITHOUT a car in LA is pretty amazing. The only thing I absolutely hate is the friggin' gang-bangers and crazy bums/people riding. Hey!....stop looking at my pockets and shoes! No you can't steal them....I will kick your ass!
197,5,"Sep 12, 2013","Oh the Metro Gold Line, how do I love thy. You get me from home to the Metro Red Line daily. Even on the warmest of days, you only sort smell like urine. Sure you may be above ground so you must stop at every street but you make up for it with you spotty 3G coverage allowing your riders to unabashedly browse red tube, you porn and other mobile porn streams. More cops per rider than other line? Oh yeah Goldie's got it all. Don't pet the trained Bomb dogs or you will draw back a stump. Lol.   Seriously though. What other line will you see Tia Carrera sitting next a nodding junkie. Pasaenda to some where in east la. Your my favorite train line for realz."
198,4,"Nov 17, 2014","We wanted to visit and stay in downtown LA to get a better feel for this nearby metropolitan area.In order to avoid driving (and parking) we decided to use public transport.We took the Amtrak from Irvine to Union Station.  We then used the Metro subway for much of our travel the next few days.I was pleasantly surprised (after reading some reviews).  After a small learning curve with the Tap system, we found our train which was better marked than other systems I have used (NYC, BART).  The subway was reasonably clean.  We had stops right across from our downtown hotel (the Sheraton) and where we wanted to mainly go (Hollywood & Highland).My only gripe was why they don't police if people are paying the fare?!?!?  We saw dozens of people easily walk right past the turnstiles without paying.  This added to crowded trains and, in my opinion, invited individuals who didn't care at all about their fellow riders.  My wife and I did get checked for tickets once...on our return trip to Union Station.  Enforce the fare and use the funds to maintain the cars, security and keep sufficient capacity.Otherwise I was very happy with LA's subway system."
199,1,"Dec 14, 2017","i was in bus number 20(downtown la) today around 2pm. i should say that stop hiring those black homeless and rude people in your company! a black driver woman assaulted me without reason! be aware of these black drivers! not only that rude woman, many other black drivers act like they are the bosses of the bus. instead they should know that they are serving!!!i said this woman ""do not touch me"", she said"" you are rude as woman"". in that case, she is the one rude one. she grab my arm like a criminal. no apology accepted!"
200,3,"Jul 20, 2014",So i blew off a saturday afternoon and decided to see where the 210 bus goes its basically a north-south route running between the south bay and ending at the hollywood/vine metro station. Sum it up the route goes from decent to ghetto and back to decent. If you are a bbq fan this is a good ride to take especially the number of places i saw around leimert park with wacked out names i would expect a soul food joint to have. As for the jim crow situation you were better off sitting in the back of the bus since the air conditioning worked better.
201,3,"Jul 16, 2007","Having been spoiled by the BART and MUNI services of the Bay Area, one can easily be lulled into thinking ways to make it soo much better, or come up with small complaints.Take a weekend trip to LA......  wow...... we have it pretty good.  The Los Angeles area is definetly NOT pedestrian friendly, TAXIs will cost you more than almost anything else on your trip.  So on one of the days, we decide to use the Metro, as a way to snub our nose at the taxis fares.... until we realize that we have to take a taxi to the metro station from our hotel.... 10.00.  Then we arrive at a green line station... okay no problem, looks like our BART system...kik ass... until we go to buy tickets, of the 4 machines, none are working 100% as they will not take credit cards... although when working properly they do.  Its 1.25 to ride the system, cheaper than BART... hmmm maybe they have something here... up to the platform, no display to tell you how long to wait..... what seems like forever, a MUNI like train pulls up, which being near the endline is now almost full.  The trains are narrow and slow.  We ride that to the Blue line transfer, where we go down stairs into a very seedy neighborhood where we have to wait for the blue train under the overheard line of the green line..... not if you'll get mugged, but when....  the blue line pulls up, jam packed, and the BO smell is nauseating.  The train is slow, very slow... oh shit, get me off the thing, there are about 40 people on here, that have not showered in a week.  At the red line transfer, the system looks more like our Bart, as the train is longer to accommodate more people, but filthy..... the stench of the passengers is more tolerable, but you feel like you need a shower after the whole ride, and it takes so long, I don't know how anyone could use the system efficiently.  For a city so large, and in California, I was expecting more from it.  Website is very good for trip planning, so I will give them kudos for that.... but three stars, as they have mass transit, which is more than I can say for Detroit (other than bus and the peoplemover) but definitely not what you would expect for a city of its caliber."
204,1,"May 21, 2019","Metro buses have the rudest, most unhelpful drivers I've ever had to deal with. For a job the requires you to interact with the public you should at least act like you are polite and helpful. Where do you find these employees Metro? Did you put out a help wanted ad that said ""If you hate dealing with people with got just the job for you"". I know that there are some nice friendly drivers out there but you guys are really hard to find. Most of the Metro drivers I've encountered are seriously the rudest people I've ever met. I'm not sure if it's just the hatred of their job or if they they just hate people but they seriously need to go. These people wouldn't last a day at any retail store treating customers they way they do so why do they get away with it at Metro? I'm sick of it and im not gonna take it anymore. I encourage everyone who has ever had a negatiive experience with a Metro driver to get they're badge # bus # name and route and make a formal complaint to Metro and then maybe we can force Metro to finally start firing these rude, nasty attitude drivers."
205,5,"Mar 26, 2008","is the shittttttttttt!i go to school right across the street from the Vermont and Wilshire stop and take the metro all the time. 7th and Fig is a greaaaaaaat stop for lunch with sooooo many choices. Pershing Square is great too, its got a dirt cheap market and authentic mexican foods for cheapp. Its the best way to get around in LA. and for going out at night is great too becuase you can hope on from the NoHo station in the valley and get off at Hollywood and Vine and boom, youre smack in the center of all the action. (just remember winter hours last train runs at 12:13am, butttt in the summer it runs until 4am) plusssss it minimizes the risk of getting a DUI (i got one, take it form me, they suck so much i would give it 5 negative stars if i could yelp it)so yeaaa... no worries about traffic or parking prices, just quick and effecient."
206,3,"Aug 2, 2009","I've been using the MTA ever since arriving here some decade and a half ago from the east coast and I must say that the transportation system that they have here in the west coast is inferior to what they have in the east coast. In any case, not much can be helped. After a little over 15 years of riding the Metro, I can honestly say that many of the comments that were made by reviewers here are accurate. Buses: They never arrive on the time they are supposed to arrive so the timetables that you see on those pieces of paper? Don't rely on them. Use them as a guide. If it is says it'll arrive at 8:15am, it'll be plus or minus 30 minutes. So always arrive at least thirty minutes early from the time that the bus is ""supposed"" to arrive so that you don't miss it in case if it comes early--because the bus drivers don't give a rats ass if they are ""on schedule"" or not. Bus Drivers: A lot of the bus drivers don't know LA very much or the cities which their bus route is on. They only know the ""general"" bus route that they are supposed to go. That's it. If you're a newcomer to commuting by bus, you have a 50/50 chance that they can or cannot help you. And don't expect them to know which buses you need to transfer to once you get off the bus. A lot of them simply don't know, some don't really care, and the rest are just disgruntled bus drivers and they'll purposefully try to get you lost just because they had a bad day. I've had it happened to me too many times to remember in the 15 years I've been using the Metro. Also, if the bus driver doesn't see you at the stop, he or she will drive past it without stopping. So be visible at the stop and extend your arm out to signal to the bus driver that you want to board that bus. Metro Rail: Out of all the negatives I've pointed out so far, the rail has never disappointed me. They are generally quite consistent. They usually take something like 15-25 minutes to arrive at each station. You should get to the station at least 10 minutes early from the time the rail is supposed to arrive. Oh, and it's not unusual to find a few crackheads, hookers, hobos, drug dealers, and crazy people on board the rail at any given time. So if you're a female riding the train alone, I'd suggest standing or sitting near other regular people for your own safety and do carry plenty of pepper spray. Better yet, bring a stun gun. =DUnion Station: Don't use the restrooms in the main hall. If you have to go badly, use the restroom at the very back of the building after you past the hallway where all the trains are located at. That's probably the only restroom I know about that is remotely clean and not a lot of people use. The other ones at the main hall are a garbage dump--literally. Be prepared to smell a whiff of human fecal matter, trash, sewage, and other unpleasant smells. It's hobo heaven in there. Also, guard your belongings. Theft is common here. There are so many people coming in and out of this place that almost everyone appear as if they are running away from something. Oh, and if you're going to walk into the hallway where the trains are located at, be prepared because people there will literally elbow you or shove you out of their way to get to their destination. If you have to walk through there, walk fast in any single direction. All in all, if you don't have a car, or you're trying to save money, or if you just want to get from point A to point B and time isn't an important factor, then the Metro will do just that. Just don't expect great customer service, reliability, or consistency."

208,2,"Nov 1, 2016",For some reason these trains are frequently inconsistent with their published schedules. The gold line Atlantic station trains do not depart when they're supposed to.  Sometimes departing too early and too late despite the fact that the train is already stationed.
209,3,"Jun 25, 2015",I have been taking Metro since the 1970's used to be called RTD back in the day! Now as far as waiting for buses I always wait for the number 230 to go to Studio City its either on time or late one time it was 30 minutes late and I had to meet someone at a certain time but luckily my friend was understanding about the situation! And also please have more security at Metro Line Stations cause I have seen many many people not Tap there Tap Card nor pay for there fare and this happens quite a lot especially when you go to the Universal City Station everyone runs to the train without paying and its a shame to see that there's no one there to stop these people
210,1,"Jun 6, 2013","This company get one star for:Lack of security- surveillance cameras doesnt deter crime. Alot of weirdos board buses and trains to harass passengers. People who do not pay the fare can just walk right on through the turnstile since they are not locked, but its $250 fine if a person doesn't pay. As a matter of fact, I have seen people walk through the turnstile without paying and sheriff's deputies doesn't do anything.Lost and Found- This place doesn't have a direct number, it only has an online system to put your claim through  for them to find that item, and Metro tells you that they will contact you if they have found it. Well, I had lost my keys on the bus a few weeks ago and was never contacted. I had personally gone down there to the Metro center at Wilshire and La Brea to see if they had my keys and they did. This system just sucks."
211,4,"Dec 11, 2008","an underground railway system in a city notorious for earthquakes. i have got to meet the person who started the metro in la. that person has a wicked sense of humor. my first trip on the metro was the red line from hollywood and western to hollywood and vine. not a very significant distance but parking in hollywood is appalling on the weekend; so i figured why not give this a try. i was impressed at how clean the station was. probably because public transportation in la is an urban myth to most. but aside from the red line, the routes which the trains took don't appear to be all that conducive to traveling all over la. especially from areas north like pasadena to west la like santa monica. however, i'll still use the metro when i go to hollywood, heck of a lot less stressful than having to meander through tourist traffic and jockeying for ten dollar parking."
212,1,"Apr 15, 2016","Why do LA Metro hates their handicapped customers?.If you happen to be a handicapped or dissabled individual, and in need of using the LA Metro, please be aware of the following; LA Metro does not care about you. It does not matter that there are Federal regulations in place to allow the handicapped a modicum of safety and security as well as securement areas designated for the hansdicapped only. LA Metro, one of the largest public transportation providers in the Nation, does not care to inform nor to educate its riders and customers, about the needs of the dissabled. How difficult could it be to add a recorded message to remind people to be polite an to allow the spaces predesignated for the use of the handicapped only, to be use by the handicapped passengers. This is not to much to ask, unless you happen to be unfortunate enough to need to travel via LA Metro. They expect the handicapped to hold on tight for dear life, rather than institute an informational and educational program to emphasized the obvious needs of the handicapped. The LA Metro leadership needs to evolve and realise that we are now living in a 21st Century, and that we no longer hide the handicapped from plain view. We the dissabled,are not second class citicens, but LA Metro is providing a second class service."
213,4,"May 28, 2012","Easy Day CommuteI'm a NYer, so I think I can confidently say that I'm a pro at public transportation. The Metro is not in any way shape or form as impressive as mass transit back east, but for car crazy LA- its the little engine that could. I live 8 miles from my job, 15 min drive no traffic- but that never happens so I go metro 5 days a week to save $, time, and sanity. The red line connects North Hollywood (and the valley via easy transfer to the Orange Line) Hollywood, & Koreatown to DTLA. It's a no brainier to sitting on the 101 in traffic, especially with ample parking in North Hollywood. The trains run every 10 mins during the day and have space in each car for bikes. Although the red line runs underground, most of the stations are wheelchair accessible.During the morning and early evening commutes, the train is full but with professional/working/students type. The evening hours get a little 'colorful' depending what station (7th & Metro and Pershing Square.....can get creepy) I took a star off for minimal security and lack of patrols. Although, I would advise against trying to get a free ride, the sheriffs dept is frequently out checking tickets or TAP cards- a $150+ fine and a trip in handcuffs is NOT worth it.Bonus points for being inexpensive ($1.50 per ride, $5 day pass) and for a lot of employers reimbursing for a monthly TAP pass. Plus i can listen to podcasts, music or just zone out on my commute vs being frustrated at the wealth of idiots with a drivers license. As far as I'm concerned, the metro is a good way to go!"

There are still too many hustlers on the Metro Rail cars( those running shell and card games who solicit illegal bets) or just plain setting up shop selling who knows what in the train cars. MTA seems to be all about security nowadays but seems to react only when forced to. Someone at the agency needs to tell the hustlers that Metro Rail no longer welcomes them aboard.

220,5,"Oct 4, 2007","Reading back on my past reviews, I noticed my tendency to provide more details on the people in the establishment I am reviewing  than the actual establishment. Blame this on my sociology major, but I am a people fanatic! My obsession with observing the folk has lead me to a passionate love for the Los Angeles Metro. The movie Crash made it clear that the Los Angeles driving population is lonely. The hours I spend in my car each day are void of any human interaction. The Los Angeles Metro system has restored my faith in human connection! The metro is slow, and its stops are limited, but it is a chance to talk to fellow humans. Over the course of my few metro rides I have had a number of riveting conversations and exchanges. The last time I rode an older woman and I together stared fearfully at an abandoned bag for the course of our entire ride. We chatted amiably about the possibility of a bomb exploding in the train and burning us to bits. We giggled the whole way! I imaging you could meet your true love on the metro. Why go to clubs or coffee shops when your future mate could be with you on your ride home from work. I only wish I could ride the metro more, but unfortunately it does not yet come out to the westside."
221,1,"Jul 26, 2012","I did not start taking the Metro until 2008. Not surprisingly, I'm now officially over it.Beginning in 2010, I started taking Metro buses and Rail everywhere since I didn't have a license and I began going to college. I pretty much am on MTA every single day. All I have to say to summarize my experiences: varied and inconsistent. Sometimes buses come too early or too late. I've had times when I was just across the street or down from an arrival and they left even though the listings cited they were not coming for another 5 minutes. Then there are some buses that can be as late as 20 minutes or don't show up at all.Twice a bus driver snapped at me, ""What does that mean? I don't understand."" because I told them I didn't have enough change. Well yes, this isn't a special needs class. I mean what I say. The policy of exact change is annoying. I've either put in too much or too little a handful of times. They need a change machine or something.Some drivers are bitchy, some are rude, some are kind, some are happy. You never know what you're going to get. I've had drivers that were maps of the area, and others that wouldn't even answer me. I'm paying you... do your job right. I asked one if they got interviews and training and he said yes. Another said they just get so bored doing the same thing over and over. Actually, your job is easier than many others... you operate a ride for everybody even though it does get old.Also, I heard that many drivers drive way too fast. Often, handicapped people fall out of the weak straps. When I was younger I noticed the bus did not offer better securement, which did prove to be a problem. No seat belts. One time I was on Hollywood and Western and one elderly man actually fell because the driver sped away when he was trying to sit down. The top of his head cracked open and bled, driver wasn't allowed to drive for some time, and an ambulance came while we all got on another bus. Everyone talked about lawsuits.Anybody can ride a bus or train, and that includes homeless people. Not specific to LA but a lot of people have mental issues and don't drive. Yep, you'll see them on here. Drivers aren't allowed to kick them off since they scrape up the greens (only $1.50) or they beg their way in. Don't be surprised if you see people asking you out or asking for money during your ride. Disturbing? Distracting? Yeah, I know.Everyone screaming that Metro helps combat traffic, not really. Some parts of Koreatown, Downtown, and West LA are still pretty bad especially after the mornings. Appointments become more of a problem. I am in no way biased, I have friends who live in DTLA and Pasadena and they rely soly on the Metro system to get around. If you're lucky enough to have such systems closer to you, you can get anywhere in under 20 minutes. The only good thing is that this gets you to places and you don't have to park."
222,1,"Jul 20, 2008","last night we waited at the bus stop at sunset/alvarado for a good 45 minutes for the number 4 bus to take us to santa monica.  we had checked it out online before walking to the bus stop and it said that there'd be a bus every 10-15 minutes, so we weren't all too concerned about getting there on time.i called the 800 number, navigated my way thru the touch-tone system so that i could ask an operator specifically what time the bus would be there, and after 10 minutes of ""press one......press two......"" i finally get there and get to listen to a recording saying ""we are sorry, the los angeles metro operator system is closed....""  sweeeet.so we got over it, gave up on taking the bus, and started walking back to a friends' house.  and of course, as we were walking away, the bus pulls up.  we wave it down, and it takes the bus driver at least a minute or two to even get the door open.  and by that time we had already committed to not going, so we watched the bus drive away and drunkenly stumbled back to the house.eff tha metro!btw!this was my 100th review!woooo!"

Unfortunately, riding the metro is more stressful, more expensive and less convenient. Not enough trains. Never on schedule. I dont recommend metro as an alternative to commute specially to your job. Hopefully the problem will be fixed, or else metro is a waste of time, money and energy. I am back riding my car to my job. Traffic is still bad but still much better than metro. LA metro FAIL"
224,3,"Nov 11, 2012","This is for mainly for 2 (Sunset Blvd), 4 (Santa Monica Blvd), 20 (Wilshire Blvd) lines which are the primary santa monica to downtown and everything in betweenLine 2 is the best. Quiet, scenic route, mostly latina housekeepers working in the westside and a few homeless beach bums. At least till you get to hollywood. All in all this is the quietest major bus line and is a pleasure to be on. It does run less than the others though, good luck catching an eastbound bus after 7 pm and a westbound bus after 9 pm...Line 4 is a mix of Latino workers who staff most of downtown santa monica and a huge number of homeless and druggies. Most of the UCLA/young professional types go on Big Blue Bus, so Line 4 is a little rough. Once you get to WeHo more gays and trannies come on. Plus some Silverlake alterative types. Late at night Line 4 is literally a homeless shelter on wheels. This is the most consistent owl service bus too, it keeps a 20 minute schedule even at 2 or 3 am.Line 20 along Wilshire is the worst. Far too overcrowded all the time. Wilshire Blvd passes through the densest parts of LA, and all kinds of people are on this bus. Workers, students, homeless, professionals, housekeepers. You'll have trouble getting a seat unless you get on the first couple stops.LA Public transport is not too good, but I'm OKAY with it because it's cheap and accessible,t hough highly unreliable.If you work a typical rush hour job (somewhere around 9-5) I would NOT rely on the bus. There are far too many inconsistencies with timing, seating, traffic, bizarre operator behavior where you can't expect to get to work on time unless you plan super early.If you are on a leisurely visit or have time to kill, the bus is a great way to get around, especially if you catch a Rapid (starts with 700) since they only go to major intersections.The majority of bus riders are homeless at night. They keep to themselves, but if you are disturbed by ranting and yelling, getting up and wandering around the bus, and awful smells, you might not like the bus.Also a lot of crack and meth addicts ride it during the day and talk to themselves.So ultimately if you have time to kill (or get to a stop way before you're supposed to) and don't mind hangin with the homeless 2 feet away with you the bus is a viable option. I'd only use it for leisurely experiences -. Too unreliable for work, even the worst traffic jam in a car is gonna beat the bus.EDIT: If you have a smartphone, get one of the apps like TransitLA or ""Where is my LA Metro Bus"" because they GPS track the buses. For the most part they have been accurate down to the minute (unless a bus driver effs up and ditches). If you have to be somewhere, you can pretty well rely on this tracker."

If you have the misfortune to beold, absent minded or just possibly preoccuppied and lose your TAP (fare) card-you are going to be in for a series of decents into Hades........untilyou LEARN what the rules are for replacing your card: and I dont meanjust getting a temporary replacement at either Union Station orla Brea and Wilshire.  That part is easy. It's what happens afterwards:FIRST, let me tell you that unlike CITI RIDE, TAP2GO DOES actuallyanwer their phones and they are open at 7am.  In general, the peoplewho work there, know what they are doing BUT they left out someKEY information: IF youlose your card and get a replacement, youhave to call CITI RIDE and let them know that the previous card,which perhaps you 'loaded' for a month or 6 months' worth ofrides is NO LONGER VALID! Don't expect them to make the necessary adjustments.   Second, IF YOU want to talk toCITI-RIDE you MUST CALL at 8:01 AM and be prepared towait-they are seriously UNDERSTAFFED and that is justfor starters. ANd dont try to get them for the first l4days of the month.  ONCE you have established that you will need a NEW CITI RIDE BUS CARD ,you must then realize that you haveto check with TAP2Go once CITI RIDE has mailed youthe card,to make sure that CITI RIDE loaded the CORRECT card. LEt'snot get started on the various errors that were made involvingmy replacement card, my old card (which was returned in themail-but since I had cancelled it when I bought a replacementcard, it was not good, etcetc)  It is something like navigatingthe rings of Hades to get it all straightened out-the one thingthat is good is that Tap2Go has email, so yu can at least voiceyour frustrations and get a response.   CITIRIDE is anothergovernment funded institution that has no respect for itscustomers and obviously recruits employees who have nounderstanding of what it is they are doing-whichI thoughtwas to serve the public, especially Seniors.  I have almostno hair left after my recent exerperiences, but at least I nowknow that the next card I lose (And it's inevitable), will be a sign that I should stop using public trasnportation and buy a car.It will be far less challenging."

On the con side are alot of the drivers have major tude,you have to deal with psychos getting on the bus/train,since most rails go by honor system you have to deal with sheriff checks from time to time. They board or are already on the train and they walk down the aisles asking to see your card and they scan it to see if you paid your fare. They always get someone for ridin dirty and it funny to see the rider put up a fight and say it was an accident or they forgot to TAP/pay the fare. Use Metro.net and you are set!

230,3,"Feb 6, 2013","gotta love the metro!  yes it smells, sux, and many times its dangerous,, but hey maybe you gotta brush up on your fighting skillsive taken the metro during 3-6 am in the am after clubbing, almost got jumped a few times, california should allow us to bring ninja swords or bow &arrows as bus riders, its crazy out therebig plus on that $5 day pass, with gas price goin up, it aint a bad deal.  plus you can be drunk while on bus, people will look at you funny but you wont get a dui ($10,000 fine)and you can take a nap in bus (bring your own pillow and plenty of sanitizer)"
231,5,"Mar 7, 2013","Metro ^_^I have been riding it since I was a baby because I cant afford a car haha. But its alm good because I have seen it all in metro buses and trains. I have so many stories to tell. But yeah, metro is the best way to get around and is full of surprises. I feel like I'm going on an adventure every time I ride a bus. Thank you Metro bus drivers for taking me here and there all my life hahaha. :)"
232,2,"Jun 2, 2012",although cheap the drivers need to learn to drive i've seen running red lights and speeding down streets(780) also this business of running once an hour after 8pm is just stupid METRO BUSES NEED TO RUN MORE FREQUENTLY AT NIGHT overall i'd rather walk everywhere than take the bus in los angeles
233,3,"Jul 13, 2012","I would say that I don't know why more people don't utilize the LA Metro system but prior to using it for the first time about a year and a half ago I never used it because I just never even thought about it. I'm usually traveling with other people and just always assume we're driving but last year I was attending a outdoor concert a few miles south east of downtown LA and when we realized it would be impossible and extremely expensive to park there we decided to take the Metro from another station past downtown. We drove and met up with our friends at their hotel by a station, each paid a low fee and road the train in from there. Very easy and not at all unpleasant. Much cheaper than driving, less stressful and honestly I think we saved time because we didn't sit in any of the bumper to bumper traffic waiting to park and what not. Exiting was a little more crowded but efficient. Like I said, I just never even thought about using the LA metro but now that I have I usually use it every opportunity that I can. Especially if you're going out with your friends and might be drinking so you don't can't drive...much cheaper than a taxi. Something we should all start using more often."
234,4,"Jul 27, 2007","Not sure if this is the correct listing for the entire LA Metro system as the address listed is in Chinatown but this seems to be the closest I'm going to get.  To those of you used to the public transport systems of NY, the two don't really compare.  LA is a huge city and not meant to be traversed on foot like NY is.   However, I do find it handy when traveling to places like Hollywood and Highland or to the Pantages. While I wish there were more Metro stops (i.e. along the Westside), they do have enough to enable me to take it about once or twice a week up to LA since I have a stop near my workplace.  One complaint that I do have is that they don't run as frequently as I would like them to, especially at night.  They've raised prices recently for the All-Day Pass, which used to be $3 but now is $5.  Each one-way is $1.25.  I don't suggest riding without a ticket, although they don't check most of the time.  However, when they do check, they often do it by the exits, esp. at the Hollywood/Vine and Hollywood/Highland stops.  It's a pretty steep fee if you're caught: $250 fine and I think 200 hours of community service.  And if you don't have proper ID with you, they'll handcuff you and take you to the station -- I've seen this happen plenty of times.  I've ridden it late at night, which I don't really recommend bc the trains are fairly empty, but nothing has happened to me....yet.  I definitely recommend taking the Metro when you have the chance!  It's saved me money and, once in a while, time - it's faster than driving through all that LA traffic."
235,1,"Jul 8, 2012","I've used public transportation in Los Angeles for about 6 years now and I'll still say it sucks. Yeah using it will save you gas money but then again trains/buses are so slow and for a trip that's usually 45 minutes by car it will take you 2 hours or more to get to your destination. To top it off, most bus drivers are so rude, especially if you're on the orange line. I've seen them shut the door on people so many times and they'll be right outside the door too.. I just don't see how they can be so rude. If it weren't for the people using the bus they wouldn't have their job so they should be more polite and professional. I've used the Blue Line, Red Line, and Green Line, and so far the Blue Line is the only one I'll say that's horrible. It's usually always dirty and smells bad. A lot of the seats are broken too. Last thing I'll mention is that there are times when you'll be on any Metro bus and out of nowhere in the middle of your bus ride the driver decides to take a break so you gotta be waiting for them and then your bus ride will continue. If anything they should take a break before or after the bus ride instead of making people late. With that said, I only give one start to LA Metro because it's gotten me to places but it doesn't deserve any more stars because it's service is horrible."
236,1,"Jul 31, 2009","Metro sucks. It takes forever for the buses and trains to come. Unless you live in downtown LA or Hollywood, it will take you a very long time to get around. Here's some advice: if you live LA, get a car. Simple. Yeah, the traffic and the parking sucks, but what's the alternative?"
237,4,"Aug 19, 2013","I am a teenager and I ride this bus everytime to go to school. This bus starts from Hollywood and Vine all the way to La Cienega and Jefferson Station. Sometimes, the 217 can go all the way down to Culver City Transit Center, which is around Centinela and Sepulveda. All the bus drivers I met are very nice, although traffic between Fairfax and Wilshire to Fairfax and Pico can be a bit iffy. I am still a big fan of line 217 and it is one of the best lines ever."
2,5,"Nov 10, 2023","CTA in Chicago is for the most part very reliable.It takes me from point A to B as well as C .Its waaaaaay better than driving especially in the downtown area.Many CTA bus and train routes run 24 hours.Just need to figure it out.You can put me anywhere in the city at any time of day or night and I can guarantee you CTA will get me to my destination.Sure,there is homeless people sleeping on the train at times.Sometimes CRAZY PEOPLE.But overall I know Chicago CTA is very beneficial and even critical to those of us who use it on a daily basis.Shout out to my bus and EL peeps!!! Aaaaaaand THANK YOU for always being there!!!"
3,4,"Jan 7, 2023","I refuse to compare the Chicago ""L"" to the New York City subway. I will not. To do that is literally comparing an apple to an orange and that simply is not fair.What I will do is praise the heck out of this system. It is clean, safe, reliable, and extensive. Those are my only similarities between the ""L"" and the subway. After that, things vary, and not just because most of the system is above ground, hence the ""L"" nickname.I found most people on the trains respectful. Not many panhandlers, and the rule about no bikes on the trains during peak hours is strictly enforced. I was on a train where a cyclist tried boarding with a bike and the motorman announced ""No bikes during rush hour."" To enforce this, the train would not move until the cyclist disembarked. That would never happen in New York City.Once you get the hang of it, navigating around the Loop is rather easy and fun. There are plenty of lines to pick from, and they all pretty much get you where you need to go downtown. Once they branch off the loop, some of the lines run express outside downtown, making it even easier to get around.From a railfans' perspective, it is an absolute delight. I found a parking garage that overlooks Tower 18 and you could easily spend several hours watching trains traverse this intersection. It is like watching vehicle traffic as trains stop to allow other trains to pass by or merge onto another track. Sometimes you can see up to four trains come together! It felt like a model train display being brought to life.I could also talk about METRA, but that is for another review."
4,1,"Oct 20, 2023",Reading these reviews I had to throw in my thoughts. I would say 90percent of CTA employees are rude and lazy. Ridiculous.  If you have a complaint call the station directly and ask for a Manager. (You can find the numbers by looking at the Lost and Found numbers on their website). To the person who said white neighborhoods get quicker service..no..all neighborhoods have terrible service..partially due to them being understaffed. And to the person in O.P. saying the homeless are along the tracks? You must mean outside the tracks. That's not CTA property. Sadly seeing homeless in big cities and nearby burbs comes with territory. I noticed you have another review complaining about the homeless..maybe a major urban area is not for you. Just sayin.​
5,4,"Mar 5, 2023","Coming from a big city with a shitty transit system, it's hard to judge CTA harshly. The only reason I'm on here is to express my pleasure with the staff working the morning of March 1 at the Merchandise Mart station. She was fan-f*cking-tastic! We couldn't figure out the machine and she didn't think twice about coming over and helping us. Then she shared a trick with the zip code for out of towners, and told us to not use our debit card while were in the city. Loved her and she kicked off what turned out to be a great day on the L.Dropped a star because waiting 20 minutes for a train feels weird coming from a city where a train comes every 2-5 minutes."
6,1,"Apr 13, 2023","CTA is just as racist as the rest of AMERIKKKA! Service is RIDICULOUS in the Black neighborhoods!White people in the more affluent communities don't have to wait 20 and 25 mins for a bus DURING RUSH HOUR! You charge like passengers get door to door service and most of the time you people don't clean the bus stops from snow and ice! You suck but at least you are consistent, you've always sucked! During this pandemic I haven't seen ONE power washer on the L platforms and then you have the nerve to say you are deep cleaning!And whoever  decided to change some stuff f these bus stops apparently never had to catch the bus on a regular basis in their lives! You shouldn't have to walk a half of a block to get to your connecting bus stop! CTA YOU REALLY REALLYSUCK!!!"
7,2,"Jul 14, 2023","Never ask any of the employees ANY TYPE OF QUESTIONS because their responses will be rude as hell. Just absolutely rude. I don't normally say I strongly dislike strangers but some of these employees are so rude and in the worst moments too, when you're struggling to find your way in the city they are not the folks to help you out and just will make you feel bad for not knowing the city and the transit system...this sounds mean but I've tried to be so nice for 5 plus years about the cta and i am about through"
8,2,"Mar 26, 2023",I don't even know where to start when it comes with my issue with CTA and that's my review
9,1,"Aug 27, 2023",Why say the bus will be here at certain time but never shows up? This always happens during Saturday or sundays for 81W. At least don't lie on your system that a bus will be coming when in reality you have to wait for the next upcoming bus instead..
10,1,"Aug 3, 2023","literally horrible, to be standing for 30 + minutes and yet say that your bus has departed when it hasn't? at the correct area for pickup as listed online too. Also, why do you guys have two separate areas for 81W to get picked up? online it shows I should be at one location but now this has me thinking you guys don't have your schedule together and the bus is at the other location ?? fix your s***"
11,1,"May 19, 2023","BAD. trains are NEVER, NEVER on time! What the hell? Constantly 30 min delays, doors close after 5 SECONDS. I would much rather ride new york transit and thats saying A LOT. whether i come extra early, or just on time for a train they are NEVER ON TIME. I have had to relocate my gd job because of this. RIDICULOUS AND SHIT TRANSPORT. youd be better off paying a local to piggy back you all the way to downtown."
12,1,"May 6, 2023","For commuters who rely on the trains outside of peak periods, avoid at all costs. Train arrival times are falsely advertised so that you pay the fare believing a train arrives in 5 minutes, only for that train to mysteriously disappear and have the next one arriving in 30 minutes. This also creates long waits at night in subway where crime frequently occurs. Because of this I will be relocating close to work to avoid any future reliance on the CTA. Use at your own risk!"
13,5,"Oct 25, 2021","This review is for the CTA BUS-Chicago Avenue LOST & FOUND..Have you ever left personal items on the CTA BUS and wondered how to find out if your ""lost items""  were in fact ""found""?I went on a Sunday Journey to Crate & Barrel to buy a few small culinary items.....then went to get groceries before taking the 72 Bus back home.It was in the afternoon and raining and only myself and another person were on the bus and we both got off at the same stop.Unfortunately, I forgot my Boxed Up Crate & Barrel Culinary Purchases on the seat directly behind the rear exit door.BUMMER!I got on-line to research how to see if there is a CTA BUS LOST AND FOUND.YES...YES...YES!The direct number is: (773) 638-3083Prompt #2 directly connects you to a ""human being!""I called immediately after I got home and the Lost and Found Attendant said to call back later as the bus driver/bus was probably still out on ""the job.""SO I WAITED and CALLED BACK THE NEXT DAY-Someone who said ""Lopez"" answered and listened to my inquiry on my Crate & Barrel Box ""Lost items"" and then checked and said that the box HAD NOT BEEN TURNED IN...aka the items were still ""LOST!""I thanked him and hoped that someone else was enjoying my condiment bowl,  4 appetizer plates, a festive pumpkin dish towel, and hanging Christmas Tree Cut Out.Lopez said that he would take my number and call if indeed it was turned in to the Lost and Found CTA BUS Department.  Very thoughtful and it is nice to actually know that people DO CARE...even about small things...THANK YOU CTA LOST AND FOUND!5 STARS for the Professionalism and Caring Spirit and for even having a Lost and Found that is staffed by ""real"" Chicagoans who try to help make the world a better place!"
16,1,"Jul 27, 2023","consistently late, having delays, and every train smell of smoke or over saturated with the homeless. So the people who pay to ride always get the short end"
17,2,"Jan 24, 2022","The CTA can do a better job at not succumbing to the mandates given by whom ever regarding the mask mandates. I have also been to the 79th train station recently and it looked as if the tracks hadn't been cleaned in months. So let's keep the tracks clean. Also, it's literally a snow day on 1/24/2022 and the Wallace bus normally sits at the stop for a few minutes and today they decided not to wait. They also did not take initiative to get the fallen crossing signs fixed by IDOT for the customers crossing from the other side of the street. There's a lot of room for improvement. Still grateful that he city has the public transportation we have, just gotta make sure we don't spend billions on one train stop (Washington and Wabash) and forget about everything else that needs to be taken care of.9:54am update: spoke to Randall in CTA customer service and seems as though he was bothered I had complaints about CTA. He ignored some things I mentioned and also interrupted me while in the middle of speaking. Also, the cover stickers on the glass windows  in the orange line halsted station need to be removed so customers can clearly see when the buses are arriving."
18,4,"Sep 26, 2021","Took the train from Midway airport to downtown Chicago. The station is a ground level station and on the Orange Line. There is indoor and sheltered bike parking available. This is also a bus stop. The $10 1-day CTA fare pass is affordable and you get to ride as many times as you want in a day. The ticket machines are easy to operate and if you take your time and follow the instructions it is not complicated. I had a little trouble with entering the terminal as I didn't see the sign change on the display on the turnstile. So I had to be let in by the agent. I'm a hot mess. The train was already waiting so we got on board. There are maps on the top so you can see the different stations and find the one you need. The ride was smooth for the most part and it was not crowded both times we rode. The train is on a platform downtown and it was strange to ride between buildings and be able to look into someone's room since we were so close. It feels like the buildings press against the train. When we got out, we made our way through the turnstile and down to the street. On the return, we found a station and took the stairs up and went through the turnstiles. There are elevators if you need. And the signage tells you which side of the platform you need to be on depending on your route. It's actually pretty easy compared to other train systems I've ridden on. They announce the stations where you can transfer to another line at so that's convenient."

23,2,"Dec 23, 2022","The CTA gets 2 stars instead of 1 because I find the 76 and brown lines relatively clean; I also appreciate the low fares. The scheduling, however, is completely unpredictable and unacceptable. The Ventra app provides up-to-date information on the arrival of buses/trains, but it's notably wrong the majority of the time. I understand traffic, weather, and personnel issues that affect transit times by a few minutes, however, about half the time the bus never shows. Today, this occurred while I was standing in -30 wind chill. The bus never arrived when ""due,"" and the app updated to show the next bus coming 15-20 minutes later. This is a repeatable occurrence. As an environmentalist, and as someone who believes in public transit, I wish CTA would just get it together. I'm not sure how anyone could depend on them for work transit."
24,2,"May 12, 2022","The bus drivers have gotten done right mean lately. I didn't get on 147 going north because it wasn't going to Howard it was only going to Devon. The next 147 after it was going to Howard. When I got on the female bus driver asked what was wrong with the first bus, as if I wasted her time picking up me. I told her it was only going to Devon. I always say thank you getting in and off bus. The bus drivers should snap at the customer who is rude not at people like me."

30,4,"Aug 19, 2021","Fast and often. CTA did a pretty job of getting us around the Windy City. Their multi-modal- they have trains and buses. You can use your Ventra card on all of them. I ended up caving and getting the Ventra app, which links up to your credit card, so you don't have to handle tickets and the machine being out of order. It's great once you get it set up. It took some practice to get down how to position my phone on the card reader. You use the phone to draft your account! The buses were swift, with lots of stops nearby. I was disappointed that many of the stations in the loop don't have wheelchair access. You gotta plan ahead if you have a wheelchair or something. The ADA wheelchair icon can be found on many, but not all the stations on the map. I got chewed out by one bus driver for not announcing getting off the bus fast enough. But that was on me. If you miss one bus, there's another one coming shortly, or another one nearby that'll come get you. It sure beats driving in this town."

32,4,"Sep 8, 2021","CTA exceeds my expectations.They're not perfect, but no transit system is.Here's what I like:Drivers and staff are friendly and helpful. They might be direct and talk loudly to be heard, but they are helping you with good intentions. I've had overwhelmingly great experiences with almost everyone.The system has a long history and the routes have worked themselves out mostly well. Things tend to run often.There's at least one rock band named after them. (Chicago, formerly Chicago Transit Authority, which was too long for rock and rollers, who were into the whole brevity thing)What I don't like:Random and unexplained delays, too often.Train cars aren't patrolled. People will beg for money, sometimes aggressively. Other situations might arise where you're on your own.In summary, quit driving and start bussing and training. Not training... L-ing, I mean.. Or uhh, take the train, that is!"
33,1,"May 2, 2022",The red line trains look more like a shelter for homeless people. And it's only getting worse over time
34,5,"Sep 24, 2021","I write this review to highlight the extraordinary service of three CTA train operators. Firstly I mention Barron of the Purple Line Express. His rides are experiences. I feel as though I am being transported on the Disneyland Monorail. The ride is smooth and precise, allowing me to enjoy the sights of Chicago. Barron is friendly and respectful. I have dubbed his run as ""The Barron Express."" Secondly I mention Cynthia of the Brown Line. The energy and cheer that she provides is out of this world. I think that she was born of another planet! Thirdly I mention Kevin of the Brown Line. He is a hunk who operates skillfully and kindly. I am grateful to these divine humans who take me where I need to go! Oh, and I love the CTA so muchly that I don a CTA hat in the wintertime (see picture). Thank you, CTA!"
35,1,"Dec 13, 2021","I was taking a friend from Florida all around the city and he was excited to ride the CTA and we bought a single ride pass which we is suppose to give you two transfers within two hours. Well every time we tried too use the transfers well within two hours it would not let us through saying it expired!!!!Plus we kept seeing smelly people sleeping all over the trains or people smoking several times or people rapping loudly a few times or yelling!Suddenly his excitement for the CTA and us riding it for 3 weeks went away as we could not count on it and it seemed silly to have to keep spending 3 dollars to get back on the trains and buses after only one hour especially when it claims you have two hours in which to use two transfers! And to do so with the sleeping, smoking, rapping, etc we kept encountering!On top of all of that there are always people bugging me for MY money and not taking no for an answer and people blaring their crap music.If the CTA is going to announce that things like talking on the phone, radio playing and smoking and demanding my money is not allowed then they need to enforce those rules!  As every single time I am on the CTA someone is on the phone being loud, playing music loud and always demanding I give them money and all the other things mentioned!Even now with new reduced fares which is great!  But due to all of the above I am not so anxious to take advantage of it sadly. The CTA like the rest of the city cannot control the endless bad pathetic behavior of so many in this city!"
36,3,"Mar 30, 2018","Omg it's raining CTAs and DGOs right now, it's making my dylsexia come out really dab!The CTA in general is okay. It's not quite as extensive as the New York System but it does work. There aren't really ways to get from one end of town to another in such a speedy way as the subway in New York City, and London also has a better subway system than anything on offer in Chicago. Having said that it's a lot better than some places. Los Angeles, Washington DC, I'm looking at you.Having said all that you have to say the elevated train is pretty amazing. But then so is your mother's body considering her age."
37,3,"Feb 17, 2020","For tourists, this is a passable way for getting around the city, especially if you are staying in the downtown Loop area. There are many stops that are close by all the famous attractions. However, for such a big city, I was surprised that the trains do not come more often. It was normal to wait at least 10 minutes for the next train. Also, there is a good amount of homeless people sleeping on the trains, with some cars smelling so bad, it was impossible to stay in them. Speaking of cleanliness, it did not appear that these trains are cleaned much, as the inside of most of them had plenty of wear and stains."

I was beyond pissed off! My grandpa is 60 years old and still managed to get to the stop with time to spare only to be disrespected like that with about 5 bags in each hand! I definitely reported the incident! Very disrespectful!!!

43,3,"Feb 6, 2019","The CTA and I have what I would call a love, hate relationship. When it's running smoothly and I happen to catch a good cart on the train, I'm the definition of a happy camper. Those days when everything is delayed and the cart smells so bad I almost get sick, I curse to the high heavens and dream of teleportation. I'm about to get really real here. You ready?Also, heads up. I must point out that the majority of my experience utilizing the CTA is with the train system, most particularly the Blue Line. While I've ridden other lines and the bus a number of times, I lived off the Blue Line for about three years and knew it pretty well. The upside - I love that the CTA has an app and that you can use to add value to your transit card while on the go. The machines they have at each stop are fine and fairly easy to use but using the app is the most convenient. The app will also tell you about arrivals, delays, etc. Their operators are real humans. They have bad days but they also good days, like the rest of us. If you're lucky you'll get a super friendly or even a singing operator. It always brightened my morning and I want to give that specific fella a shout out. I don't know if you're still there but you're awesome. The downside - Depending on the line you ride, the carts and the train itself can be outdated. The Blue Line specifically seems to be a really outdated. It always has less room and is visibly older than others, like the Red Line. The Blue Line is also one of the only 24-hour trains and while that may seem like a perk, be mindful of the time that you're riding it. You'll have folks keeping cover over night when the weather is bad or when they have no place else to go. Pro tip - If you're around during the holidays try and catch the holiday train. It's cute. Solid three stars CTA, thanks for your service."
44,1,"Jun 13, 2022",CTA is the worse run public transportation in the country!  It's loaded with homeless and drug addict's.  If taking to ORD in the morning hours it can take up to a hour to go three stops.  That doesn't include homeless jumping on the tracks to delay the trains.  Medical emergencies happen a few time a week which delay the passengers and ORD worker's to be late for flights and lose time from work!  This has been happening for at least 2 years! If you have to get to ORD take a UBER and save yourself a miserable trip

But determining what type of tickets to buy ... finding station entrances ... all challenging. I wish that the CVB and major events (like the Chicago Marathon) would include info for tourists about the system so you could easily learn how to take the train from the airport, major station locations, etc. The trains run 24/7 which is also a huge plus."

The amount of times they send a ""fake"" bus or train is extremely inconvenient for people who rely on public transportation to get to and from work. On the screen at the stop or online it will say train in 5 minutes or approaching, NO TRAIN arrives. This isn't just the early morning or late nights, it's consistently every day regardless of the time."
50,4,"Mar 8, 2018","I queried enough pedestrians as to locating the stop for the CTA60 bus to await it's arrival, nobody had a clue. Friendly as they were, how can there be such a disconnect between machine and man? So, the bus driver proceeds to inform me that he ""wazzint no toor guide"" and to step back from the yellow line. Fortunately for the overweight Martin Lawrence look alike, I use words for good -- not for evil.I was on the phone a second later with the CTA's customer care supervisor, bus ID number in hand. I'd love to use her actual name for her to receive true credit, but I'll not. She was apologetic and remedied my issue after two return calls totalling fifty well spent minutes.The buses themselves were in clean and quietly running condition. An atrium-ish effect, outside light was being send down and through the large windows upon the passengers. Each seat had contours dipping and curving suggesting a snug, well fitting squat -- and I must say that it works --- having had a fourty minute test ride."
53,2,"Jun 5, 2021","Love the ease of use getting from outskirts (Rosemont)  to downtown, but there is NEVER a presence of any CTA authority. Today a car so full of cigarette smoke we couldn't stand it, (same car had 3 nodding off or already passed out people) transients riding all day, people with no masks (required as of today) eating (not allowed), etc. Other large cities have these same issues, however they attempt to do something about it. Frustrating."
54,1,"Feb 24, 2022",The blue line is horrible you can leave out 2 hours early for work and you're still late you better be better getting a cab or a ride if you have a flight to catch cuz it's very undependable even on your way home you are sitting for hours lot of nasty stuff on here doing bowel movement on a train just a horrible option to go
55,4,"Sep 10, 2015","I don't have to take the CTA everyday.  I don't live in Chicago but then again I don't take the TTC everyday and I do live in Toronto.  Seeing so many negative things here about Ventra, the CTA and such all I can say is the citizens of Chicago that are customers of the CTA and Ventra... as bad as you think you have it be happy you don't have to rely on the TTC.I like the CTA and I'll tell you why:-The CTA is NOT the most expensive city transit to use in North America (Toronto is based on cost of passes, basically the foundation of your ridership)-The CTA doesn't get ripped off by fares in a sense of having an automatic payment system whether Ventra or Tap and Pay using your own bank/debit/credit card etc.-The CTA has 2 x 24 hours subway lines (red and blue)-The CTA has 2 airports served by CTA rail system (in Toronto we don't even have one TTC train service our main airport and the other airport is on an island)-The CTA has a wide rail coverage system over a vast area in 2 subway lines and 4 to 6 elevated lines depending on how you want to count the Brown/Purple/Red/Yellow extensions in the North.-The CTA has a lower ridership than Toronto but about double the quantity of rapid transit (subway/elevated train) stations than Toronto and can charge LESS to operate the system.My wife and I spent the last 5 days in Chicago and were either walking or using the CTA and over the entire 5 days because we bought 7 days passes it cost us a combined 56 dollars in CTA fares using Ventra.  This included a ride back and forth from O'Hare airport multiple bus rides all over, the L etc.  One cab ride from O'Hare to Magnificent Mile would have cost more than 56 dollars.  The CTA is convenient, easy to learn, easy to use and quick service while being affordable and feasible to use as opposed to taxis, Uber etc."
56,3,"Nov 28, 2016","The cta is ok because it gets you from one place to another.If you ask bus drivers questions sometimes they will treat you like a bald headed step child and give you a b.s. answer or be unfriendly.

Ah yes the joys of the city. Also don't ride the red line during a cubs game either way. You will find out real fast if the person next to you is wearing deodorant, aftershave, has drunk bad banaca.

Most people track the bus so they won't get killed while waiting for the bus. And a lot of people use it to get to work on time......"
58,1,"Jul 9, 2022","Covid can't be forever a blanket excuse. The #6 bus, notorious for being late, ghosting, etc, broke a new record today. Between 5:05pm and 6:15pm there wasn't a single bus. That's the bus closest to me, with other routes requiring I take multiple buses. There weren't any buses even appearing on the bus tracker until 6:15, and that one was listed as 28min away. I tried to catch the closest alternative to my destination but that one also had a 27min wait. I finally took the long route, via train and a connecting bus - and yes, that connecting bus was a 21min wait. When I boarded the bus, fully a third of the people were griping about how they had to take this alternative because the #6 never came. Damned shame. This is not just a complaint about a slow bus, this is an egregious slap in the face of south side travelers in the Hyde Park district. The #6 has an unsavory reputation for not showing, ghosting, and for afternoon (3-4pm), evening (8-9pm), nighttime and early morning ghosting. The bus schedules are on a fictional level with Tolkein. Every trip can't end or begin with having to take a taxi or uber because CTA plans stoppages during the day."
59,4,"Feb 16, 2018","Yes, there are some well-established complaints about CTA. But whenever I rode it, both the L and the buses, it got me right where I needed to go, quickly and without incident. I thought the service was pretty damn good; I was visiting for four days and didn't get in a car once. Visiting Europeans or residents of East Asia might beg to differ, and sure, it's not London or Paris or Hong Kong or Tokyo or Seoul. But the coverage, in and of itself, is pretty good. If you want truly world-class public transportation, your options are New York and D.C. For the rest of us, CTA gets the job done.I don't know how it was before, by the way, but the Ventra Card makes it a breeze."
60,1,"Oct 29, 2021","I thought maybe it was a fluke the first time, then it happened again..and again. The 54 Cicero bus is totally unreliable in the evenings. I'm not sure if early day service is affected the same? Earlier this year while the pandemic was still raging, a driver told me many drivers weren't reporting to work. Which left me waiting for two or three scheduled buses that didn't show up. AGAIN...just this past week (10/26?) I waited over an hour for a bus at Irving Park Rd and Cicero. Then when one finally showed up, the driver had no idea why the others were no shows. How can they not be aware of what is going on, on the routes they drive??? It was more tolerable during warm weather but how do you expect people to wait in the freezing cold like that!?? And what about people who are relying on this bus to get to work? There has been more than enough time to correct this problem."
61,4,"Jan 21, 2019","It's better than Metra.  At least the train conductors are decent humans. At least it's on time. The blue line runs 24 hours, so expect a good bit of  ""overnight sleepers"" if you take the the early trains. The passengers may be a bit unkempt and mentally imbalanced, so keep aware.  Chicago cops seem to neglect policing the CTA, so be prepared."
62,3,"Nov 18, 2020","please keep windows open for cross ventilation even if it's below freezing - a little discomfort will save us from the high risk of being in such closed quarters for a long time and let's face there's no adequate social distancing in a bus!  keep top part of windows and drivers should make sure they stay open.  many open the hatches on the ceiling of the bus on their own accord for some fresh air coming in - not all, but only some - all should do that as a minimum!  if you know of a driver please ask them to do so, it will help save their lives and those of others.that said,  my truest respect and thanks go to every bus driver being in a closed space for hours with many conscientious people and many more ""indifferent,"" ""lost"" and ""uncaring!""drivers, please keep the window to the left of your seat open some for you!"
65,4,"Jul 10, 2016","My 800th. review will be dedicated to an agency that provides mobility for me to ""yelp"" around the city: Chicago Transit Authority.  I've been using CTA religiously for the past three (3) years ever since I moved to Chicago from a small town America that everyone there owns at least two (2) cars, one (1) truck, and one (1) John Deer.  It felt so good to be back in a major city where I can do my thang without having to be vehicle-dependent.  Riding CTA isn't just to commute to/from work for me; it's my life style.  I put my $100 CTA/Pace monthly premium pass to work on my days off.  I ride busses and ""L"" to get to places.  I sometimes invite my hubby along with the ride.  Yes, I'm hangin"" out the passenger ride, of my bestie CTA's ride, but I'm hollering at no one...just wanting to enjoy my own solitude.  CTA and I's relationship isn't always peachy.  Often times waiting for busses or trains can be an excruciating experience, especially in the brutal winter season.  Yet what else can I do?  Bundle up, dress in layers, listen to some K-pop, and start dancing with it to keep my body temperature stable.  For the most part trains and busses are ""on-time.""  After all it's public transportation.  You always want to plan ahead, know the bus schedule somewhat, and familiarize yourself with the immediate surroundings (i.g. the closest place for bathroom, the nearest coffee shop, and the most convenient take-out restaurant for a quick bite).  Most bus drivers, train operators, and station employees seem nice and helpful.  Of course they have their ""moments,"" just like every other human being living the in the universe.  Nevertheless, safety is their number one priority.  Out of three (3) years riding every various CTA bus routes, there only has been one (1) accident (not really an accident....but the bus driver ran into something small).  Anyways, they've got my ""reliability"" vote.  Patronizing CTA is definitely not a luxurious experience, and this is certainly not everyone's cup of tea.  Some friends even asked if I ever felt like I would be getting shot.  Well, that wasn't that serious and I didn't want to engage such deep conversations with those friends.  Danger is everywhere, so keep your eyes wide open to be on the lookout.  Many of you will continue seeing me rocking with the CTA.  Oh it's time for me to check the bus schedule for my next CTA adventure."
66,5,"Sep 6, 2018","Rode the subways here for the first time a week ago on a trip. Overall not too bad. Trains popped up like every 5 minutes or so. Some cars are cleaner than others, but what do you expect? It's public transit after all. This system is my favorite after NYC. If you're flying into O'Hare or Midway, there are subway lines that will take you to downtown at cheap price. Best way to traveling in the Windy City."
67,4,"Sep 8, 2008","My brief experience with the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) reminded me of NYC's MTA in format, availability, and efficiency. The staff I interacted with were professional and got me where I needed to be.The CTA is convenient if you happen to live or work near a stop (if you don't have a car, they're kind of necessary). We took the Metro, via the Blue Line, both to and from O'Hare. While in town, we bussed from Navy Pier to a stop near our hotel. On the way home, I had to take a detour, ending up on a CTA shuttle for a bit. (Of course, when the CTA isn't available, one can always hail a taxi, especially if out late.)Besides being very confused with how to pay for their Metro cards (uh, don't ask), we got ourselves three-day passes, perfect for weekends and worth it for out-of-towners, especially since they can pay for rail AND bus service. Give them a try if you've never!"
68,3,"Oct 27, 2012","Magneto strikes (my wallet) again! My CTA Plus Card got demagnetized. For weeks I would play roulette getting on my bus (usually after all other riders) and the train, hoping my card would ""take"" after a few swipes on my pants leg (ancient bus driver's secret) or wool coat. The card finally failed, and so I easily deactivated it online.Once you deactivate, you can immediately pick up a new card! The CTA Sales Center is on the 2nd floor of their building on Lake, and there are a few computers right up there that you can access your account information, if you need. There are a few people working Customer Service who are nice, and the Sales Center is where you get your new card.They also have a Lost and Found for items lost on the CTA. (Wow, novel idea!) So if say, you find someone's wallet, take it here and let CTA handle it! I'm sure the person that lost it will appreciate your honesty, and will call CTA to retrieve it with all of its contents still intact.I'm sure service at the Sales center depends on whoever's working, similar to the DMV. My wait at 1:30pm was only 15 minutes and my time at the window picking up my new card took less than a minute. My new card was FREE. It happened so fast, I was wary that the lady had tied my new card to my monthly account, but she did! Easy Peasy! Don't hate! Appreciate!"

Before heading to the train platform at O'Hare, we purchased a 7-day Ventra Pass for $28. For unlimited rides on the L and buses, it is an awesome deal! Though a new card costs $5, it is also a memento for the trip (like my Pasmo card from Tokyo)! I imagine that I will just load up the card again on my next trip to Chicago! The train cars for the system are well maintained and really clean (can't say that about BART)! It is awesome that CTA can get you all around town in a fairly quick and economical way.

80,1,"Aug 30, 2020","Very disappointed in the ""Chicago Transit Authority"". In a time when their services are needed drastically . This morning August 30, 2020 at a approximately 9:43 a.m. the 53 bus (8132) on Pulaski going south bound passed me right by as I stood with 2 other potential passengers. I am 61 and disabled and one of the other people was on a walker. This is the main reason why I am complaining. We all stood on Van Buren and Pulaski. High crime, high drug invested area. Murders have increased over the last few months in this area. Nonetheless, this driver cruised right by us like it was nothing. I could not believe my eyes. There were literally 7-10 passengers on this bus. I chased the bus to Congress and Pulaski a block away,  and this driver looked me dead in my eyes embarrassingly with a gesture (IM FULL). I was livid to say the least and the people standing on the Pulaski Blue line L station saw it all. With the many corono virus scams this over weight bus driver came to work to drive up and down the street and collect a pay check. Not aware of the many dangers he had left us in. Since the CTA have cameras for crimes. Roll your video back. My time is pretty accurate. To help you even more. The following bus stopped for us all. Bus #53 (4103) @10:03 a.m. This bus was full beyond capacity. Because of the latter bus this driver was pressured and under stress. However, this bus driver was respectful and took his time to accommodate the public. Roll the video back on everything I type. As I said my times, dates, etc. are pretty accurate.  Once again to the consumer. In these times we do not have to riot and loot to express ourselves. You can be right but after committing a crime no one will listen. This bus drivers behavior is unprofessional, lazy, callous, and inconsiderate. When we witness and experience these things we must tell someone. Thank you for reading have a great day."
81,2,"Jul 17, 2019","Oh where to start. They haven't figured out rush hour despite decades of experience. Trains will be ""delayed"" then stacked one after another. Randomly they'll go express and usually past your destination. The experience on the train can be a nightmare, especially on the red or blue lines. And don't ask for help at any of the stations, those attendants would rather you not bother them with your ""questions"" or ""do their job"". They do stay open during the winter which is why they get two stars. At least they're consistently subpar regardless of snow and ice."
82,5,"Aug 31, 2017","I've lived and/or spent time in other major cities in the US, CTA has been mostly great during the 10+ yrs I've lived in Chicago. I imagine it's somewhat elaborate to operate a public transit system. Two 24 hour rail lines that cover N/S/E/W orientation, decent bus service, & Ventra app to manage both CTA & Metra cards are pretty solid. It's also pretty reliable no matter what the weather is like. Awesome additions a few years ago with bus timing via ctabustracker.com & station digital signage. Loop Link is great, too.Obviously it's not perfect - when the buses breaks down, someone urinates on the seat, or there is a street person asking for money - but I guess that is part of the experience. Rush hour bike restrictions are also lame.I couldn't really thrive here if I had to drive everywhere due to cost, yay CTA for $2.25 single ride travel and logical station/stop locations."
83,4,"May 28, 2014","The Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) is largely an effective system.  I've have only ridden the rails, or ""the El,"" given that the Orange Line is one of the train lines that actually circulates on that elevated ring, or loop, around downtown Chicago which has most of the stops one will need if visiting the Windy City. I don't believe all of their dedicated heavy rail lines travel on this archaic structure, which feels really funky and slow when it's elevated in that ""canyon"" between major buildings in the center of the city.  The Ventra $10 day pass is useful.  It is an easy way to travel in the service zone and cheaper and less cumbersome than buying separate passages.Both O'Hare and Midway airport trains come into the city via traditional subway type cars.  It seems like the system is well thought out, with different nodes at which various lines come together, bus service splices in, and connections to other commuter rail options to the northern suburbs or areas to the south, as far as suburbs in Indiana, are available.  Most of it seems to be above ground but, in the center, the Red Line does function as a subway for at least part of the way and runs parallel to and west of famed Michigan Avenue and its Magnificent Mile.I'm deducting a star because the trains aren't the cleanest, there are some sketchy types on board (damn, that's judgmental), and parts of the infrastructure are old.  There are periodic service interruptions to address this.  I got nabbed in such an interruption.  On the Orange Line from Midway, the track between two important stations, Halsted and Roosevelt, was closed for work.  For a trek that should take about 4 or 5 minutes on the train, the ""bus bridge,"" with its waits on both ends, took about 20 minutes.  Then, if you think the track infrastructure is old, check out the dated stations in the Loop, which look like something put together at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution.  Regardless, they have their charm.When you first board a CTA train, the first thing that hits you over the head is how multiethnic, diverse, and crusty Chicago is.  Yet, despite that, there are NO bilingual announcements.  How would that even be feasible?  So many different people from different places around the globe live there that it would point to some sort of ""favoritism.""  For that lack of bilingual announcements, I'd almost give them that star back.  Sorry, but that's just a pet peeve of mine.  But, hey, at 4 stars, neither they nor I should complain."
84,3,"Jun 27, 2017","This is coming from a tourist from Des Moines that doesn't deal with public transportation, especially on this scale.If visiting is using the CTA an efficient way to get around town? Yes. For the most part I would say yes. We stayed out by the airport so by utilizing the park and ride we were able to travel to both Wrigley Field and downtown, using the L and buses. On the multiple rides we took we never really had issues with delays.Is the CTA clean? Clean is a relative term. Most of the trains themselves seemed clean on the inside. Some of the stations on the other hand were downright dingy and stinky. I'm not a germophobe but there were surfaces on both the train and at the stations that I refused to touch.Is the CTA safe? It's public transportation in the third largest city in the US. Safety can sometimes be a gamble. I would say that if you are riding during the day or during peak times like before/after a Cubs game gets out, you will probably be safe. I'm not sure I would ride it after sundown but that's just Iowa me talking. You will see your fair share of homeless people and beggars at time. For the most part I can deal with that. Luckily in our visits we've never once ran into any type of criminal activity."
85,4,"Jul 8, 2014","It's kind of hard to rate Chicago's transit system right after visiting NYC.  This is probably the 2nd best mass transit in the country.  But I do have some complaints.  First off, their new Ventra concept is awesome.  One of those smart tap credit cards.  Genius! However, it does cost you $5 per card.  But I guess that technology does not come cheap.If you're a visitor for more than a couple of days go with one of the unlimited packages.  You will totally use the value and then some.We had the weekly unlimited pass even though we were there for 4 days.  After the 2nd day we had used up the price and then on the way back to the airport instead of a cab ride we paid for the original cost of the cards.As far as the transit system if you stick to the trains (color lines), it's spectacular, but when you start using their bus system, is when you want to start pulling your hair out.The color lines run pretty consistent and are fast.  The buses on the other hand are hit or miss.  Certain buses by the end of the trip I noticed were more on time.  While other more specialized buses, I guess, would often miss there time window not once or twice and end up arriving after the 3rd schedule pick up.  Other times the bus drivers would just look at you and keep on driving.  By the end of the trip I had decided no more buses and just walk to the nearest line and take that and walk some more because the buses were so unreliable even if it provided a ""shorter route""."
86,3,"Aug 8, 2011","It was my first experience with the CTA, so I guess it set the standard for all subsequent trips.  It was ok, a bit ghetto but takes me north and south every 7 mins. I can't complain."
87,1,"Dec 20, 2016","Born and raised in Chicago, and the bus drivers for the 80 bus are the worst!!! I have one driver I get quite often and is rude on so many levels! Not only does he harass the customers, he started on me because I spoke up. When he gets on after his break  at Central, he passively aggressively asks the driver that he is switching with, if I gave him problems... Then stares at me the whole time in his rear view mirror. Dude is gonna get his ass dragged off that bus and beat one day!!"
90,5,"Mar 24, 2016","Writing this review as a lowly tourist from Atlanta who's spent most of her adult life riding our podunk-ass MARTA:So I was in Chicago for about 5 days and got a week-long pass because 1) I stayed in a place that was two blocks from a stop and 2) I knew I'd be doing a shit ton of touristy things like going to a ton of museums, galleries, jazz clubs (Green Mill, holla), hipster bars and barcades, etc. So the convenience alone of being able to zip from one place to another was a Godsend. I mean, I could get from my AirBnB and be at Stan's Donuts in Wicker Park in like 20 minutes or so- that's WITH a transfer from a green line to a blue line. There were some delays occassionally, but hell, that's life, so I wasn't too fussed about them. Yeah it was pretty cold and that sucked, but they have heating stations, y'all. HEATING STATIONS. Let me tell something about petty-ass MARTA in Atlanta. One winter's night when I was waiting for a bus at one of the train stations that happens to have a little heating station - two workers there were warming themselves up, I waited til they left so I could get me some of that good warm heat. So they proceeded to turn that shit off as soon as they were done using it. Bastids. Anyways, heating stations throughout the fall-winter are a major plus AND they're always on? WHAT? Let's see, even the busses - when I had to take one - weren't too bad. They were mostly clean, usually timely, some of the little bus shelters have the upcoming times scrolling on a screen. WOW! You can even text a special number with the route that you're waiting for and some magic machine will text you the upcoming times - friggin amazing!What else, the trains, busses, stations were mostly clean, especially within the loop. The people, well you see all kinds of people on public transpo. So I guess if you're like scared by ""sketchy"" looking people - don't go to Chicago...just kidding - take Uber or rent a car.The workers there when I needed help getting somewhere were quite helpful also. Don't be scared to ask most of them know the lines like the back of their hand. The only thing that CAN be kind of confusing is all the different lines, but I'm coming from a place with literally only two goddamn lines so maybe I was overwhelmed. And I'm not going to lie; I did get lost a lot. But, definitely if you're staying in/near the loop, get you a pass for however many days and enjoy the convenience of CTA."
91,2,"Jul 4, 2014","Don't get me wrong, the blue line is great.  I can't complain too much about the service because it keeps me from having to own a car.  I appreciate that it runs 24 hours to and from the airport, that's where the issue comes.The trains on this line are overly used and it is starting to show.  The archaic seating arrangement isn't very conducive to all the bags being brought on from O'Hare.  After seeing the newer train cars on other lines I was shocked that the blue line didn't get them first.The seats on the train we got on last night were horribly dirty/stained.  Hope the blue line gets new cars soon!"
92,4,"Aug 25, 2016","Took CTA on 8/24/16, this was my first visit to Chicago so I was constantly looking for comparisons between NYC transit authority and Chicago's.      First I must mention cleanliness. I took the train from O'Hare to Monroe station and did not see any liter on neither train nor station. Thumbs up to both residents and the transit authority for doing such a magnificent job at caring for your environment.      Also navigation was pretty straight forward I was able to look up directions using my iPhone days before my trip. Upon arrival to the airport I was able to  follow the signs to the transit station. I also bought my Ventura pass needing no assistance as the machines were pretty straight forward.    I was swiping in incorrectly and transit workers nearby quickly showed me to place it over the yellow area and I was on my way. Considering I was traveling at peek rush hour I was shocked that there  were no delays. Overall Chicago's transit system is light years ahead of NY as we are now getting the digitally time updates of when the busses will be arriving: anyways I found the CTA system to be efficient and I'm happy I utilized it. This was the cheapest option to get from the airport to my downtown destination."
93,1,"Sep 24, 2018","Ignorant, rude drivers who look like you are bothering them for doing their jobs. Guests from out of town reported this plus confusing bus stop signs during weekend service. Waited hours for a bus that would never arrive. #130 does not run on Sunday? No bus driver they asked from any route could tell them how to get from Union to museum campus. So, they UBER'd it. Even costed less than bus fare. What a waste of tax dollars."
94,1,"May 15, 2019",I was waiting at the bus stop and the CTA bus drove right past me! I'm extremely annoyed right now!
95,5,"Mar 13, 2017","Five stars on Yelp means ""as good as it gets,"" and Chicago's public transit is, by far, as good as public transit gets--at least, as far as I can tell. Compared to Boston, Philadelphia, Washington, Houston, New York... Chicago knows what it's doing!Rail service is frequent and almost rarely delayed due to traffic. Well, maybe there are slight delays here and there, but I wouldn't know because I leave early every day anyway, and I'm pretty sure traffic is built into the scheduling.CTA is pretty responsive on Twitter and it's actually cool to check out the feed. They share interesting stuff. Even better, though, is that people complain sometimes to the CTA and the CTA staff are experts at tactfully shutting down people who make mountains out of molehills.I refuse to permit the denizens of the train system to impact a rating on its reliability, but I must acknowledge the reality. Sometimes the trains really do smell like pee. Sometimes there are people who reek of urine sleeping on the train. Sometimes people who reek of urine ride the overnight trains so they can sleep on the train. That's... reality. And it's also a human services issue, not a public transportation issue. Maybe if there were sufficient social services so people facing homelessness or already are homeless had places to go where they were treated with dignity, the trains wouldn't smell like pee.Then again, I take the red line, and one lesson has been learned: the same bros who complain about the homeless passengers do a great job puking and pissing on the train, too."
96,1,"Sep 1, 2016","The CTA has been around for 69 years and still is as unpredictable and unreliable now was it probably was in 1947.  Scratch that, in 1947 there probably was more accountability on drivers, analysts, and managers to make sure buses run on time.Poor children, parents with children, elderly, and disabled people who have to stand through painfully brutal winters because the CTA likes to play ""spot the 3 buses coming at once"" then no bus for 20 minutes.Seriously, if you want to travel back in time, jump on one of these time machines.The truly sad part is that everybody is suffering in silence when these buses/trains run ridiculously inefficiently, because, for the most part, Chicagoans/Midwesterners are polite people and there really is no place to actively share grievances.Just like what Uber and Lyft did to the taxicab industry, the CTA's fate will eventually come to a happy end when innovative privatization comes along with some better because people demand better."
97,1,"Jun 8, 2018",The Ventra Card debacle!  The cta has its own problems but now they have a for profit company that we pay a premium to - in increased rates - that adds to the CTA's problems.Ventra sent us a faulty card.  The ventra operator on the phone (since it's a school card) could not issue us a new card.  Instead we have to reapply for a new card ourselves and pay another fee for the new card.  Then we can call in and they will credit the new card with the old defective card remaining balance.What a pain and super stupid and inefficient process.  This is what happens when you sell off government services people - it doesn't get any better only more expensive.  AND you now pay a premium because you've got shareholders who need a return.Ugh!  CTA - what else can Chicago sell off to profiteers at the expense of it's citizens?!?!?!
98,4,"Feb 23, 2012","Probably on the best public transporation systems. I was using CTA for a couple of years when I was in Chicago.Few of the facts about CTA--The monthly pass just costs $86 and single ride is $2.25 with a transfer just costing 25 cents and second transfer is free (Transfer should be done within 2 hours of start of journey)--They have a CTA tracker application where one can track the buses. It is really awesome and is accurate 95% of the time.One can also get the update to date information on schedule by sending a text message.--Awesome connectivity to trains connecting suburbs.They have link up pass which just costs $45 and one can use it on CTA and PACE buses to travel to union station to catch the Metra Trains. There is nothing like link up pass in NYC which makes one buy different passes (LIRR, Subway,PATH etc).-- The stations on almost all the CTA lines are super clean and very well maintained unlike the subway stations on MTA in NYC.Though I adore CTA but there have been times when it has annoyed me. The most annoying thing which I observed  was that multiple buses arrive at the same time. That just does not make any sense because the other two buses will go almost empty. Many a times there have been unannounced delays in CTA trains specially in the blue line while going towards Ohare."
99,4,"Feb 17, 2012",One of the train rides which connects the loop to Pilsen neighbourhood. The best thing about pink line is that it is never as crowded as red and blue line. I used to take it from the stop at the randolph/wabash to travel to Little Italy village close to UIC campus. Though there are buses from loop to the village but I always felt the train ride was much faster and comfortable. The train does get slow when it enters the loop and unlike blue and red line it does not run 24 hours.
100,4,"Oct 2, 2012","Damn CTA, your transit runs all over the place, is easy to use and has buses and subways.  I've never been to the office but the buses and subways are pretty damn awesome.  Thanks for taking me all over Chicago for cheap!!!  They also have an great website that you can plan trips with that will map your bus and subway route. That helped me get across the city with ease. They also have a phone app! Thanks for making public transit easy CTA.Thanks to the subway I didn't even have to put up with your damn taxi's honking ALL THE DAMN TIME!  What's up with that by the way?"
103,1,"Jul 13, 2008","This is like shooting fish in a barrel, but I'm going to do it anyway.First, two stories:1.  A few weeks ago, on a Sunday night, I went to the Randolph station to catch a northbound Brown Line.  I just missed a train, so I decided to time the next one.  The station timetable claims an arrival every ""7-10 minutes"" at that day/time, at which I laughed out loud.  I said, ""Ha!  Forget seven, I'll even give you the ten.  I bet twelve to fifteen.""  Not even close.  TWENTY-SEVEN MINUTES!  I could have rowed Washington across the Delaware in less time.2.  Today I was walking up Clark Street, just crossing Lawrence, when I saw THREE southbound #22 buses pulling up to the stop.  Three, right in a row!  Not within a minute, but literally each behind the other.  I know that ""bunching"" is no news to anybody, but I don't take buses (it's a long story, but I'm committed to it) so I had never seen it in action.I've lived here a long time but the recent funding ""crisis"" caused me distill my years of frustration with the CTA, in my own mind.  My main objection to the CTA is the mismanagement.  Poor operation that manifests itself in a million little ways across the system can only be the product of bad leadership, right at the top.  They spent months begging the legislature for money, sending emails to customers and posting notices asking us to write our congresspersons.  Meanwhile, half the stations in the system are undergoing renovation while riders are inconvenienced every day, plus a few years ago they built an entire new train line!  What the hell are they doing throwing money away like this?  Have you heard of responsible budgeting, CTA?  Fiscal planning?  COMMON SENSE?They need to focus their priorities on the basics--keeping the trains, buses, and stations clean and making the routes run on time.  Clean and on-time is all we want!  CLEAN AND ON-TIME!I could rant on, but nobody wants to read that.  CTA--get your act together."
104,1,"Oct 27, 2011","IT GETS WORSE!!Can I review something with NO stars, or negative stars? Because that's what the CTA customer service gets. I had to completely strip down and start over. Pay these robber criminals $5 for a new Chicago Plus Card and wait 10 days for them to get around to sending it to me. Really, CTA. If you were a person, you'd be a degenerate felon criminal. You have no scuples and are not helpful in the LEAST. You just take money for NO service. NO help and with no remorse. Another thing: My CTA card IS NOT A CREDIT CARD. Do NOT add funds with out MY PERMISSION. Damn.The CTA needs to be wiped clean and get a do over. Shameful that a large metropolitan area has a transit system that is so broken. How are the people that work here even employed?"
105,1,"Oct 24, 2011","This review is for the CTA's CUSTOMER SERVICE.Possibly the worst I have ever experienced. Lobotomized monkeys on the other end of the line spouting the CTA party line. My ""unlimited"" CTA Card Plus gets screwed up every month, and switches to a Pay As You Go, so I get extra charges. Unacceptable. It's enough of a pain in the ass to use transit exclusively at times, can the customer service reps actually be HELPFUL and solve a problem once in awhile?Real morons. They need a clean sweep of this organization and then hire people who actually have functioning brains. Shocking and shameful. And highly frustrating."
106,5,"Jan 22, 2006","I love public transit so much, I actually sold my car."
107,4,"Dec 30, 2009","THIS JUST IN:I bought ice cleats for the winter so all you dumbasses who insist on positioning yourselves in slalom formation on the trains and buses had better watch your piggies.Cos I've got cleats. Sharp metal cleats.IN OTHER NEWS:The entire CTA bus fleet is now GPS-enabled and on the Bus Tracker system. For those of us without fancy web browsing iDunnos, there's a handy new text message feature. (This, while New York's MTA has finally abandoned its failed attempt to implement a similar service.)Sure, the buses tend to be erratic and clump, but I'm growing more convinced that that is largely caused by ignorant, inconsiderate riders who won't buck up and follow a few simple rules:- when the bus pulls up, fucking board it; why shuffle over like you've got a turd halfway out your ass?- have your damned money/card ready as you board; most likely there are people behind you and the bus will not leave until everyone is on- while you're waiting for the bus/behind a malingerer, get your damned money/card ready- move to the rear of the bus as instructed by the big red stickers and the recording of the nice man with the nice Midwestern accent; due to layoffs caused by the economic recession, the CTA will no longer offer complimentary ass-wiping at the entrance- exit at the rear; no one can get on when you exit at the ENTRANCE- don't get all haughty when I tell you you're a dumbass for exiting at the entranceIf we estimate that people who pull these dumbass moves delay a bus by 15 - 30 seconds at every stop, think about how much time that adds to every trip.AND ON THE TRAIN:Similar rules apply. It's even easier than crying into your bottle of BooHoo! I'm not lying. Cross my heart and hope to brand your piggies with my cleats. Truth!I feel that things seem to be going quite well right now. The station agents seem more pleasant, the trains seem to run regularly. The people who complain about piss and vomit like it's a daily occurrence must have severely bad karma. Or maybe they're habitual complainers. Hmm, let's ponder that possibility. The last time I saw vomit on the train was in 1996, and I ride the trains and buses a lot, all over the city, at all times. And even then, I was disgusted by the puke, not at the CTA. Duh!IN CLOSING:The CTA is far from perfect but it really does the job if you can button your pants and shut the hell up. In my dreams, the system would work like the ones in Tokyo, Singapore, Paris and a handful of other cities (but still maintain 24-hour service, of course). If that is to become a reality, we need to do our part. The authorities have a lot of work to do but we certainly shouldn't make it harder for them.Now get out of my way. Cos I've got cleats."
108,4,"Jan 17, 2009","I've given this some thought and think there's been a misunderstanding.THE CTA IS A PUBLIC TRANSIT SYSTEM, NOT PERSONAL DAYCARE FOR A BUNCH OF OVER-ENTITLED CRYBABIES.Of course there are going to be delays and breakdowns in service if people don't learn to ride responsibly. Here are some simple tips. Feel free to share:- hustle when the train/bus pulls in, don't amble over like you're getting popcorn during commercial break- when you board the train, KEEP MOVING IN as far as possible; don't stop to take in the view- if you're by the door, step off to let others out; this eliminates the irrational fear of riders getting stuck in the car and missing a stop and, therefore, the unwillingness to move towards the centre of the car in the first place- if you're waiting to board, wait till others have exited; only salmon should work so hard against an oncoming deluge- your groceries, backpack, laptops and miscellaneous bullshit didn't pay a fare so they are not entitled to their own seat- SIT DOWN if there's an empty seat so others can move in; you're not a hero for standing that extra stop or two- resist the urge to chat with the bus driver and MOVE DOWN THE BUS- exit buses at the rear whenever possible so you don't impede rapid boarding at the ENTRANCE; there are stickers and announcements requesting you do this so there's no excuse for you not to do so, unless you're deaf and blind as well as stupid- speak up if you witness dumbassedness; crying into your Pinot Grigio after the fact helps absolutely no one- keep your boring cellphone/live conversations to yourselves, and turn your cheesy music down (well, none of these disrupts service but I just want to point out that you're neither interesting, special nor important)I used to get frustrated at the CTA for their seeming incompetence, but when I really thought hard about it, a large part of the problem fell squarely on the empty heads of many who use the system. You can throw all the money and planning you want into the CTA and they will still fail if people insist on working against them. There's no way the CTA can overcome millions of lazy, ignorant dumbasses coming at them each day. Simply none.Don't even try comparing the CTA to mass transit systems in other cities. Well, if you do, first use them and take note of how much more civic-minded their riders are. Even in New York, whose residents are much maligned for being 'assholes', you will note that people generally approach public transit as a PUBLIC SERVICE, meaning no one gets special treatment unless they actually need it. No one on the MTA will put up with any of the shit that happens on the CTA. If that makes them assholes, it also makes you a dumbass crybaby.No doubt, the system is far from perfect. I think we all know that. But if we truly want the CTA to improve and succeed, we have to do our part. Yes, whining to your friends is easier and probably more fun, but it doesn't get the job done.One more thing: KEEP YOUR DAMNED HOOVES OFF THE SEATS. That's just fucked up."
109,4,"Apr 7, 2012","Disclaimer:  I was only in town for 5 days, in a sub-let in Wicker Park.  That said, I *love* the CTA!  We used the Blue Line to get from O'Hare to Wicker Park, and from Division to the Loop.  We used the Red Line to get to opening day at Wrigley, and took the Brown Line back to the Loop.  We took various buses to the Museum of Science and Industry and to the Field Museum.  We traveled early to mid-morning, and typically came home during rush hour.  With all that, the longest we ever waited for a ride was 8 minutes after having just missed the #6 bus from Science & Industry.  The rush hour crowds were no worse than anywhere else, and significantly better than in my native NYC.The only down side, IMHO, was insufficient explanation regarding the difference between CTA and Pace services - at O'Hare, anyway... so we wound up paying for services (Pace) we didn't need.  I think some simple signage by the vending machine would set that right.  Oh, and without Pace, it's only $23 for unlimited rides over 7 days ($28 with Pace).  Kudos to the CTA!"
110,4,"Oct 24, 2015","After reviewing my Ventra card activity after our 5 day stay in the Windy City, we tallied 32 bus rides and 8 L rides total. Without any major issues on our travels using CTA, I can say that I am a fan. We got full value out of the $28 7-day pass Ventra card. If you don't want to mess around with the refunded $5 card fee when you purchase at a machine, you can go to the ventra website prior to your trip and they will mail your card to you without the $5 charge. I would go to the Ventra website anyway if you're unfamiliar with the system. There is plenty of helpful information and videos which will probably answer any questions you may have.We didn't spend a dime on a rental car, cab, or UBER. We never worried about things like taking a wrong turn or getting lost. We didn't have to drive around in circles to find parking nor did we have to follow anyone to their parking spot. We were never late. And we didn't pay one parking fee, especially the bend-you-over hotel overnight parking fee.From our Magnificent Mile hotel location to any of our destinations, we never had to make more than one transfer and we never had to walk more than two or three blocks. Google Maps was an invaluable tool that I used to get from point A to B that never let us down. We were able to find exact departure and arrival times, stop locations, and bus/train numbers using the app.Yes, it is public transportation so there are some unsanitary areas. You're sure to find some homeless and just general Shady McGradys hanging out. I was always aware of my surroundings and I never felt threatened or in danger.I'll have no problem using CTA on my next trip to Chicago and the hundreds I save will be used for a nice dinner or to upgrade to a hotel in a more convenient location."
111,3,"Apr 26, 2010","The buses are a/c'd and pretty fast, decently on time. nothing to really complain about. I think for the most part the buses arrive on time, they do remind me of MTA in NYC but for some reason New York just does it better. The CTA is probably the cheapest way to get around town in Chicago, especially if you're a tourist which reminds me I need to go download some maps so I can plan my next trip out accordingly. It's definitely not as good as other public transports I've experienced but it's efficient along the lakefront areas and sufficient for where I want to go. At $23 or $28 for a full 7-day unlimited use, this is probably the best way to go which saves a great amount of bus fare for one trip. Good for traveling while on business when you don't want to deal with the incredible parking fees around Chicago."
112,5,"Nov 20, 2016","You know' it's just like they say, you don't know what you got until it's gone!Best, and I mean THE BEST, transportation system (public) that I have ever experienced!$100 unlimited per month, buh bye car payments, gas and maintenance.. And parking!With a medley of trains, and busses that Ho almost anywhere in Chicago, seriously the best at to go. Personally, I prefer busses, more likelihood it's not packed and you can sit, unlike trains. These all do suck in winter though, and those lightbulbs heat no one! They just make everyone huddle like sardines!I miss it. I miss the grid system for busses... Other places don't have that. Enjoy it while you live there!"
113,4,"Jun 13, 2013","The few times I've ridden the CTA I've been thoroughly impressed.  The trains (speaking for the blue & red lines) are pretty clean, the announcements are easy to hear & understand.  They even tell you what side of the train the doors open on... how fantastic is that. The signage used throughout is easy to read and clear to follow.  And they've got some super friendly employees working in their booths.  Many thanks to both who pointed me in the right direction.Bonus points for the CTA buses.  Each bus stop had a scrolling schedule to let passengers know when the next bus was coming.  As a NYC resident who doesn't have this... I thought it was awesome."
114,1,"Dec 29, 2017",There are not words to describe my disgust for this company.  Especially the bus system. It is so ridiculously bad at providing service i am better off walking the majority of the time. I try to use the tracker for buses but a crystal ball is more accurate at telling when a bus arrives.  The only thing the tracker is good for is telling you when to watch the bus leaving you behind because it got there before you could.  I wish i could never ever use their service again.
115,3,"Dec 26, 2016","I am on the 151 Sheridan. I ride this bus and the 22 from Clark to Michigan. There are some very courteous bus drivers who greet folks and say goodbye. We then have today's fellow who doesn't seem to understand with the sun glaring right in your eyes (or if a customer was visually impaired) that we need a short lecture on how to swipe our card. It is one of those petty power type of conversations that can be maddening when dealing with City employees. Bus drivers, as all people, must be aware that not everyone has the same eyesight, dexterity and other human conditions as does everyone else. Yet, I applaud the many kind and considerate bus drivers I encounter on a frequent basis!"
118,1,"Apr 12, 2016","Me & my grandmother bought two 7 day bus passes at Walgreens for our vacation in Chicago. We tried to scan them when boarding the first bus. One of the cards worked, and one of them said ""Insufficient fare."" We had just paid $66 dollars for both cards that morning. One of the bus drivers was about to make us pay bus fare in cash when we had a faulty card! We headed back to Walgreens and exchanged it for another. On a different note, I was right near a bus ( transit # 1693 ) and it was the bus that I needed. I made eye contact with a driver and practically stood in front of the bus but the driver wouldn't stop for me. DO NOT RECCOMEND THE CTA!!!"
119,4,"Apr 5, 2016","Went in to get my Free Military service ventra pass, process was rather quick.  There was no one in the line (Monday at 10am) and paperwork/taking pictures/new card probably took 15 mins total.  Customer agent was very courteous, no complains there. I rarely ride CTAs but at least now I can use my own card instead of bumming off someone else's hard earned money!"
120,3,"Sep 9, 2005","The motto of the CTA is ""Take it"", so I do. I have been around the world and have been spoiled by excellent public transportation systems in other countries. The CTA is pretty efficient along the lakefront mainly because of numerous bus routes. Otherwise the service is mediocre at best for the rest of the city."
121,4,"Nov 23, 2008","For all its faults, and there are many, the CTA rocks. I don't know how I would survive in a city that didn't have a public transportation system. Really, I am an impatient person and if I had to drive everywhere and fight for parking regularly I'd probably be in jail for road rage. So thanks CTA for keeping me on the right side of the law. I've been riding the CTA my whole life, way back before the days of the fare cards, Chicago Cards and those now defunct tokens. I remember the days of A & B trains and the conductor announcing each stop, which sounded like someone screaming into a mic with a mouth full of rocks. All I can say is kudos for all of the improvements, it's definitely made things more efficient and rider friendly! I know people know people are frequently dogging the CTA, but seriously people, like John B, most of my complaints are with the riders. Use some common courtesy once in a while! Here are some tips: * Say excuse me, don't just push by people* If the bus is filling up, put your crap on your lap* Don't clog the front of the bus or stand under the back sensor so the door inevitably jams and the driver has to come fix it* If the bus or L is crowded and there's an empty seat you're standing in front of take it; I don't care if you get off at the next stop, it creates room. Or move so someone else can.* Get up for the pregnant, elderly and handicapped* Tourists and infrequent riders do a little up front research, we all hate when you stand in the doorway playing 20 questions with the driver while we all wait.My 2 favorite things about the CTA? Chicago Card and Bus Tracker. Seriously, like other Yelpers have said the #11 has become my new BFF since getting added to bus tracker, and thanks for doing it just before winter too!  Now please go and get the other routes I ride on bus tracker - double time!Bottom line: Despite some of its faults and sometimes smelly buses or trains the CTA is great. TIP: If you lose/break your Chicago Card, or if it blows out of your hand and gets run over by a train, you can order one online for pick-up or delivery OR you can go to the CTA office in the West Loop and get a new one on the spot.TIP: This trip planner works way better than the Google one http://tripsweb.rtachicago.com/"
122,3,"Nov 1, 2013","There are positives here. The train services both the major airports of Chicago, and runs reasonably fast to the heart of the city and services a wide variety of other areas. It's ridiculously cheap. It's one fare to go anywhere in the system, unless you get on at the airport which costs twice as much (but still not a whole lot). The one employee I interacted with at length had no clue about places to eat near the station where she worked (odd), but was at least friendly enough to help with a few things.The downsides are that the trains are dirty, crowded, and look like they're from the '60s. It's a confusing system and it seemed I wasn't the only one who needed help understanding the ticketing, the gates, and the stops. Their machines don't give change. Many stops are not handicap accessible (and also a challenge for anyone with luggage). It seems like a broken down old system in need of major overhaul.As compared to public transit in my hometown (DC), there were two key advantages. One: nothing broke down while I was there. Two, at least they're not gouging on fares."
123,3,"Sep 17, 2008","For all of the talk about how much financial trouble the CTA is in, I expected their Customer Service Center on Lake Street to be in some dank basement .  And based on the level of service I'd heard about, I had the mental picture of it being in a dungeon with apparatus for torturing those poor souls who need customer service from one of Chicago's least popular abbreviation agencies.If function followed form, the customer service center should be a beautiful experience.  The second story of CTA Headquarters in the west loop is an airy, open space, and well climate controlled.  The glass and steel design makes it seem like it would be space aged and fast.  Kind of an anti-Secretary of State's office.In general customer service there was this potential pleasant experience.  The Customer Service desk knew exactly what to do to replace an expired Chicago Plus card I had for which the replacement had got lost in the mail.  The purchasing clerk who I saw first, on the other hand, seemed have no idea where my card was or what my desire was (that I wanted to pick up a new card and have the one lost in the mail cancelled).What was odd about splitting my transaction was that the customer service clerk seemed to have more information about my transit card than the purchasing clerk.  The guy working Customer Service gave me a number on a post-it-note and told me exactly what to say to Purchasing.  When I said these words, a glimmer of recognition crossed the face of purchasing and the transaction was done in two minutes.  Why CTA has customer service and purchasing done by two separate people I'm not sure (I though they administered a lot of redundant administration).  I'm glad they weren't together, however, or my experience with purchasing would have rated a pure one star (when I came back on Monday to find no replacement card).  Customer service seemed like more of an ombudsman than anything.  Just a recommendation: unless you know exactly what to ask, see customer service first and not second.All that being said, for cut-and-dry situations, purchasing has four windows running at lunch and the lines went incredibly quickly.If everyone was cross-trained in the service area at CTA headquarters, the overall experience would match the sleek design of the offices."
124,1,"Jan 23, 2007","Crain's Chicago Business and Time Out both just published broad editorials ripping CTA up one side and down the other.  Why?  Anyone who has ridden mass transit in another country will be disappointed.  That's why I was disappointed on arriving in Chicago and witnessing the dilapidated state CTA is in.  That was in 1996.  And I was comparing it to Japan and Korea, where you don't need a car in any major city because you can take mass transit anywhere.  And it's always clean and always on time.  You can practically set your watch even by bus service in those countries.  It's hard to put into words how malnourished mass transit is here, especially after the recent alleged ongoing ""improvements"".  CTA is suffering from decades of neglect.  Chicago taxpayers are missing out on so much more than they know."
125,1,"Sep 10, 2018","One star for getting to most of the important places you'd want to be in the city.Minus four stars for overpriced poor service. Like, really really poor service. And I've lived in six major cities, CTA drivers and schedules /late buses / lack of planning (why are the stops always in the wrong location?!) is by far the worst. And they're one of the most expensive. Don't eve get me started on Ventra. Horrible."
126,4,"Sep 28, 2017","Taking the L in Chicago was a breeze.  I knew we would take the train into the city from O'Hare but in all honesty I didn't do much research, other than knowing our hotel was near a stop on the Loop.  Signage was great!  We were easily and quickly able to find the train at the airport.  The ticket kiosks were also very simple to use.  I bought a 3-day unlimited pass for $20.  The train ride into town was about 40 minutes.  It's a little tough with luggage, but very doable.  The train obviously got more congested as we made our way downtown.  Train cars were decent.  Similar to MUNI in SF.  Maps were visible and easy to read.  We later took the train up to Wrigley Field and then back to the airport.  It made our trip pretty flawless and cheap!"
127,4,"Apr 22, 2015","***I really enjoy riding the CTA because it connects the city so well; it is easy to hope on it and get to all kinds of attractions and restaurants in a consistent time; this stations lets out to popular Chicago restaurants like Avec, Blackbird, Grace, and Sepia***I am not sure what the parking situation is in this area; this station is on the edge of downtown so maybe parking is not that expensive around here."
130,1,"Apr 9, 2018",Was thrown off the bus because ventra card was reading not sufficient fare. My card automatically reloads each month a worked on train but not on the bus and you never go through to the customer support when you call.
131,1,"Jul 20, 2018","The CTA is horrible! I ride the Metra from the South Suburbs to downtown (which is pretty good), then ride the Pink Line between Washington/Wabash and 18th St. I swear...every single day there are a number of delays. The longest delays seem to occur during the evening rush hour.I guess, if you have never traveled to developed nations, having limited experience with only America's public transportation, this norm may not be THAT bad. However, as someone whom has traveled to more than 20 countries, the CTA (along with the majority of public railing in the country) is absolutely atrocious. As anecdotes, while visiting Australia, Europe, and much of Asia-I was thoroughly impressed with how their subways and elevated rail cars operated like clockwork...arriving on schedule to the exact minute. While the Metra is comparable to other developed nations, every single day I wonder, ""why, in the hell won't the CTA (and America) consult with other nations in order to learn the correct methods for operating public transportation?"" I've been to Third World nations with more timely and reliable rail service than the CTA."
132,1,"Apr 4, 2015","I HATE CTA!! I'm waiting on the 115 and one pulls up, I get on and pay. Then a lady gets on and says is this the 111 or 115? The driver says 111 and I say it says 115 - the driver says oh sorry. REALLY CTA, are you that broke that you have to charge people twice? Your drivers are lazy and no NOTHING ABOUT CUSTOMER SERVICE!! CTA SUCKS!!!!"

135,3,"Jan 15, 2016","I never take buses, so I won't talk about them but I always take the train like I've been doing most of my life. Only common concerns are driving to get to Midway and being at a train stop during congested hours primarily. I refuse to drive because of the photo red light/speed traps (scams)... The day I will give CTA 5 stars is when they have no budget crises or any Chicago problems in general not related to CTA and extend the Orange line to Ford City or Further, along with a circle line or adding more stops to help the needs of others in need of transportation."

I guarantee you that you would be saving your own self from being a Violent Crime victim. People say that the Howard red line is very bad, i rather be in the Red Line than the Austin Green Line through the West Side. If you take the green line it can take you Through the South Side as Well even Very Bad Areas Like Washington Park, Fuller Park, and Englewood DO NOT TAKE THE RED LINE ESPECIALLY AT NIGHT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
137,4,"Sep 30, 2010","Before moving to St. Louis, I would've given the CTA two or three stars.  Many a cold January morning did I stand on the sidewalk waiting for my bus, only to see FOUR 22s or 36s all bunched together in a convoy, each bus unable to escape from the pack.  Which bus will stop for you and which will blow past you?  Which bus is jammed with people and which is nearly empty?  Which bus will win in the weekly North-South Leapfrog Contest and get you downtown the fastest?This isn't nearly the extent of the problems with the buses, and I won't even address the trains here.  But for all the CTA's quirks, its rude passengers and gruff drivers, and its downright maddening qualities, it is a comparatively well-run, efficient, cheap, reliable, and convenient method of transportation.Occasionally, one experiences per se awful or excellent service and Yelps about it, but by and large, reviews are written and stars are given to an establishment based on its relative performance to like establishments.  I compare the CTA to the St. Louis and DC Metros.  Based on the operation of those two outfits, without reviewing them here, I can confidently give the CTA four stars."
138,2,"Apr 25, 2018","I love Chicago and was looking forward to playing tour guide to some friends from FL who decided to spend the week there. I wanted all to go smoothly and researched which train stops had elevators in order to avoid 2 60+ year olds and a millenial female from having to carry heavy luggage up or down stairs. The trip began to sour almost immediately because the elevator at the Roosevelt station was out of order. OK, things happen. We needed to switch to the red line and had to go outside in the cold around a building to another elevator dragging all the bags with us. That was when I became embarrassed for the City and for myself because I am always bragging about Chicago. The elevator smelled like a sewer and the liquid on the floor of it was something you do not want to step in or stand your suitcases in. Fortunately, someone was kind enough to open the gate to the train for us so that we did not have to pay again and we boarded the red line. Going to O'Hare for 7AM return flight yesterday, the elevator at Clark and Lake was just being locked. The man said it was ""not acting right.""  I had no time to waste and so I asked him to let me take one more ride (willing to take my chances), but when the elevator went down, the door would only open 7 inches and could not be forced open (would have been nice if he had told me that was the problem), so I wasted time going back up and finding the escalator. Thank goodness that was working because sometimes it is not. SO DEAREST CHICAGO:  Elevators in train stations are CRUCIAL. It is already a shame that they are not in every station, but $$$$ MUST be spent to make sure they NEVER break down. Elevator function needs to be checked and fixed on every one during the night so they are not malfunctioning at rush hour. This is not just for seniors with luggage, but parents with strollers and people in wheelchairs needing to get to work. These elevators look like they have done their time, they move at a snail's pace and need to be replaced. And providing a public restroom with BIG signs to them in the station may deter people from urinating in the elevators. That is a health hazard and an embarrassment to the City of Chicago."
139,3,"Feb 2, 2011","Cleaner on average than New York's MTAReliable, short cars on the rail so stand in the center of the platform.For such a cold city they need those heat sections on the platforms. Beware the pigeons may act like they need the heat more than you do.How can I forget their transfer policy that makes me occasionally get annoyed with New York. The price is 2.25 like New York, but you can go from a train to another train or a bus within 2 hours and only have to pay .25 cents. How great is that? I want them to do this in New York."
140,1,"Feb 25, 2018","Pathetic.  Took my $20 for a $5 ride and wouldn't give change.  Total rip offObviously designed to generate mucho revenue ay expense of passengers.  What a screw job.

143,4,"Oct 15, 2005","They are not perfect by any means. I need to use them once in a while and am very grateful. When I was in between vehicles a couple years ago, I took CTA all the time. Considering the price of gas and the fact that you could go all the way from the end of Evanston to the South side of Chgo for 2 bucks makes you realize we have one of the best public transit systems in the country. If you don't like waiting too long for buses, call them or get a route schedule; they are usually not off by much. It will help alot, especially in winter."
144,5,"Dec 15, 2011","CTA and I are friends...Yeah, I said it.At first, I thought that we should to be friends because I like getting in my car and having a 10 minute commute to work or 20 minute commute to church. However, with parking, insurance, and towing in the winter, I knew I had to become friends with CTA this summer. And I did. I have been too/ lived in a few major cities and Chicago was made for CTA. I mean, I really only have to pay $90 a month to get around anywhere and anytime. I love that I can text to know when the next bus is coming. I love the heaters on the train's stops in the winter. I like that CTA expanded its Zip Car efforts. I like the Chicago Plus card. I also like how CTA has made sure it's connected to the Metro and South Shore line. My family and I appreciate this. You can learn the city by learning your way around the Red Line. Ok, so improvements for CTA would be having cleaner cars for the trains, have police/security ride the trains for peddle handlers (esp. now during the holidays), and heat at every train stop (what about Brown-Kedzie!) I think adding more bus shelters with the marquee would be helpful they have in Hyde Park. Other than that, it IS public transportation. Keep that in mind, we better be grateful Chicago has invested in a public trans system as large and outreached as CTA is, as other large cities are still trying to figure out how to get to our level. I've seen and experienced much worst. No worries about gas, insurance, parking, towing...the list goes on; I like it! CTA is a life saver and I will sure miss it when I leave Chi-town. CTA and I are friends."
145,1,"Oct 8, 2014","It's been a long time coming, but I finally remembered to review the gruesome, inefficient, Chicago Transit Authority Corporation. The services provided by the CTA truly epitomize the essence of incompetence. From the rampant crime in almost every station, to the recurring smell of urine in almost every station, there isn't anything remotely enjoyable about riding the CTA except for the occasional El ride with an empty car and a nice view. Unfortunately, most of us city dwellers are forced to ride it, because who wants to pay for parking or a cab every single day?! I sure as hell do not. Ventra has been a nightmare; I am routinely charged extra by the machines, and despite writing complaints, I am never refunded. Further, the trains are consistently overcrowded with uneven run times, making the commutes last longer. Efficiency is not the CTA's strong suit. Also, who remembers the moron who fell asleep at the wheel and crashed a train into the O'Hare escalator!?There is really nothing good to say about the CTA. It's a shame so many of us are so reliant on it. It's like the airlines or cable companies - we hate them, but we are forced to use them! Damn monopolies... The dysfunctional inner workings illustrate even further how the government should not run companies like this. Public trans, unlike our parking meters, should absolutely be contracted out!"
146,1,"Feb 3, 2020","Ventra has literally the shittiest service possible I really cannot believe how awful they are. So much money lost, so unbelievably inconvenient and they don't care because obviously we still need to take the shitty train. Please take me back to paying cash I'd rather that over Ventra's crap."
147,1,"Mar 30, 2018",The worst service ever they're always late and never stop when u are there and even laugh looking at u sarcastic always delay and then arrive together to the same direction and is so frustrating is the worst service i ever had! But when do u charge on-line they even take double the payment! What kind of service they think are giving!
148,1,"Dec 7, 2017","74 EB comes whenever it wants, the drivers are completely ignorant of time or schedule then want to beep at everyone and purposely miss stops because they're running late. No wonder rideshare use is going up."
149,3,"Mar 17, 2015","I'm a big fan of trains, and when I'm in Chicago I appreciate that I can always take the El/Subway from either major airport to and from my usual destinations. Fares have remained low. (I now live in the San Francisco area, where commuter train fares are charged by distance, and most rides are quite expensive by comparison to Chicago.) While CTA doesn't necessarily run according to its timetable, it has so many routes and they run so often that most of the time (other than late at night), there is rarely too much of a delay. The buses and trains are pretty clean compared to many years ago. I am not a fan of the new Ventra fare system where you have to pay an initial $5 deposit plus your fare, and then go online to get the $5 back. Pain in the @$$. (I may not have this quite right; it was quite difficult to figure out, and I'm a tech professional.)"
150,3,"Jan 11, 2010","As tourists this was a huge money saver, than having to hail money guzzling cabs.  Another plus for 24hour service and a line that goes from Ohare airport.  Funny thing is if I were touring the bay area I would be pretty darn pissed because I would be limited to the BART and turtle buses.  Anywhos this system is well laid out to dropping us off at nearby tourist targets.  I had the 3 day pass; it worked wonders for the bus and subway.  I kind of wished the interior stank of fresh flowers and the ride was somewhat faster.  Not up to par with new york's system, but better than having nothing like it in the bay area.  Kudos for CTA bus tracker.  My buddy had it on her iphone and we knew exactly when the bus would arrive."
151,1,"Jul 8, 2019",I ordered a vintage CTA map cell phone case.  I paid for the case but never received it.  Emails to CTA gifts go unanswered.  The phone rings and no one picks up.  DO NOT ORDER ANYTHING ON LINE FROM THEM!

155,1,"Oct 26, 2019",This is the most unprofessional company I have ever come across. If you are visiting please beware. I had to take the 63rd green line on a Saturday morning. From 35th to Roosevelt a shuttle bus would be provided.. ok I guess. The made everyone on the 4/5 car train pack onto one bus that didn't pull off once the train occupants were all on but proceeded to wait... ok cool I guess. So once we finally get there (Roosevelt) they made everyone wait in line to get back onto the train as if we were all criminals trying to sneak on for free... but the icing on the cake is they didn't even have the decency to have a green line train waiting on standby nope I stood there for an additional 10+ minutes before I had to hop on a completely different train to get close to my destination so that I wouldn't be late even though I made sure to add an extra hour to my commute to try to accommodate for this reroute. Then when you ask the CTA employee basic questions they all act clueless as if your bothering them! I will never do this crap again. I would rather pay an UBER $20  before I deal with this crap
156,4,"Sep 2, 2014","After spending three days on the CTA, I'm impressed. Yes, it's a little slow and it's old. Could it use updates? Sure. However, it functions getting people out and around the city. I commuted in from the Rosemont station. My favorite line is the Brown Line. I rode the Brown, Red and the Blue Lines. The Red Line is definitely a lot grittier than the other lines. Unlike New York, the line wasn't completely congested with panhandlers, but you definitely had to be aware of your surroundings. It did get very crowded at times, but it was easy to navigate. Plus you can't beat the view from the Brown Line. I'd ride it again just for that view. So take it for what it is. Well used, filled with ""interesting characters"", easy to navigate, with a few hidden gems along the way. Tip - avoid the lines and buy your Ventra pass anywhere but the station."
157,4,"Nov 13, 2008","To say I was born on the CTA is an exaggeration. To say I rode the CTA before I was able to walk is not.Rating the CTA is almost impossible for me. It's like an aging relative -- sometimes it has good days, sometimes it has bad days. Are the good days good enough to make up for the bad days? For me, yes.It's unfortunate that the CTA is a victim of our corrupt political system. No one in power is really vested in fixing the CTA. Its perpetual budget crisis is due in part to mismanagement from within, but primarily from the fact that politicians have more to gain from a transit system that is at least partially broken -- and which they can use to feed voters on both sides -- than one that works smoothly. Oh jeez, here I am on that soapbox again.There are things to hate about the CTA. The 22 Clark bus is a mystery. It runs on whatever schedule it likes, and has done so for at least 15 years. The construction crews, which always seem to consist of at least twice as many men necessary to do the job, are a constant annoyance. But the CTA allows me to live in Chicago without a car, and is one of the things that has kept me here so long.You know what I hate most about the CTA? People. And by ""people,"" I don't mean CTA employees, despite the occasional rude driver. I mean the fuckwads who ride the system. The people who won't move to the back of the bus, or who stand in the exit door when there's plenty of room, or who spread themselves out over several seats. This is the latest development -- people who don't there stuff on the seat next to them, but the seat in front of them. WTF! Unfortunately, we live in a world of jerks, and there's nothing the CTA can do about that. Which is why I feel free to chew these idiots out whenever possible."
158,4,"Sep 10, 2011","The CTA covers a wide area including downtown (the Loop, Magnificent Mile), O'Hare Airport, Midway Airport, Chinatown, Lincoln Park, etc. It's affordable ($2.25 per ride), easy to use and with clear signs. The trains for most lines seem to come frequently (I've never had to wait a long time) and the stops aren't too far apart. They have express trains (skips stops) during peak hours. There aren't many escalators, so be prepared to climb stairs. Platforms in the downtown area are popular with street performers. When you're on the train, each stop is announced. There are also system maps inside each car.It's hard to find a 1 day pass at times. You have to go to Rite Aid, CVS or a similar store (but not Walgreens) and currency exchange shops to get the 1 day pass and they tend to sell out. It would be convenient to be able to buy it at the O'Hare stop, but that's not an option."
159,1,"Dec 28, 2011","Whoever says that going carless is awesome is fucking lying. You LIE. This isn't the first time I've had to rely on mass transit. In high school I'd commute to school using the max and Trimet in Portland. Nowadays when I can, I'd rather just walk it or if it's late I'll cab it. I find that when I'm on the CTA, I often times think of evil mean thoughts. *ugh take a shower! Nasty ass. Shouldn't you be potty trained by now? I am and I know some 2 year olds that are, stank bitch. Ew stop eating on the train you savage, I don't wanna smell that! Must you drink that stank beer on here right now? You're not even in cubs gear. Get your own money you money grubbing whore, I worked hard for this shit. Get away from me you weirdo or I'm ready to Lysol spray your face. Blow your fuckin nose BITCH. Tissue is 1.39 walgreen's. Fuck*  Atleast in my very own car I can avoid homeless people asking every single person on the train if they can spare some change then leaving a putrid strong odor of rotten piss mixed with death for everyone's enjoyment. The joys of urine soiled clothes! Gulp. Good gawd its strong and I've encountered this lady a couple times now on the green and red line. Get the fuck out of my face. Gaaaah..!  The hyena on the red line that sings out loud and off tune like a mentally ill cat and hyena hybrid in heat to Britney spears songs. STFU. Even my iPod at full blast couldn't tune this shit out. He/she gets on the redline at the grand or chicago stop. That's not soo bad though compared to...Person eating noodles in a black garbage bag with their bare hands and slurping loudly. I had to put my iPod volume on a little higher and look somewhere else thinking happy thoughts. The smell, the sounds, the sight made me nauseous.The monologues of why they deserve your spare change is ok because I can usually tune it out with my iPod. Then I close my eyes and think of a happy place.Besides the colorful and inconsiderate passengers you have to share your ride with ( hello bigger riders that plop down beside me and sit spread eagle... Squishing me. While sneezing without covering your damn mouth. Seriously?) I also can barely stand the incompetence of the CTA. Late/early arrivals, delays, taking forever to get places that shouldn't take that long to get to, etc.. I felt like I could get so much more done driving myself. I feel that the best way to cope with my temporary ridership of the CTA is to play it like I'm dead inside. Become a zombie robot waiting and riding the CTA, then back to lively me once I get off. Zombie robot.. Lively lively!.... Zombie robot... Zombie robot.... Lively lively... Zombie robot....Lively lively!Driving and owning a car is a luxury and believe me, it's worth every penny. It's not that hard to avoid getting parking tickets or towed. It's called reading signs. Look into that. I'm doing it again SOON and I'd rather sit in traffic anyday. Besides, if you're an efficient driver, it's not that hard.Remember: play dead on the inside if you have to rely on the CTA. And Lysol spray-doubles as a weapon and air freshner. Good Gawd."
160,3,"Feb 7, 2008","I don't really know how I feel about the Pink Line. I take it everyday from work, and it certainly is a great route for those in the Pilsen area to get in and out of the Loop. However, I don't think this thing could go any slower once it actually does get into the Loop. The Pink Line is like all the other lines' doofy little brother. Or that friend that every group has who is alright to hang out with in bits, but once he starts coming around all the time everyone's like, ""Whoa man, Pink Line is starting to bug me. Maybe we should stop letting him know when we go out. Last night, after he got a few beers in him, he was going on and on about how he had a dece makeout with Gina and I was all like 'Alright dude, I get it.' Seriously, I missed the Counting Crow's whole set because of it."" What I mean is, the Pink Line is at the very bottom of the order when it comes to the other lines. It has to stop and wait for everything. You can never get a straight shot on that thing. There are always a ton of stops and that stupid ""waiting for signal clearance"" announcement. Sometimes they'll let 2 or 3 Orange Line trains go before they will switch the tracks. No joke. Plus, when you're waiting for it, you'll see repeats of all the other lines pass before Pinky finally decides to come rolling through. Does no one care about the Pink Line? It could be nice if it got some respect, like Rodney Dangerfield."
161,4,"Jul 5, 2010","This review is an example of how speaking up actually solves problems. Even on the CTA!So, those who know me know that I am a creature of habit. I get up at the same time every day, leave at the same time every day, etc. I like being on a schedule. Schedules are fun.Suddenly the CTA started to mess with that schedule. I was leaving my apartment at the same time, but the express bus that I normally caught to work simply stopped coming. I tracked it on the bus tracker, and sure enough - it just disappeared. The next express bus came 10 minutes later, but then I would end up being a few minutes late to work... and I HATE HATE HATE being late, even if no one else cares.One morning I decided to email the CTA and ask them why they got rid of this bus run, thus putting about 30 minutes between two express buses in the morning.Here's the key - I didn't email them and act super bitchy like I'm sure a million people do. I simply asked a question, gave them the information from the bus schedule on their site so they would know exactly which bus I was talking about, and I even took a screen shot of the bus tracker so they could see that there was a bus missing.The NEXT MORNING... as in, less than 24 hours after I sent my email, they had a supervisor at my usual bus stop. He asked a few of us waiting if we were waiting for that specific bus, and we all said yes. We all told him it hasn't been coming for a few weeks, and at first he was sarcastic with us... until he saw we were right. Oooh, burn, CTA man!A few hours later the CTA emailed me, letting me know that I was correct (don't you love hearing that?), there was a problem with that run and the supervisors were on it.It took a couple days, but now that run is back to it's regular schedule, and so am I. It comes like clockwork every day when it's supposed to, and this makes me happy.So folks, if you have a problem with the CTA, here's my advice - as frustrating as it can be, know that no system is perfect. Don't give them attitude, just contact them with as much factual information as you can. It seems like they actually do care and when they are given proper info, they will do their best to fix it.Now, let's just hope this review doesn't jinx my bus..."
162,1,"Dec 11, 2013","It gets you where you need to go, but holy hell do you ever pay for it, from rude bus drivers to stalled out trains, this mode of transportation is the pits. I swear that the bus drivers actually try to knock  you over by pushing down on the gas as soon as you swipe your oh so classy ventra payment card, way before you have a chance to even look for a handrail, it must be some kind of game. The schedule is totally theoretical, not something you can rely upon, it's kind of like being in Colorado and using a map of Kentucky to find your way around. For people who are poor and/or are trying to be environmentally conscious, you sure feel like you are being punished if you subscribe to the hellish conditions of the cta. Every morning I get on the train, it smells as if it has been raining urine, I believe there is a hidden sprinkler system that sprays piss all over the seats and floors right after the ""end of the line"" announcement is given. To transfer at the Washington train platform, you have to pay, the others are free, why? Because the urine sprinkler system is disabled and you have a chance to browse the dozens of merchandise carts that sell iPhone cases. When I travel on the cta, I truly hate myself and every decision I have ever made, you will too, join the city of Chicago in hating yourself, where you come from and where you are going. Just remind yourself that you only have you wait another 8 hours before you get to use it again."
163,4,"Apr 30, 2009","Though I can for sure say that this isn't the absolute greatest transit in the world (Europe's got way more on us), I'm a huge, huge fan of the Chicago Transit Authority.  I have been prompted to update my review after visiting their newly updated website (www.transitchicago.com) and being pleasantly surprised.  I really love the format!  It's very user friendly and very informative.  I was on the website to try and find more information about bike racks at my local blue line station and everything I needed to know was there!!  There were maps of stations, routes and specific information about the kind of bike racks located at my blue line station.  That's exactly what I wanted to know!The blue line is still great (albeit under construction to do some much needed repair/replacement of tracks) and runs quickly during the rush periods.  I love the buses in this city, too.  We really have one of the best and most extensive bus systems in this country.  Have you ever been to New York?  They have like three buses and it's super annoying (sure, they have way more trains, but still).  Detroit has that one bus that sucks and who knows what is happening in L.A., but it ain't pretty.  We really take our transit system for granted and I don't really know why.  No other cities have the same kind of bus system as Chicago so suck it up and quit your complaining.  And just as a note, I'm as angry as you about fare hikes.  It seems like they continually raise fares and don't really do anything.  A lot of the money needs to go to the Brown Line overhaul because it costs way more than they ever estimated.  I wish this wasn't the case, but I'll deal.  I love our trains and buses because they get me from point A to point B quickly.  Have you ever used the bus tracker?  It's awesome!"
164,4,"Sep 12, 2008","CTA is convenient and necessary.  Aside from the occasional problems with late-ness, there's really nothing wrong with CTA.  Our trains go to a lot of convenient places and the buses even more so.  Chicago's bus system is much more extensive than the two other major cities in the U.S., so there really is a bus that goes everywhere.  The facilities are usually clean and the staff are OK to deal with.  Usually the staff in the train stations are jerks who are stunned to find out riders actually have questions or need help with something.  I've found that I just say hi to them if they're around and go on my way - that turns the experience into a pleasant one.  The bus drivers are usually much nicer, especially if you're nice to them.  They also remember you if you take the same bus everyday - it's really nice.  All in all, I've experienced the same crap as everyone else (bus doesn't come for 35 minutes, train is late because of construction, etc.) but I'd rather have the transit system that we do now than a less efficient, less-extensive one."

170,1,"Mar 26, 2011","I have never, ever been on time using the green line. I do not recommend it as it is guaranteed to generate a raging, homicidal mood. Usually the train has stopped because either: Someone got mugged or yet another passenger has passed out- during this time the driver will have stopped the train, with the doors open to freezing weather, litter aflutter, every half-sober passenger clutching cheap cell phones cranked up and blaring heavy static trying to emulate music, aggressive panhandlers... And it smells like a port-a-potty.Also, once a passenger dropped their groceries and the car, including me, were covered in flour. I swore. A lot. (For the record, I look little, but I was raised in a big Italian family that works primarily in law enforcement and the military. I can curse colorfully enough to make most cable TV squeamish). It definitely scared the other passengers and I was the smallest person there. Plus I looked like Lindsay Lohan on a bender- and that is simply terrifying.

171,4,"Sep 2, 2011","I want to give CTA five stars, but I cannot. Some of the bus lines just don't do well enough.That having been said, CTA, for the most part, rocks my world. The reason is that I just returned to my lovely hometown after living in a mass transit desert, known as the L.A. area, for what seemed like forever. So compared to that, CTA is truly outstanding. I'll take it over sitting in that horrendous, life-paralyzing traffic in L.A. ANY DAY. Even in a blizzard. Yes, even when it is pouring down rain. You know why? Because I have options! I can get to many places in the city by train, bus or a combo. AND, if I opt for an unlimited monthly pass, it amounts to under 1K a year, unlike running a car, which is 8-10K or more. For that alone, CTA is the bomb diggity. Just try doing that in L.A. NOT! Even the poorest of poor people (and there are plenty) in L.A. are riding around in gross polluting cars, getting into accidents and putting other's lives in danger, because many do not even have a driver's license, let alone insurance. No thank you. Oh, and, in case you're wondering, that is in EVERY part of the city. People of low means are driving EVERYWHERE in L.A., because you pretty much have to, if you plan on leaving where you live for any reason, like, say -- work or anything else. Yes, there are some CTA routes that are worse than others. Yes, there are delays. But I've learned to pad my time so that I get to places early or at least on time. It doesn't always work, but, hey .... most of the time I do just fine!Yes, there are some crackpots who ride mass transit. I find these folks entertaining, as long as I am not in physical danger. Here's a tip: sit in the first car, so you're near the driver, if you're squeamish. It's no guarantee, but it's a good idea, especially if it's late. Oh, and be smart about riding late at night. Better to catch a cab than worry, in some of those cases. I believe that if you can live close in along an L train, you're golden. The bus/train combo, unless it is an express, kinda sucks. When I lived 2 blocks from the Red Line I thought I'd died and gone to mass transit heaven. It was just that sublime. I could be at anywhere I needed to be in under around 1/2 hour, since I lived downtown. SCORE! I never even had to check a schedule, because even on weekends, evenings and holidays, they came every few minutes - and I do mean few. Oh, is that a train I hear coming? So what! There'll be another one in around 6 minutes - so no need to run. It just doesn't get any better than that, as far as I am concerned."
172,1,"Sep 2, 2011","I decided to write a review on CTA bus line #155 since I rely upon it heavily to get from the Loyola Red Line stop to and from home.First, this line is almost never on time. No matter what bus tracker says, either the bus is running late, with another one right behind it, or it shows up whenever. I don't expect that a bus is on time always, but this line is bordering on the ridiculous. So much so that I sent in a complaint to the CTA tonight. When this bus does finally show up - the bus stop is so full of people that you then get to ride a packed bus, while another one just sails by you, empty. In fact, I really dislike taking this bus so much that I am going to have to figure out another route for myself - along with moving closer into the city. The area this bus line serves is just too darn far. There's nothing around here - so any time I'm going to do anything, I'm looking at a minimum of 45 minutes to an hour to get to a part of the city that actually has something decent to do. Tonight, I started coming back from downtown at 8pm and did not arrive home until almost 10pm. Arrrrgggggh. This is because the thing was so late (again, with another one right behind it) - it took me nearly 2 hours to get home from downtown. That's just unacceptable.This is why I was looking for a place on the Red Line that was 4 blocks away from it or less. The apt service I used lied to me, and they rushed me through signing a lease without verifying that my needs were met. While this is my fault too, I still feel like I was blatantly lied to. I'd made it clear what I wanted, and they just didn't deliver. Live and learn.So, a word of warning: when you are shown apartments, don't sign anything until you verify that it really meets your needs in terms of transit. I wouldn't live anywhere that you have to rely upon this bus. Can you imagine waiting outside in the freezing cold 30 minutes or more? Not okay."
173,1,"Jan 27, 2009","I have been riding the CTA since I was in the womb.I'm a born-and-bred Chicagoan who grew up in a family of six with one car. We know and still depend on the CTA. I have been taking it first to school, then work daily for the past six years. I've had a few near-mishaps on the Blue Line and survived a fire on the Red Line, but what occured last week makes me disgusted.My brother takes the Blue Line (Forest Park branch) to UIC where's he's a part-time Sophomore.Last Wed. afternoon he was riding in his train car, alone, around 1 pm reading his books. Two men entered his car from another through the emergency doors. This was while the train was in motion between the Oak Park and Harlem stops. The first guy threatened by brother for his wallet, or he'd ""kill him."" My brother acted too fast and punched the guy without thinking. The second came up, strangled him till he went unconsious and took only his wallet, which had no plastic and only $40 in cash.The Oak Park police found him unconsious at the Forest Park station, and he came to and had stitches done at Rush Hospital Oak Park.CTA isn't returning calls or responding to our emails. It was only an aggravated assualt and battery. Honestly, I know its a big city. There's always crime, and desperate times produce desperate acts. But can the CTA bring back the conductors from years past? At least acknowledge a crime this grave occured?I can't believe Daley now wants Huberman as the head of the CPS. Well, I can, it is Chicago."
174,1,"Mar 1, 2009","I love public transportation mostly for the entertainment value. It's not reliable, cheap, or fast but I will allow a little extra time in my day because I am guaranteed to witness at least one random act of stupidity that raises the bar each and every time I ride.I never expect for it to come from a bus DRIVER though. Usually the driver is my go-to guy (or gal) if I ever feel unsafe.  If shit's going down, I slowly inch my way toward the driver.However, last Thursday on my way home from work, the bus pulled to my stop and I headed to the front door. As I left, I gave a friendly salutation to the driver, ""Thanks a lot! Take care!""His response still gives me the creeps.

Have a good day"" Doors close and he drives off without giving anyone a chance to get on or off the bus. There were a few people on this bus, whether or not they were being held against their will; I have no idea. I like to think this was just a bus driver trying to have a little fun messing with a stranger, but the guy kept a straight face the entire time and so did everyone on the bus (aside from a few questioning glances at each other). Other than this strange interaction my bus and train rides are usually incidence free although not always the most efficient. A solid A-OK experience."

I will take off two stars for that.I personally can't complain because it gets me where I want to go when I want to go there and it is still cheaper than driving and parking and less stress than driving and parking. I don't worry about delays because I always plan ahead that there may be a delay regardless of my mode of transportation."
182,4,"Jan 6, 2008","I recently visited Chicago for a  week and the $20 I spent on my 7 day CTA pass was by far the best $20 I spent the whole trip.  I mostly stuck to the trains, but also caught a few buses here and there.  I thought the trains ran fairly consistently, never had to wail too long on a platform and appreciated the little heat that those heat lamps put out.  Some of the stations were under construction/skanky, but it didn't seem like any beams were about to fall on my head.The buses were great for getting to those places that the trains were just not close enough to.  I was really impressed with how frequently the buses ran.  I HATE waiting for buses, but every time i tried to walk anywhere here, a bus came trudging along.   The map was pretty easy to read and understand, and buses ran on like every other street.As for the piss/Vomit smell people seem to love?  I don't have a very good sense of smell.  So far in life this has been pretty handy for these sorts of situations, I just hope I don't have a gas leak in my apartment anytime.Maybe living here and dealing with public transit is a bit different, but my one week experience was pretty darn good."
183,1,"May 29, 2013","CTA is notoriously disgusting. CTA employees don't care about anyone. They sleep on the job. In fact, there's a Facebook page that's solely designed to show the pitfalls of this shitty option. Check out: ""People of the CTA"" on Facebook. You won't regret it.I just had a thought: homeless people that lay out newspaper on the seats are actually very, very smart. Rightly so, patrons should be laying down newspaper... especially on the Red Line.CTA listen up: they're building Divvy Bike Stands aaaaaaaaall over the city. They're placing one in front of my pad and in front of my office. You can bet your ace that I'll be using them instead of the train. I won't have to see anyone jerkin' it on my way to work anymore. If I were you, it would be your competitive prerogative to clean up the trains before more people use bikes - rates are already sky high. CTA workers definitely don't earn the money the city is shoveling out to your pensions. Have you SEEN Washington DC's subways?! They're immaculate and practically hallowed ground they're so nice.

185,1,"Dec 8, 2016",Worst.  Public.  Transport.  Ever.  Frequent and I mean frequent delays.  Compact seating - people might as well sit on each other because the seating is all made for stick figures.  Don't get me started on the cleanliness of the carriages or how it is packed often with very odiferous regulars riding the train because it's warm.  Get ready to experience being a sardine in a sardine tin during most rush hours- rushing to pack oneself into a car only to have the bloody train sit for 5-10 minutes before going for 2 minutes before stopping regularly due to 'track work' or 'unforeseen' emergencies.  Don't expect to get to your destination on time.
186,2,"Jan 18, 2007","Have you ever compared the CTA to the Tube in London or a metro in virtually any other large European city?  Yes, compared to US cities, the NETWORK of trains is pretty good.  However, what good is a network of tracks when a large percentage of them are in disrepair (we're talking cracks in the metal everywhere, people, not just chipping paint) causing the trains to have to go 10mph for fear of DERAILING?  Chicago deserves MUCH better.  A great city, a world-class city as our lovely mayor points out repeatedly, should have a world-class transport system, right?  Hell, I'd settle for an ADEQUATE system.  Quick story: As a public transportation enthusiast, when I moved to Chicago 8 months ago, I was STOKED to ride the CTA to work... relaxing, efficient, eco-friendly, etc.  After the big SNAFU with the derailment downtown in early July (?) 2006 and the myriad ""slow zones"" that were added as a result, it started to take me about 10 extra minutes to get to work (previously a 15 min ride, now 25 mins).  When I realized it now takes me less than 1/2 the time to drive to work, even during rush hour, I started to commute by car.  The goal of public transportation should be to remove cars from the road, NOT to force otherwise happy customers to add them to the already bad traffic.  CTA gets two stars, only because the trains DO get people from point A to point B.  It fails to get any more stars because of the gross mismanagement of the otherwise very nice transport network imposed by the excuse-harboring, managerially incompetent, Daley-machine-appointed Frank Kreusi and the ragtag group of other inept appointees running the system into the ground.PS: from a visitor's perspective, I can see how there's much to like.  However, once you live with it every day, it becomes enraging to see cars speeding past your train at 3x the speed when you're running a little late for work, especially because simple, preventable maintenance would stop the delays."

Seriously, try getting around in a driving city like Atlanta or L.A. - you'll be wishing you were on the El when you're sitting in traffic.  Coming from a city where you pretty much need to drive everywhere, the CTA was a huge boon during our car-less stay in Chicago.  I was able to go wherever I needed with relative ease and minor expense.  Travelling around the city like I did was really nice.  It also was a glaring reminder of the transit problems my own city has - trying to get around Atlanta like I did in Chicago would be impossible.  Pros- The train & bus system is large enough that you can actually get to where you want to go (please take note, Atlanta).  It seems like almost everyone uses mass transit which is pretty cool.    - It was pretty easy getting wherever I needed to go using a combination of subway and bus.  Cons- Efficiency was lacking a bit: trains just randomly stopping, delays, lights going out on the train, etc.  Atlanta trains are actually better in this regard which is pretty shocking (though ATL trains are much more limited in their usefulness).  - I wish there were more places to buy passes in the actual terminals.  Leaving the terminal to go to a grocery store to buy a transit pass seemed kind of stupid.  - Crazy people (jittery, mumbling dude yelling ""Wake me up when we play the fuckin' Yankees!"" repeatedly to no one).  I guess there are always crazy people on trains though so there's not much you can do about that.Overall, despite some operational issues, I thought the train and bus system in Chicago was pretty useful and fairly timely.

We lack that ability in Chicago.  I say this after 15 years of public transportation experience.  It used to be much better in this city. It now truly stinks.  I find it embarrasing that upon arriving at ORD, one must suffer on a dirty, jostling train ride for nearly an hour!  ONE HOUR!  Horrifying.  ""Welcome to Chicago....barring any delays, (but there will likely be a few)  we'll have you into the city proper in ONE HOUR!""The other embarrasing fact is that our system lacks access for travelers with bags or people with disabilities.  I recently helped one traveler, who mistakenly got off at the Grand stop on the Blue Line, while struggling up about 50 stairs with her large suitcase.  Not a warm welcome, to say the least.Chicago's a great city...but this experience is not a part of that greatness and, really, given that it is now minimally functioning on some lines, we should truly call a spade a spade.  2nd City (again)."

195,2,"Jan 25, 2011","I take the train or the bus every day and some days are better than others. But the CTA needs to either give up or catch up with the other public transit systems in the world. I've been fortunate enough to travel and experience quite a few different systems and ours is like the ugly, stupid stepchild compared to others I've seen. The first thing that needs to change... Post train arrival times at ALL stations. Installing big flat screen tvs at some stops only to show advertisements and sports news was a giant tease and most people would agree, a huge waste of resources. Now post arrival times as well and I won't start off every morning in a foul ass mood."
196,4,"Jul 5, 2007","Normally, I love the CTA. I will get on the el and just ride around people watching when I'm basically broke and I need to get out of the house. I ride the blue line down 290 pointing at laughing at people stuck in traffic jams. I've had people shoot me the bird, and in response I usually smile and wave like the driver and I are old chums. Oh, the fun, it just don't stop.But this crap they pulled Tuesday night after the fireworks, with the els being broken, that was ridiculous. First, nobody would tell us what the problem was. Second, the workers (at least at the Quincy stop) who knew perfectly well that the trains were broken were still letting people put their cards into the turnstiles so the CTA could get their $2.Third, I don't think it was an accident. Didn't they threaten to shut down every el line except the blue and red if they didn't get funding from the state? And weren't the blue and red lines the only ones running on one of the busiest public transportation nights of the year?I don't think that's a coincidence. I think it's crap, flat out.But generally, yeah, it's a great system. $4 round trip is a hell of deal when compared to $16-$30 for parking, plus gas used sitting in traffic. The CTA has serious problems about four or five times a year, where as traffic is bad pretty much every freaking day.So get on the el, give public transportation a whirl. Ride it more often than you do now, if you can. Save money, mix among the common folk, spend some time reading the paper or staring blankly out the window.    Do something for which you can respect yourself in the morning, for crying out loud."

The panhandlers are more aggressive (one has been written up in the Tribune for his numerous arrests related to this) and there is a pretty high rate of snatch-and-run crimes.  In fact I rode it again yesterday and a hapless young lady lost her phone just this way; the CTA employees yelled at her not to run after but she didn't listen, this stopped the train for a bit.    There is a little of this on the El everywhere but it just seems more concentrated here.  Otherwise the service on the train is pretty standard and its not any dirtier or cleaner than any other trains that I can see.

201,4,"Apr 18, 2009","I heart the CTA, I wish we had half as good of a system in Seattle, but we don't, and for all you haters of the CTA try traveling a little and you will see how good you have itI love the Visitors Pass we are here for the weekend and $14 for 3 days and it covers trains and buses, you can't beat that with a stick.so we took the blue line into the City from O'hare then got on the Red Line to Addison and walked to our hotel on Broadway that's the other good thing with all the rich and fattening food I will eat this weekend we walk a lot with using public transportation, and it allows us to see stuff you would miss if driving a car"
202,4,"Dec 7, 2012","While the locals seem to have their share of complaints about the CTA, for someone like me visiting Chicago or simply going from Midway to O'Hare, the CTA is a godsend. And as far as transit systems go it's always worked quite well for my needs. I prefer the Red Line as that takes me to Wrigleyville and places where I have fun, the Orange Line and Blue Line are what always take me home or send me on my way elsewhere. I've only had one issue with a ticket machine in all the years I've used the CTA. I love being able to order Transit Cards online, and the bottom line is when I board a CTA train for the most part I know it's going to get me where I need to be. One thing I will say...standing on a Red Line platorm at 4 am in the winter during a snowstorm was one of the coldest experiences I've ever had. Burrrrr! But the train still was on time. 4 Stars."
203,4,"Mar 29, 2012","This review is for rail service, Blue, Red, and Orange Lines. The CTA is my preferred way to get from Midway / O'Hare to the loop. Access from Midway to the Orange Line is a breeze, and once you find the station at O'Hare the ride to downtown is fast. When you look out the windows at the traffic parked on the Kennedy you'll be thinking your ticket is a sweet deal. The Red Line takes me to Cubs games and to many of the places I like to go in Chicago...and it's my favorite line to ride. For someone from out of town riding the CTA late at night can be...well...interesting. It's also great for people watching....ever seen flight attendants put on makeup as a train car is rocking back and forth at 50 mph at 4 am? I have, and they always look good when they get off onto the platform. In 15+ years of going to Chicago and riding the L I have always felt safe on the trains. When you get off the train and leave the platforms that can be little interesting depending on where you are but I've never had any issues on the trains especially coming or going to the airports.Tip: Passes / Unlimited Ride Cards are the ONLY way to go if you're going to make more than 1 ride on the CTA. $5.75 for one day, $14 for 3 Days. Tip: For Android Phones download the Chicago Transit Tracker App. I've tried the other apps CTA recommends but this is the one I keep coming back to."
204,4,"Sep 2, 2008",This is based on the facilities at Lake Street. I had to go here to pick up my new CTA Chicago Plus Card. I did order a replacement since the one I had for over 2 years stopped working. I waited for a month for the new card to show in the mail. It never did so I went to the headquarters to pick it up.The CTA building is very nice and modern! The lady at the window that helped me was new and didn't really know what was going on. She was able to give me my new card and added a transit check that I had to my account. I left a happy camper with my new card that actually works now!
207,3,"Oct 23, 2008","Yeah the CTA is f'd up financially.  YEah they periodically bandy about disaster scenarios to scare up support for more $$$.  Here's a fact most folks don't want to admit: you pay way less for a ride on this than you actually should.  Go to DC, or the Metro in Paris, or SanFran, or Milan or anywhere else with an even comparable service....those are better but are also more expensive. That said, we have pretty damn good public transportation for what we pay. Shit, I personally love that i can go weeks without touching my car and not miss it.  Would love to see 'em bring back streetcars as well.  Pretty much 24/7 there is a city employee whose job it is to take my drunk ass home.  This is a beautiful thing for 2 bucks a pop."
208,3,"Mar 4, 2008","Being a visitor to Chicago, I give the CTA a three star rating, although I would have preferred to give it 2.5.   The CTA does seem to be fairly comprehensive.  My husband and I used the Blue Line to get out to the Allstate Arena to meet our friends for a Chicago Wolves game.  Our friends advised us to allow extra time, telling us to add about 30 minutes to the time we estimated to get out there.  That, and the ""L"" doesn't serve the Arena directly.  One has to get off at Rosemont to change to a bus.If you are staying Downtown (or near Downtown) however, you can't beat the CTA for getting around.  We stayed at the Ambassador East,  and while it was a bit of a walk to the Red Line, the buses on nearby Local Lake Shore Drive went directly to Michigan Avenue, the Loop, and the Museums.  The CTA does sell visitor passes, which allow for unlimited rides.  They are also useful if you live in Chicago and plan on doing extensive riding for a day or two."
209,5,"Dec 23, 2008","In no other city that I have lived or visited have the trains and many of the bus lines run 24 hours a day. In other cities, trains cost you based on the distance you travel, often ending up in $7 fares.I'll take $2, or even $2.25, and all night service, over any of that.While it's not 100% reliable, no public transit system in a city the size of Chicago can be. Plus, with the slow zones reduced to tiny bits of track, the Blue line is like the Zoom line now.CTA, I love you."
210,5,"Oct 16, 2012","I can appreciate a good public transit system when I ride one!  CTA was reliable, efficient, EASY TO NAVIGATE, and GENERALLY, clean!  As a recent Chicago city tourist, I was able to take CTA easily from the airport to my downtown location, and then ALL AROUND the city.  All the lines are colored differently and so it makes it so easy to navigate and ask around for directions.  It actually reminded me of the monopoly board... it literally had all the colors, brown, pink, red, blue, green, ect. There's also something I love about taking public transit... Just the feeling of hopping onto a bus/subway, through all the hustle & bustle of life... and you literally see all different kinds of people walk on and out.  I'll stop there before I get too philosophical... lol! But I appreciate the moment when you can just people watch and take a moment to collect your thoughts before you continue on with your day... : )TIP: 3 day pass is $14 and it lasts for 72 hours from first use.  For all google map phone users, it has EXCELLENT/ACCURATE directions!"
211,4,"Mar 16, 2013",Pretty solid public transpo system. I've seen better (Hong Kong!) but this is definitely convenient and easy to use. I actually thought the buses were the best part - the train schedule is kinda inconsistent depending on where you are. Would hate to drive in this city. Yay cta
212,4,"Nov 18, 2008","I am from Michigan.  I had heard of this thing called ""public transportation,"" but of course I assumed it was a myth, like sidewalks and foreign cars. Then I moved to Chicago and saw this mythical beast... I fell in love immediately.So as much as people complain about the CTA it still gets you where you need to go."
213,2,"Mar 28, 2007","The trains are noisy.  Very noisy.  When underground, the hiss is deafening... moreso than any other public transportation system I've ridden on.There is ALWAYS a delay on the trains.  ALWAYS.  Seriously... no matter how often they work on the track, it always seems to be mucked up.  ALWAYS.  How is that possible?  For all the time they spend working on it you'd think it would actually, you know, be working once in a while.  But no.  And it's just gonna get worse whatwith the improvements (which are needed, so... meh).Do you need to use an elevator?  Tough.  Most stations don't have one... and those that do, well... you have a 50/50 chance of the elevator's actually working.  Sorry.  Of course, that's one of the ""improvements"" they're making... so kudos.  We'll see how that goes, now won't we?The buses are ALWAYS late.  ALWAYS.  I've waited for buses for half and hour without seeing one going in EITHER direction and finally decided to walk.  About 20 minutes into my walk I saw 4 (!!!) in a row pass in the other direction (never did see one going in my direction during the 45 minute walk).  And events like this aren't rare... not at all.The trains and buses are VERY dirty.  For the $2 each way they charge (more expensive than most other cities, even cities with higher property/upkeep costs, and about the same as New York, which has MUCH higher property/upkeep costs), you get to sit in trash.  And if you're from Boston or San Francisco and used to bringing your dog on the train/bus with you... forget about it.  That's the one rule they DO enforce (I E-mailed them about it - their excuse was that they were weary of the clean-up costs... wtf???  It's not like they clean anyway).All public transportation systems have problems... but Chicago's is REALLY bad.  Hopefully it will get better... I'm giving 2 stars just because apparently they're (finally) trying to address the problems and make improvements (though it's just gonna be eve worse for a few years while they do so).  Oh... and the trains run late (often until 2am or so), which is rad, and major props for that.  *note: I realise no public transportation system is clean... but gripe is that they overcharge for the luxury of not cleaning, then turn around and use the argument of ""extra cleaning"" as a scapegoat for not allowing dogs."
214,5,"Jan 3, 2013","Lost my Chicago Card yesterday. Didn't notice it until 5 p.m. Promptly spent 45 minutes looking through every pocket (several times) and everywhere else I might have stowed it. After concluding it was gone, I went online to cancel the missing card and request a new one. That only took a couple of clicks. Then I had to choose whether I wanted the new card mailed to me, or whether I'd pick it up at ""CTA headquarters"" (where it would be available ""immediately"" - albeit during business hours - fair enough). I chose to pick it up at the CTA headquarters which is two blocks from the Ogilvie Transportation Center.  While there was no CTA signage on the outside of the building, the neon buses and el trains in the lobby confirmed I'd found the right place. Up the stairs to the second floor, and in three minutes I was on my way with a replacement card and a kind word from the very helpful clerk. Thanks."
215,5,"Jul 7, 2010","On one of the busiest weekends in Chicago, I happily never encountered one single problem with the CTA. In the past I'd seen stampedes, trains breaking down and causing massive delays in subways and long lines of angry people waiting for buses that never show up on time. 4th of July weekend was hectic and crowded but it looks like enough people had enough sense to think ahead of time and buy their transit cards ahead of time so there was hardly any clogs in the system that weekend. I appreciate the facelifts some of the stations have gone under, the lack of urine on the subway stairs-especially the Chicago and State red line stop and electronic updates.A great thing about the CTA is that it's still only $2.25 to hop on a train and get from one length of the city to the other. When you tell someone from the bay area it's $2.25 to get from Howard to downtown, it's a massive relief to not pay upwards of $20 for one train ride. The amount spent on public transportation for the 5 days spent in Chicago cost the same for a BART ride from downtown to the airport."
216,4,"Jul 25, 2011","I look at some of the reviews of the CTA.  Let me say this: Columbus, Cincinnati, and Indianapolis are good, nice cities.Chicago, however, is a GREAT city.  Why?  The CTA.  I envy Chicago because of the good, strong public transportation available to residents, suburbanites, and visitors alike.  Chicago, because it is a big city with much of the troubles and seedy element of any city, has some interesting people who ride it.  People who smell.  Are drunk.  Sometimes even those who will drink while riding on the 'L'.  But guess what, it's PUBLIC transportation!  And there are many well-behaved, bathed, civil and well-dressed (and good-looking) people who ride the trains and buses throughout the city.Transit in Chicago has always been rough, and the CTA, according to history, as seen MUCH WORSE days.  But they have upgraded stations, vehicles, rail cars, and track to keep a good level of service, and keep and attract residents and business, and oh so many visitors, giving them affordable (and fun) ways to move throughout the city, whether they flew into Midway of O'Hare, took Amtrak, or drove into town.""L"" Service is frequent throughout the day, and on weekends as well.  Evening service is not bad.  Red and Blue lines? 24 hour sevice!  Bus routes are also plentiful, some of them running late/overnight (I think) and fairly frequent.  Chicago has invested greatly in its transit infrastructure: it shows, and other midwest cities could learn a few lessons here...Chicago Transit Authority.  Why Chicago is not like Cincinnati,  Or St. Louis.  And especially Detroit!"
219,4,"Apr 18, 2013","This is my review of my experience of going in to the office to get my replacement Chicago Card Plus.  Let me preface this by saying I wanted to have a bad time, I wanted to wait in line, I wanted to just rip it a new one, as I've waited three weeks for a new CTA card to no avail.  I wanted it to be grimey, and dirty, and unfriendly. It was none of these things.I got there 5 minutes before they opened, and was directed where to go by friendly security desk people. At precisely 8am, the rope was pulled back so I could go up the stairs to the sales office. at around 8:02, the doors were unlocked and I was greeted by a friendly CTA employee, and by 8:06 I was on the street walking to my office.The location was clean, easy to navigate, and bright. The employees I happened to encounter were friendly, talkative, fast, and efficient. Damn it, CTA. Damn it for giving me an awesome customer service experience."

221,4,"Jun 10, 2011","Because I do not have the 4-door, 30mpg-or-greater Honda Civic I've been dreaming of for years, I take public transportation, and here in the Chicagoland metropolitan area, there are three main systems-CTA, Metra, and Pace. I've reviewed Metra and Pace, now here I am reviewing CTA. The best way for me to do it is to list what I like and what I don't like about CTA.My likes:Small faresService 24/7/365 or 366Plenty of bus routes inundating the whole city5000-series cars on trainsRock in Cumberland terminalThomas Jefferson statue at Jefferson Park terminalClark/Lake L stationDrunks are not allowed to board the busesTakes me to many destinations24/7/365 or 366 train serviceEasy to use, in comparison to NYC's subway system which is equateable to a bowl of spaghetti (no, seriously)Purple, Orange, and Brown L linesNow, my dislikes:Criminals are allowed to use CTAVery little securityHomeless people that never used soap and water in their lives are allowed to use CTA buses/trainsHomeless people and drunks peeing and defecating on buses and trains and at stations/terminalsTrains and buses don't go very far into Metra/Pace territory (in other words, the suburbs) expand the Blue Line to Schaumburg, preferably Woodfield or Northwest Transportation Center, please!Train elevators forever smell like pissSoliciting runs rampant on Red LineFar too many ghetto people ridingAttitude of a good clump of CTA employees is just absolutely freakin' warped and twistedI love pigeons, sparrows, starlings, and robins, but CTA doesn't bother cleaning up their poop on station/terminal platforms. What? You want me to do it? Okay, give me the supplies I need to do so!Looks like I have more dislikes regarding the CTA than likes, but overall, I love this transit system and I will be damned, literally, if it along with Pace and Metra disappear completely. Cars cost too freakin' much to maintain. Oh thank God for public transit, something I never have and never will, take for granted."
222,1,"Feb 22, 2011","Many of the people who ride this L line scare me. It runs through the most crime/drug/gang-infested neighborhoods in all of Chicago and that's why it experiences so many problems in terms of crime and negative incidents. I've read online from many riders who have been robbed or assaulted or saw fights on the train while riding the Green Line, and that was enough to make me reluctant to get on a train to go somewhere.The only good thing about the Green Line trains is that they usually run on time and run often, but other than that, I'm taking the Blue or even the Red Line, and definitely the Orange Line, to get to wherever I'm going, for safety's sake."
223,4,"Jun 29, 2009","Ok, CTA employees restored my faith in humanity.....  I am a flight attendant, and I take the good, OLE blue line to and from O'hare to my home in the loop.  The Dearborn Street subway construction is getting really really old.  Last week, I was stuck on the train at Grand because there was a one track operation at Clark and Lake, because of said construction.  we were at Grand for almost 30 minutes while we had to wait for O'hare bound trains to clear.  That's all well and good, and I, of all people, understand about delays, ect.  But after 30 minutes of sitting there, I REALLY had to ""powder my nose!""  I walked off of the train and headed to the first car where the train operator was, and asked him how much longer we would be sitting here.  He smiled and politely told me the situation, and that we would be waiting for at least 2 more O'hare trains to pass before we would be able to move.  I asked him if there was any way that I could use the restroom upstairs.  He then tried to find the supervisor to see if I could, but he had just disappeared down the tracks. He told me that I had plenty of time to go and come back and the train would be still sitting at the station.  He then told me to go up and tell the security guy that the conductor said I could use the bathroom at the station.  I thanked him and ran up top.The security guy wouldn't let me use the station bathroom, but he told me what restaurant I could go to and use theirs, and he promised to let me back in when I came back.  Skeptical, but desperate, I followed his advice and off I went.  When I came back, he DID remember me, and let me back down, and the train was STILL sitting there.  I hopped back on the train in my same seat, and not 2 minutes later we FINALLY on our way.Now I am sure the operator was getting bombarded with angry people wanting to know how much longer, long before I asked him myself.  The fact that he calmly, and politely answered my questions and request impressed me.  The fact that the security guy could have been a complete jerk and not let me back down to the train again, but didn't impressed me too.  They didn't have to help me as much as they did, but the fact that they did.  I wish the CTA had more employees like these."
224,2,"Apr 28, 2009","I am grateful that we have the CTA, but after using mass transit in, London, Paris, Brussels, Washington DC, San Francisco, NYC, Boston, Dublin, just to name a few, the CTA is a JOKE!!!What's the point of raising prices if the crappy service stays the same?  I have no problem with raising fares if the increase is used to improve the infrastructure and overall service is improved, not the CEOs wallets getting fatter.And what's up with doing away with the Chicago Card plus bonus for putting $20 at a time on it?  What's the point now, I might as well pay cash.  It's not like I can go with another mass transit system in Chicago.  In Paris, a one way ticket costs about 1.90 USD each way, but if you buy 10 tickets at once you get  a huge price break.  10 tickets are 10 euros or about $13.50 .  Ten rides on the CTA is double that, and the service is a fraction of what the Metro in Paris is!"

I have nothing but love for the CTA.My one disclaimer is that I don't wear a watch, and I always carry a book.  I have become more literate waiting for the CTA than I have waiting for any other public transit system in any other city."

The buses are ok.  I had to take one today and was a little surprised that the reroutes for the chicago marathon weren't posted.  This was particularly an issue because the neighborhood where I was (along the 29 state line) seemed pretty dependent on the bus and a lot of little old people were forced to walk blocks and blocks and blocks.  Then when we got closer to my stop, I was listening, but didn't know the route.  In DC, at least, the voice announces the next stop.

The CTA gets me everywhere.  I don't know many of the bus routes yet but I am a short walk to the Fullerton stop and a short walk to the Clark Street bus stop.

230,3,"Aug 2, 2009","As a middle-class resident of West Town, CTA works great for me. I can buy passes at my Blue Line stop, at either of the closest grocery stores, or the Currency Exchange down the street. I have the internet and a credit card, so I can even order a Chicago Card delivered right to my door with no hassle at all. This summer, I took the bus or the train with my students every day. My students are from the real west side, and things weren't so easy for them. To get permits to use their reduced fare passes, they would have needed phone access, a guardian with the time and mobility to find, fill out and submit applications, two dollars, and an address for the permits to be sent to. At least two of those things would have proved insuperable obstacles to most of the children, and they would have spent the summer either indoors or unsupervised. Neither of those options are all that much fun. Chicago summers are amazing because of how many free, fun things happen every day - look at the Millennium Park schedule, the events happening at the library, the beaches, movies in the parks, all the different cultural festivals - but in order to take advantage of these opportunities, you need to use the CTA. We ended up getting passes for all the kids, but no permits. The real reason my students and I had such a wonderful summer was that CTA stations are staffed by human beings. No individual is going to tell a group of schoolkids that they can't go play on the beach with their teachers. I felt bad for putting CTA employees in that position, but I also felt angry that CTA itself made it so incredibly difficult for us to follow the letter of the law."

Thanks to my Chicago Card, I pass through the turnstiles without breaking stride every morning and afternoon to and from work.  I admit to blaming the CTA for being late far many times more than the CTA has actually made me late.   It's a nice scapegoat.  I am late to work because I have an unhealthy addiction to the snooze button.  There are maybe five occasions all year where I was actually delayed due to the CTA.  Think anyone around here can say the same about the highways?    It's not perfect and never will be.  I was temped to give three stars but for all the times train drivers have re-opened the doors as I'm running up to the platform, I must give four.   The trains and buses are usually clean and as a Chicago newbie, the drivers are always helpful when I ask questions.Now, if they could just do something about five lines sharing the damn loop elevated.

I said ""give me a minute, let me check"", then take a seat. My card had only €.25, so I manually add $20 in my card. Then, I went up to tab my card again, it still didn't work. I showed him my account with $20.25 in it. He said ""you hold the bus long enough"". I was like ""What"", and he repeated ""you have hold the bus long enough, I have to get on Lakeshore now"". Very frustrated! It was the company system that didn't auto load my card, and it was also the company system that didn't update my card fast enough.

The CTA is light years ahead of the SF Bay Area in Public transit. I hold the NYC Metro as the bar and after traveling all over the world, the subway runs all night, gets you just about anywhere, and is still fairly affordable. For me to go from my house and get around various places in SF I have to get on at least 2-3 different systems. That is ass. So CTA seems to get you to a ton of places for fairly cheap and with lots of locales. I thought the bus and EL  were fairly pleasant. Case in point, the bus couldnt take my $5 bill so the driver nicely said go ahead and sit down. He even gave me directions for where I was going.

If you don't like it, don't ride it. But if you don't have a car and don't want to cycle or walk somewhere, CTA is the best option for you.

You would be wrong.I don't believe that public transport should be privatized, and the CTA is a clear example of why not.  If something is subsidized by government money, it should have to meet government standards, which (if they were to exist..) may prohibit exploiting minority populated areas, catering to more wealthy districts, and oh i don't know,  filling with smoke every now and again.The people who work for the cta have a lot to deal with and by no means is this problem theirs to bear. Raising the fare is maybe the only way to pay the staff a fair wage, and i understand this...but perhaps if money hadn't been mismanaged and quick fixes used for so long we wouldn't be paying for it now. Raising fares, more advertisements, and a gift shop? then why is there a DECREASE in service?p.s. the cta's scam where you HAVE to buy a u-pass unless you are disabled is insane. I'm glad it is 85 a semester for something i ethically don't support, cool."
241,3,"Apr 8, 2008","The CTA gets credit for functionality, it works if it is going where you are going.   It even gets credit for attempting to maintain itself despite gross mismanagement.  But loses stars for political mishandling of public funds.  If Chicago didn't lose so much money to corruption, we may not have to wrangle with Illinois government for extra money.  I think taking on the olympics may be a bad idea.  I don't blame Daley alone, I blame all of em, the whole croney driven machine.  But the truth is the city wouldn't work without the CTA.  Imagine how nice it would be if it were well funded and well run?"

I was patiently waiting for the bus when... as it came, totally just passed me up! I managed to run to it's next stop (North ave & Lockwood, eastbound). When on, the bus driver was very inconsiderate, unconcerned, and refused to give me his badge number, or employee ID of any kind. The number written on the bus was 6797, the Ventra register on the bus had the 4-digit number of 1063. Completely dissatisfied with this his service, and others like him. Quite frankly, I'm fast, and can catch the bus even if they routinely miss their mark, but I write this because: WHO KNOWS HOW MANY OTHER PEOPLE HE'S PASSED UP, with no concern. This needs to stop."
246,3,"Sep 2, 2013","Overall, I had good experiences while riding around town on the trains a few weeks ago.  I felt safe, I was usually travelling with another person, but even on solo trips things were not overly shady.   I felt the announcements were easy to understand also.  I rode out to Midway, not knowing that it has a bad reputation, and it was the middle of the day so perhaps that makes a difference, no problems.Employees mostly  helpful, sometimes low on patience/energy, but if I had their job of dealing with people all the d*&% day I think I'd feel the same.p.s.  My friend who moved to Chicago from NYC had this to say concerning the people who come on the trains asking for money in the two places- in NYC there is more music etc and trying to entertain passengers, while in the midwest it's more like here's my sob story.  Yes, we know life can suck really fast for many people and you never know what could happen and it could happen to you!  For example, in Chicago we were riding the brown or red line, guy comes on and has major sores on his foot due to some infection.  He proceeds to tell the entire car, ""I'm only trying to raise 19$ for some medication for my foot.""  He didn't have insurance, but then again...neither do I.  p.p.s  This story has a happy ending, I hope.  There was a person riding in our car who told the guy that he worked at a hospital and to come to that hospital between certain hours and to ask for him and he'd get him a card so that he could get his medication or get some kind of health card.  Sounds promising, and one lady gave him some money.  I was not that lady, alas my conscious is not clear, but my heart is  like ice."
247,3,"Sep 2, 2012","Took the Southport Brown Line to the Loop on a Friday afternoon around 3:30 after spending the afternoon with my co-workers at Southport Lanes for our summer reunion.My trip was very enjoyable and far better than any experience I have ever had on the train.  This, in part, was due to the fact that it was a holiday weekend and the train was not crowded at all.  Also, it was super hot outside so the air conditioning was a big relief.  Also, it was very easy to get to the Loop and there are several stops you can get off at once you get to the Loop.I highly doubt I'll be as lucky to ride the train like that again, but overall, good experience.I'm not a big fan on the EL - I'm a suburbanite and take the Metra into the city, but if I have to take the EL then I will.Also, I highly recommend buying a day pass sold at Walgreens if you are visiting.  It makes getting on the train a lot easier if you already have a ticket."

249,4,"Sep 6, 2007","I would give it 5 stars, but since I don't live here and deal with the day to day grind of public transit in Chicago I had to deduct for tourist factors. I went to visit my very best girl friend over Labor Day weekend and I was impressed by the El system. The price is good (2.00!), it is easy to get places (airport, the loop, Wrigley Field, breakfast), and I LOVE how there is only ONE system! I love my San Francisco Muni system, but it has never made ANY sense to me why we have Muni for in the city and Bart for the outer bays and airport, just make ONE system! The ""old"" feel to the El in a city that looks very much ""new"" is one of the visual pluses in my book! The tracks remind me of the Disneyland train ride- this may or may not be a plus for everyone, but it is for me and it is my review. All and all- I LOVE Chicago. The El is just icing on an already tasty cake!"

251,1,"Jul 31, 2008","Ever wonder why you wait 20+ minutes until you see six thousand busses?Oh, right.

I know the three times I've been on it, it's been incredibly slow. And painfully packed.The blue line reminds me of a pet store. Take from that what you will. I have a love-hate relationship with the blue line.I still want to punch the #72 westbound bus.

254,2,"Apr 16, 2007","Compared to other cities I consider Chicago lucky to have our el and bus service, however my experience saturday night made me think twice about that.Orange line - if the last train leaves Midway at 12:55, why is it that at 12:45 I arrive only to find the doors locked, no one in the station an LED sign stating ""orange line not in service at this time""?? thanks for leaving me stranded in Cicero at 1a.m.  #62 bus - thankfully after a half hour wait I was able to take the 62 to the loop.Red line - NB trains not stopping at Roosevelt???  My expedition was half way over when I arrived at Roosevelt Rd. and State St.  Only to climb down the subway stairs to find a handwritten note ""no NB service"".  I waited with some others on the elevated platform for another half hour only to get frustrated.  Tired and crabby I walked down to street level to catch a cab when a train should appear.......""north bound red line to Howard"" states the conductor, WHAT THE F^#@!!!!Get your head out of your ass CTA."
255,3,"Dec 18, 2012",I am glad I got to experience this once in my life for the novelty of it.  I would probably venture on it again just because it is awesome that they have public transit and you can go all over on it if you know what the hell you are doing.  Me and three other ladies did indeed make it from our hotel out in the burbs to downtown Chicago with relative ease....We made it home too which I must say was not a smart move on our part.  Three ladies from the midwest cornfields of MN have no damn business on the public transit at 3 in the morning on a weekend.  It got a little dicey a few times and I had secretly been cussing myself out for not taking a cab.....But hey we did make it.  You will see some shit out there ---mental people walking around with urine and vomit on them talking to themselves and some thugs hanging out that look like they want to stab you.....If it isn't dark take it ---if you are bad-ass go ahead and take it.  Next time if it is night---I'm calling a Taxi----Oh yeah-----wear a mask and keep hand sanitizers handy---we all got sick as dogs after this trip....too many germs ...
258,2,"Dec 7, 2014","Yes, numerous Chicago citizens MUST rely on CTA services which is most assuredly a 'defenseless' position for any individual.  The shame comes in how this corporation annually and consistently raises the costs of commuting with expected vigilance, these days.  They began such fare increases back in the '70's but in the '70's raised the fares twice in one year!  That management crew was then ousted and shamed [by the media & citizens] for their overt and apparent attempt to siphon money from the corporation into their own pockets.  New management under the African-American female [whose name I fail to recall at this time] promised to never raise fares unjustly and without proper notice to the citizens.  But within a period of 2 measly years the new management reneged on that promise citing 'increased operational expenses' for old, worn out bus fleets and need for new fare boxes and transitioning from paper transfers to new CTA Fare Cards which the citizens did not mind, that time.Today I can only pray that the corporation is better at managing the corporation and not increasing fares as high as in the past.10/2017:  NEW UPDATE:Per a Chicago relative, the CTA has increased the fares but seemingly within range of customer affordability."
259,3,"Nov 14, 2006","My #66 route is hit or miss.  I love the rare times that I get the real feisty bus driver that likes to blow the red lights and honk at everybody.  Basically I don't feel like I'm making good time unless I'm being sloshed back and forth from fast braking action.  I get lucky with that type of driver once a week.  Most of the time I get stuck with the bus driver that is ahead of schedule and will deliberately take as long as possible to get to my destination.  I have been on buses were the bus driver will just idle at a several lights for more than 5 minutes...for no apparent reason...aside from the fact that I am now LATE.I think my biggest complaint would not be the CTA themselves but the horrid and foul-mouthed high school students that can be found at the back of the bus in the morning.  Those kids really need to find some other type of transportation, they ruin everybody's morning commute with their dopey ass antics and lame wisecracks.  OO burn you just made fun of my coach loafers that look like ""hush puppy shoes"" and pointed out the fact that I'm drinking a beverage, out of a cup, no less.  Stay in school jabronies but find a different way to get there or one of these days my so called ""looks like she is drinking a latte"" will be all over your face."
260,5,"Dec 1, 2008",My favorite mass transit system in the country. What I love about it is that it's relatively clean when compared to NYC's system. I also loved being able to buy a all day pass for just $5. And the machine took my debit card which was the best part! The CTA Blue and Brown lines were the ones we primarily stuck to and we enjoyed using both of them. We will definitely be using the CTA transit system next time er return to Chicago.
261,4,"Dec 7, 2008","Well, the people from Chicago, will tell ya, it is just like any public transportation like any other major city~ And with the age that shown from its wooden track and several stations, it has actually been keeping up fairly in great shape! From the point of view of a business traveler~CTA is MUCH quicker and efficient compares to the buses~ And just $20.00, you can ride however and wherever you want  for 7 Days! with all public transportations. In the bittering Chicago weather condition, some station even provides cozy services of the ""Warming Zone""How does that work? Well, with a semi open space, there will be several heating lights ready to heat you up, at the press of button. Still~ nothing beats the bittering wind of Chicago!"
262,3,"Apr 3, 2008","The CTA is a hit or miss, usually. Lately I seem to find myself muttering ""The CTA is trying to ruin my life"" quite a bit. I live at around 300 S., and work around 650 N., which on a nice day, with lots of time to spare, is a nice walk, but when its raining/snowing out and I'm running late for work, I need some sort of transportation quicker than my feet to get me there. Or when I'm tired after a long day of work, or it's really late out, I don't want to walk home. The 29 bus NEVER comes when I need it to, or it'll just drive past me. Happened a few times now. The 36 is pretty good, minus the driver that tried to kidnap me the other night, threatened to beat up the 'boyfriend' I made up as an excuse not to give him my phone number, asked if he could ""keep me"" and wouldn't open the bus doors for me to get off. The Red line has trouble being consistently underground, and seems to always NOT be running underground in the direction that I want to take it. However, I must admit it has been fairly consistent and quick getting me to work on time, and I havent had much of a wait at that station. Just watch all that change now that I wrote about it. Love my UPass, dont know what I'll do without it over summer.Some of the stations are pretty dirty and sketchy (ie: Grand), but I can tell they are really trying to fix some of them up (ie: belmont red/brown and Harrison Red). I also wish they would improve security so I would be a little more comfortable riding the train alone after work, etc.I complain about it, but I really don't know what I would do without the CTA."
263,1,"Nov 5, 2009","I hate you CTA. You always make me wait, freeze my buns off or make me sit in something that used to be inside another human being.I'm a native of Chicago. I've been riding the CTA for over 20 years. And it has never been pleasant, clean or on time. I mean ONCE in a while, they'll run their shiny new buses through the nicer more influential areas of Chicago, but it always buckles in quality eventually.I've been to many cities throughout the world and most cities, even post war-torn cities, have managed to build more efficient, clean and timely transit systems. I simply don't know why we can't get it together. Its not like we don't know winter is coming, its not like the streets are rearranging themselves like in the movie The Cube and its not like the transit habits of Chicagoans change all that drastically save for a festival or two in the summer and a sudden blizzard in the winter.CTA, I simply can't stand you. You and your greasy hand rails.:("
264,5,"Dec 25, 2009","Like another reviewer said ""You Chicagoans are spoiled!""I come from the LA/Orange County area and getting anywhere efficiently, cheaply, and environmentally friendly over here is damn near impossible. I am incredibly jealous of what you guys have over in Chicago. I've been to Chicago 4 or 5 times, even lived there for 2 months. The CTA and Metra systems can move you around so effectively it can make you feel like you'll never need or want a car again. Seriously, I don't get why they get a bad name but CTA rocks. I'm not saying its perfect, I mean, anyone ever sit on the Red line on the North Side for like 20 minutes not knowing why the hell the train stopped? But that's part of life in this city just enjoy it, leave early, and meet someone cool or interesting on the train....All while doing your part to stop global warming! :)"
265,4,"Nov 20, 2008",Last year when I actually came home for Christmas I was aware of the potential fare hike. Now that I am back this year for good there's another threat. Does anyone else think it's interesting they're bringing this issue up around election time? Maybe that's just me but I hope not cos my poor ass can't afford it.Anyhow for the most part I am satisfied with the service. Although there are a few drivers on the 84 Peterson who drive like they're the getaway car in a heist movie.And then there are the times where my friends and I like to refer to them as C**&^ Taking it up the A*^^ when the bus is over an hour late  and 4 going the opposite way have passed you. Still I can't hate them too much since I don't consider biking during the winter and too poor to consider cabs on a regular basis.
266,2,"Sep 12, 2008","I want to love CTA... and I try to meet it half way, but it lets me down.Chicago makes it easier to travel at later/earlier hours of the day, but they don't make the ride itself very efficient or understandable. Coming from Minnesota, we have a smaller area to work with in the Twin Cities and it is a lot harder to get lost. Plus, there is the whole Minnesota nice that goes along with the drivers. Can't seem to find that here.During the past eight years I have been riding the L and haven't had too many problems. About two years ago I was trying to go North to South on the Red Line. The train was half an hour late, so we froze in the Chicago winter. When we finally got on the train it took us forever to get to our destination. They stopped the train for over half an hour because of construction. This happened to me another time trying to go from Midway to O'Hare. Not the best feeling in the world.Like I said, most of my problem is with the website. They make it easy to find your destination on the map; however, they make the process of getting there more complicated than it should be. I can't count how many times they've told me to take the Metra to Blue Line to a bus and walk when it would have cost less and taken less time to just take the Metra all the way downtown. Then, when you want to take a bus, they give you the intersection, but don't mention which side of the street or the direction that you need. For someone not from the area, it can get confusing.Back to the whole Minnesota nice. Too bad it isn't Midwest nice. It clearly didn't migrate south. Some of the CTA drivers are rude as hell. I was trying to get from Des Plaines to the nearest Target. I waited directly under the bus stop sign. Then the driver pulls up and snaps at me, ""You need to give me a signal or something. There are a lot of buses that stop here."" I said, ""OK..."" What the hell? I'm under the friggin' sign, isn't that enough? Then I pulled the chord to get off and asked which way to walk to the shopping center. She gives me some attitude about ""we ain't there yet.."" That wasn't my question. I had the same woman on the way back home. We were waiting for the Metra to pass, so I walked to the front to be able to see where my stop was. I pulled the chord for the NEXT STOP and she's like, ""This isn't a stop. You could at least wait until we're past the tracks."" What the hell do you say to that? I'm not from here, sorry."

I mean, it seems to fit... people piss and shit in them so why not clean it out as such? I lived briefly in Chicago and thought I was so damn cool for always riding around on these piss trains. My light pink Calvin Klein puffy coat eventually turned brown after a month of riding. Taking the train from Jefferson Park to Damen would ensure I'd at least exit with some dirt under my nails but still, I was true to you. True to you despite the fact that your trains and buses came inconsistently, sometimes one after another, sometimes a 40 minute gap in between. I also hated your outside platforms. WOOD?! How about I just break my neck now to avoid slipping on your wet platform later. I recently headed back to Chicago and we took the ""L"" from O'Hare of Clark/Lake. You can smell the trains from baggage claim. I about puked when I entered and swore I sat in piss. Upon exiting at Clark/Lake, there are helpful signs indicating which way to head for one of the multiple transfer trains. CTA, you need to improve. Where CTA wins kudos: You run 24 hours a day. Way to help the homeless stay warm in the harsh winters!! Cheaper than DC metro. You can buy a monthly pass and it's a flat rate no matter how far you go. Easy to follow bus routes."

It is dirty, often graffiti-ridden, late more than on-time and there are never enough buses on Cubs game days (if you've ever ridden a jam-packed bus with suburban, drunk Cubs fans, you know what I'm talking about).  I am grateful I do not have to rely on a car and for my daily 6:55 AM bus driver on the X80.Yes its money is limited and yes changes are being made.  But it seems too little too late.  For example, if New York, with all its boroughs and one-way streets, can maintain an efficient bus and train system, why can't Chicago?"

Reasonably priced, somewhat fast... the various lines can take you all over the city.  One of the best ways to get to a Cubs or Sox game.CDT...  I'm not sure if this paratransit service is still offered through CTA, or if it was transferred to Pace.  In any case, this is another great service.  While I never used it, my father depended on it to get to work every morning.  The drivers were very nice and polite.The busses...  One of the worst things about the CTA... the crappy service.  CTA busses tend to be very over crowded, always run late (the schedule is a joke), and like to break down because they are old and poorly maintained.  On the other hand, the drivers are overall good people (ok, there are a very small number of assholes, but in 6 years of taking CTA, I've only encountered 2) and do their best.RTA route planner... This service, offered through the CTA web page attempts to give directions.  Its an ok service, but some of the suggested routes suck.

282,2,"Jul 12, 2006","Hailing from LA, I come from a city where public transportation is basically nonexistent.  So Chicago's a nice surprise.  Granted, the CTA can def improve, but in general, it gets the job done.Yes, the buses, especially the 55, 6, and 173 are consistently late here in Hyde Park, but at least they come.  They could come 5 minutes early instead of 25 minutes late, but I'm not complaining too much.  And I do like the ""L"" a lot.  It connects to the Red and Blue lines easily, and I can freely transfer to other lines if need be.  So no, this system isn't nearly as extensive or efficient as NY's, but it gets the job done."
283,3,"Nov 25, 2007","I really want to say four stars because I've had a good experience using the train and the bus, but their inconsistencies really piss me off. I don't even know why they post a bus ""schedule"" online when it is completely unreliable and you could be standing outside in the cold for 30 minutes or more before you see the bus you're trying to catch.In particular the Milwaukee bus I take to and from work is never on time when it's supposed to be, and you just have to take a guess as to when it might be there and go outside and wait. They really need to get it together and figure out a better way to get the buses running.That being said, they are usually clean and I haven't had too many grouchy bus drivers, and I take the blue line to and from O'Hare and that's no problem. It was annoying that when they are working on the slow spots that you have to get off, take a bus to the next station, and then get back on the train... but if in the end it means the train will go quicker, then it will be all worth it, I guess."

I love the occasional crazy person on the train (yes, lady who claims that she was on Diana Ross's high school swim team, I am talking to you!), and the friendly bus drivers (hey, I've never encountered a rude one, and I find that the bus drivers really appreciate a nice ""good morning"" or ""have a nice weekend"".

It cant be that THAT many more people are riding on certain days...My Theory: I think they have some drivers call in sick and just run less trains some days, leaving us, the paying public, to jam onto them.Today it was a MORE than packed day, to the point i barely got on the 2nd Red line train that went by at the Addison stop. I decided to push and squeezed on to that one bc i knew, in one stop i would have to get off...and transfer to the brown, which ::crossed fingers:: wouldn't be as packed. Well the problem wasn't that that it was packed, its that it decided to NOT SHOW....THREE red line trains went by before a brown. Each packed Red dropping off MORE people to squeeze on to Brown train that is coming 1/3 less times. Frustrated i wouldn't get on a Brown....I reluctantly decided to hop back on the Red.BAD IDEA-  the RED decided to run at like 4 mph the whole way...it had hit 8:30...when i needed to be at work.. i was underground and had no reception, so i couldn't call in. I didn't get off  at Monroe/State until almost 9..and then had to walk 10min to work (instead of the around the corner ...if i took the brown)...so here i am, showing up 35min late.  I am pissed....crap!They REALLY need to get their sh*t straight for the morning commutes."
286,5,"Jun 14, 2016","love this rapid transit. trains come often, they are clean, no-one is panhandling oreating, the signage is easy to understand and the attendants are very helpful. surebeats nyc!"
287,3,"Dec 2, 2007","Believe me....there are days where I would give the CTA NO stars! Like the time it took me almost 1.5 hours to get home (only 5 miles-and only 15 minutes by car) and then I ended up having to walk the last half mile and it started to sleet on me on the walk home!!But MOST of the time you can get anywhere in the city within an hour. Whether its 2 miles or 12 miles it still usually takes an hour-I know, it mystifies me too but I've grown to accept it.Again, I repeat-MOST of the time. My husband and I only have one car, so for 5 years I've relied on the CTA to get me to work, doctors appointments, school, and much more.... Although I will acknowledge that it's gotten a little ridiculous with all the ""doomsday"" service cuts threats, the fare hikes, etc. I am still grateful the CTA exists and can get me around the city fairly reliably. I've had close friends who have seen violence on the train, I've witnessed masturbation, defecation and urination and obviously experienced solicitation from homeless people and been subject to funky spills (vomit, anyone?) as well as smells. But what 24-hour service that goes ALL over the LARGE and DIVERSE city wouldn't have some of these issues....I try to cut slack where slack is due!Edit (4/22): Yes, I was one of those stuck underground in the blue-line mess last week. Yes, it sucked. No, I'm not afraid of taking the blue line or subway now. Personally, it was more comical than scary and my train conductor was great with letting us know what was going on and helping to lighten the situation. I still think the CTA needs some significant improvements, but people-it could be MUCH worse."
288,3,"Oct 19, 2009","Background: I used to work in city/transit planning in NYC. The CTA, in my opinion, seems like an eager organization (as far as transit operators go) and does a decent job with their limited resources. They are generally pretty friendly, and they clearly put effort into customer service initiatives like Bus Tracker, the crisp automated announcements, and the hoards of customer service reps when they have service changes. American city dwellers in general *love* to complain that America's metros don't run like their European counterparts, but nobody wants to put their money where their mouth is. Take Paris, a city that is roughly the same size (slightly smaller city, slightly larger metro area). The RATP gets $10 billion a year from the government to operate the rapid transit system, while the CTA gets less than 1/7th of that to work with. So if we'd like to increase CTA's operating budget by 750%, I'm sure we too could have pretty stations, shiny new trains, and new lines being built. (In fact, that would be a great thing!) Or, you could pay $8 for a one-way ticket on London's (semi) privatized Underground. That said, I find riding the quirky 'L' to be kind of awesome, kind of like a low-intensity roller coaster ride with great views. The 'L' needs serious expansion, and misses enormous swaths of the city. The CTA really ought to reconsider its line extensions on the Orange and Red and put those efforts into things like the Circle Line to create better interurban connections. Chicago is too spread out already--development should encourage density in the core, not push it even further out.Oh. The farecard vending machines are horrendous."
289,1,"Apr 9, 2015",Passengers beware - it seems that CTA has allowed the blue line  from  O'Hara to turn into a homeless shelter.  This morning @ around 8 am there were  at least 8 homeless men sleeping under blankets in one car.  No effort was made to remove them - Unsafe!!
290,2,"Jun 5, 2009","Though this is the only source of transporation that gets me around Chicago, it is an unreliable and expensive method transporation that is simply unpleasant. CTA trains called the ""L"" are expensive to ride. It costs $2 to ride the bus and $2.25 to ride the train. It is also unreliable in that you never really know when the bus or train is going to arrive. There is a set schedule for arrival times, but the trains never really seem to follow it. The trains are consistently experiencing delays. Many times I have been sitting on the train and the conductor comes on the intercom to once again apologize for the inconvenience and notify us that the train is experiencing technical difficulties. I understand if there are temporary difficulties, but difficulties almost everyday is unacceptable. I sit in the unmoving stopped train car for 10 minutes knowing that this will happen again tomorrow. The buses on the other hand are much more reliable time wise. Other than cost and reliability, the ""L"" is very dirty. The tunnel at Jackson connecting the Red and Blue line smells like urine. They are constantly using chlorine to wash the tunnel floors, but even chlorine cannot cover the unbearable stench. Whenever I have to make the trek across the tunnel I hold my breath walking as fast as I can. Also some of the north side train stops have very little standing room. It is quite scary waiting for the train at those stops, because it seems so easy to fall right into the tracks. Riding the ""L"" is an unpleasant experience and if I were a tourist riding the ""L"" I would have a bad image of Chicago. The CTA really needs to revamp the entire system. But at the end the ""L"" gets me places .... unreliably, making a huge dent in my wallet, and making me want to spray the entire underground system with Lysol and Febreze. Interesting Note - Enjoy the multitalents of the various acts scattered across the different train stations. The Jackson Red line and Blue line stops offers quality entertainment while waiting for the train that never seems to come."
291,5,"Mar 16, 2012","Visiting Chicago for the first time in June of 2010 I had very high expectation for riding the EL trains in Chicago. After being there a week, I love every single moment I spent riding the EL trains and the buses to get to other parts of the city. Love the passing by the tall skyscrapers in downtown, riding across the river, and checking out my surroundings of the whole city. It was efficient to ride the Blue and red line trains to Lincoln Park and Chinatown at night. Love that it ran under a 24 hour service on weekends. The bus were a adventure and like that it came on time and didn't have to wait too long for one at all. I like the fact that inserting the fare card inside the fare box was very convenient and I just fell in love with riding it everywhere. My favorite part was hearing the announcer telling passenger what was the next stop and told what station to get off to transfer to different parts of the city. I got myself a week pass and it was definitely a bargain rather then driving into the city and dealing with the insane traffic, overpriced parking rates, and running the risk of being bankrupt by the end of my vacation. Keep it up CTA!!"
294,1,"Jun 19, 2010","Planes, trains and automobiles... Well minus the planesThe CTA trains and stations are disgusting. Sometimes they smell so bad I have to switch cars at the next station. Not uncommon to find puke on seats and the floor. I once got on with flip-flops and I have no idea what I had my feet in but they were sticking to the ground like glue for the next 30 minutes. I once saw two men smoking on the train like we were back in the 1930's.The buses are crap. Yes you do feel a little safer on them because they have cameras but they are never on time or coordinated. My biggest pet peeve is say you are waiting for a 151 and of course it comes late and then all of a sudden two show up at the same time. Errr!The highest sales tax in the country certainly is not helping public transportation."
295,4,"Jan 9, 2011","I am not a big fan of public transport (I know I am a closet suburbanite hehe), but I have been very impressed by the CTA lately.I never seem to wait more than 10 minutes for a bus/train and it also looks like the Addison 152(?) bus has slightly later running times than in the past.  I am also very fortunate to live within 50 feet of a bus stop and a few blocks from the nearest L station (Addison Brown Line) which came in handy when I recently lost my car to a dead motor and needed to get around.The CTA isn't the greatest, but I'm glad it's here."
296,2,"Nov 29, 2007","CTA, how I hate you so!You never run on time, your bus drivers are rude and obnoxious. I had one driver on the Pulaski who sat at a stop at Diversey and Pulaski for TEN minutes, I kid you not to wait for the Diversey bus to drop off passengers.  When I informed the driver that I have a Metra train to catch at Fullerton, he told me that I should have left earlier.  I told him to go eff himself. Oh yes, sometimes I think the drivers think it's funny to speed away at the last second when you are running to catch the bus and then you have to wait another 20 minutes for the NEXT one!I hate that you have no bus service on Addison #152 after 10 pm on weeknights and 8:30 on weekends. Kind of defeats the purpose of having mass transit, especially since Addison goes through Wrigleyville where all the bars are and the drunks could use a safe ride home. You must be in cahoots with the cab companies on that one!Your trains are dirty and smelly (yes I'm looking at YOU Red Line, the toilet on wheels!) and are in serious need of repair. They also never run on time and waiting in the stations, especially late at night is always a scary adventure!By the way CTA, how is it that you are always out of money and threatening cuts in service, yet can afford to build a swanky new El station at the Addison Brown Line?You are the reason I thank my lucky stars every day that I own a car!**EDIT**You get one more star because you didn't make me wait 20 minutes out in the cold for the Addison #152 bus when I dropped off my car to be repaired, but no more because you still won't give transfers on cash fares!"
297,1,"Dec 16, 2014","It's convenience as opposed to quality. Bums on the train laying over three seats, piss and vomit on the floor, delayed service not reflected accurately in displayed arrival times. Take a f*cking Uber. Seriously. It's trash and pay the extra few dollars to get you home safe without needing a vitamin booster or a tetanus shot. Just YouTube the Chicago red line if you need proof."
298,1,"Dec 10, 2006","The pink line sucks!!   It doesn't come more frequently than any other trains and I've NEVER been on it when it hasn't been delayed or stopped on the tracks for at least 5 minutes.  It's so aggravating to leave on time for work and then be 20-30 minutes late because of the pink line stopping for no reason.  I shouldn't have to allow a half hour for a train ride that is only 3 stops!  And the waiting is just as bad as it was with the blue line because you have to wait for the orange and purple lines to come through first!  And in the winter I would rather wait in the nice, warm underground blue line stop than the freezing platforms of the pink line.  I hope they do away with it soon!"
299,3,"Sep 27, 2005","Honestly, if I had a car I would NEVER ride the CTA!  Its such a pain in the butt!  Nothing ever comes on time and if it does there's always a delay of some sort, not to mention the enormous amounts of people who ride it, normal and creepy!  The trains are a huge pain if you live out of the loop because about the only place you can change to go from one side of the city to the other is the loop and that adds a good 15-30 minutes to your ride.  The buses are convenient at times if you can find the right one going in the right direction at the right timeHOWEVER, there are a lot of advantages, it is pretty cheap to ride unlimited and I have to say its extremely easy to understand.. plus it saves the hassle of having to designate a driver for a night out and its WAY cheaper than a cab!  Not all the lines run at all times of the night.Check www.transitchicago.com and go to Trip Planner, its an awesome way to know exactly which bus or train to take for your time and destination!"
300,3,"May 21, 2007","All you people dogging the CTA should really get out more.Our system is actually better than most of the others out there and actually goes to useful places (unlike LA's subway to nowhere).Yes, it's gotten worse in the last few years (worse than it even was when I last lived in Chicago in 1999) but the system still runs and generally gets you to where you are going in a reasonable amount of time.I've never heard of a train flipping over in my 29 years in Chicago - a few have run off the rails or hung suspended in air yes, but that just gives the ride a spirit of adventure. I'll also agree that something has to be done about the Blue - O'Hare line. This review is not about just the Blue line however and as a whole the system operates, even if just barely. At least it's a real system - not like the ""trollies"" out here in San Diego.(PS - How appropriate that the CTA is my 300th review. I couldn't even find something local to review. Oh well, I guess a part of me will always be in Chicago.)"
301,2,"Feb 6, 2008","you only get 2 stars because you exist - i grew up in an area with no public transit.  where to begin?  Addison bus is so unreliable i'd actually rather drive the Edens, brown line runs slower than i can walk, but my favorite is year-long el stop closings to lengthen platforms.  missions to the moon have been executed in less time.  anyone enamored with the CTA has not been to DC... it's like riding the Disneyland monorail there."
302,1,"Jan 10, 2009","ok...I dont think i have express my opinion enough on yelp yet.But, here it goes...CTA you SUCK!!!Seriously, do i have to wait 1+ hrs for the darn southbound 9 ashland bus. I totally feel sorry for the bus driver who heard smack, from every passenger who he ended picking up from Addison to Chicago Ave.66 Chicago Ave you are no better.This is a poor mans form of cheep transportation, I'm a poor man. But, Hell!! can you help me out. For me time is money getting to work late doesn't help.I have quit using crappy CTA services do to lack of organization, cooperation and intelligence.Yeah...I was the one, after that Sox game, who pissed on the green line platform you darn right you deserved it.One last thing CTA...your MA'MA!!!See now you gots me all mad"
303,2,"Jan 6, 2009","Taking the el while living in Chicago was infrequently pleasant.  To start, many of the stations are above ground (giving rise to the nickname, shortened from ""elevated""), which gave you freezing winter winds and summer sweat stains waiting for the train to come.  The timing was unreliable; it always took longer than expected (or quoted on their website).Their ""improvements"" can drive you crazy.  They shut down major stations for weekends or full months at a time - the red line downtown northbound was closed many weekends, which you don't know until you get in the station.  The blue line out to O'Hare has closed two stations during the weekend for the longest time, so with luggage you need to get out, take a shuttle bus for two stops, then get back on (why not just shuttle the whole last four stops?)  I would love to give just one star but you need public transportation.  It's just one of the worst in America.  It's worse than any European system I've been on.  Heck even Delhi has a much better system than Chicago - imagine that!"
304,2,"Jan 23, 2013",Why is it that some CTA bus drivers seem to hit the brakes hard and some are mindful of the passengers who are standing??!Is it the driver or the bus?
305,3,"Feb 11, 2008","The CTA has their moments of greatness, but they love to provide anger and frustration.  Nine out of ten times I have an enjoyable experience.  There is always the time where I'm in a hurry somewhere or I just want to get home and something that makes no sense will occur.  I've been on buses where the driver claims that the route isn't running the whole way and he will make everyone leave the bus, leaving people bewildered.  I've had a bus breakdown on the middle of Lake Shore.  I've seen crazies doing crazy things.  I guess overall the CTA gets the job done, although there are things that could be done to improve service."

309,4,"Oct 1, 2008","As I was rushing to get home last night to walk the dogs so I could turn around and head back South, I was reminded just how lucky I am to live in this wonderful city. Chicago is everything that I love: loud, busy, beautiful, exciting, edgy, crazy, delicious, hot, cold, rainy, humid, dry, and most importantly, walkable and convenient as hell. The CTA, with all of her flaws and faults, is a huge part of what makes this such a great town.Sure, she has her issues. She's late, can't stick to a schedule, crowded and sometimes slow. She raises her rates without improving service, and lord knows her drivers can be surly as hell. She's always there for us, though, no matter what the weather, she's there. El or bus, she never leaves us stranded. Well not always, but you get the point.I missed my Metra train yesterday, and needed to get home quickly so I hopped on the Blue line and transferred to the Purple line, shot home, got back on the Purple line and transferred to the Red line. Maybe the gods were looking out for me, but I didn't have to wait too long and the trains (minus the Red line) really weren't that crowded. Sure, the guy sitting next to me on the Purple line had 13 cloves of raw garlic for lunch, and fell asleep on my shoulder, thus breathing his vampire-repellent breath directly on me, but, isn't that what makes this city beautiful? I'm sure she'll piss me off soon, but, I heart you CTA, from the bottom of my fickle heart, I really do."
310,3,"May 4, 2010","Dear Chicago Transit Authority,Your buses are remarkably clean, frequent and on time. Your trains, though reliable, are kinda dingy inside. Overall? Ok. Just do one thing for me please:TAKE CREDIT CARDS!!!!!!!! I know I'm ""spoiled"" in NYC with that option, but seriously! It's a pain in the ass to be scrounging for exactly $2.25! Most people don't carry cash anymore! Get with it!!"
311,4,"Feb 2, 2009","I love the CTA and all public transportation for that matter.  What I don't love though is how most public transportation in the United States pales in comparison to urban areas across the pond.Why can't the CTA add a circle train line?  One that goes from University of Chicago to Western Ave, shoots up Western till the Brown Line and then cuts back to the lake and hits the Red at like Bryn Mawr?  You know how awesome that would be?  Go to Berlin and comapre their U-Bahn and S-Bahn to the antiquated CTA and you will drool with envy.  Imagine being able to leave Rogers Park and be at O'Hare in 30 minutes.  If the Circle Train line existed you could.  It would alleviate the need to ride on one of the East West bus lines during G R I D L O C K rush hour traffic and get you from the Red line to the blue without having to go all the way downtown.Aside from my vexation due to not having a Circle Line I really do heart the CTA.  Based on what it does offer it is way convenient (Why aren't the trains on bus tracker?) , affordable (even with the fare increase it still beats car payments, car insurance, oil changes, parking, gas, and sanity from driving in Chicago), reliable (many 247 buses) and the 'inspiration' for one of the greatest bands of all time (Chicago - originally named Chicago Transit Authority).CTA, I heart you - just add a circle line and I'll give you five stars!"
312,3,"Nov 6, 2012","I mean what can you say about Public Transportation...I wish they hadn't changed to all digital and kept the green signs in the window because it made it easier to know which train was yours.Especially, if you have problem seeing!"
313,4,"Jan 3, 2014","They have heating lamps on the platform while you wait for the train, which is nice during the recent blizzard and cold blast of negative temperatures.  The green line was nice and easy to take out west to bars and restaurants without any issues."
314,4,"Nov 14, 2006","I mostly like the CTA.  I've found that, by and large, it works well for me.  I have a plan down so that I can get up, get ready and be at the bus stop for no more than three to five minutes in the morning on my way to the gym.  Coming back from the gym is equally predictable.  So is the trip the the Blue Line, for my commute to work.  I have a little more trouble coming home at night, as that's when I tend to veer from the plan.  Last night, I waited from approx. 6:40 PM to 7:35 PM for a bus, when heading east bound on North Avenue.  But, the hour wait is few and far between.It seems to me that during normal conditions (read: regular commutes in acceptable weather) the CTA is great.  When the weather starts to suck or you're going against the grain during a commute, or at an off time, it can be tough.  While not perfect, it still beats the crap out of buying a car, buying insurance and exerting the effort to protect that investment.   On the positive side, it's not illegal to have a couple of brews before getting on the bus.   Pfhew!"
315,4,"Jan 10, 2007","CTA is the only American transit agency that I would even dream of stamping with four hard-earned stars. Public transportation in the U.S. is an embarrassing joke, but CTA attempts to break that mold. Often, it succeeds, with plenty of mishaps along the way. After six months of using CTA's old but reliable system, I was convinced that I didn't need a car in Chicago. CTA saved me enough money to afford moving to the West Coast. There's some irony there, because the transit I deal with now (San Francisco's MUNI) is easily one of the WORST systems in the U.S., and the butt of tourist jokes around the world."
316,3,"Aug 6, 2008","I can't really take any stars away, because this was only one instance, but I would like to share this with you all...On Friday I decided to take the #36 Broadway bus home after work because I stopped at a store close to it.  Well I waited 30 freakin minutes for the most crowded packed bus ever just to pass me up.  Well, since I do love the CTA I decided just to stick it out and wait for another one...15 minutes later another one shows up, slightly less packed, but still packed.  Luckily this one stopped and I squished myself on.  UGH!  Not what I wanted to deal with on a Friday...."

I'm being totally serious when I say that almost every time I leave my apartment to get the bus, there is a bus pulling up (as well as others).My bf and his friends think it's ridiculous how I can be anywhere and I never have to wait (ok, maybe not never...but barely).  I just have love for the CTA.I have had about a half dozen busses break down on me on my way to work, but surprisingly there is always a bus right there to pick us up.

He doesn't deserve the 6 figures he is making.  I have lived in London, been to Hong Kong and never had as many problems as I do here. I also have a problem with people who ride the CTA and do not respect the PRIORITY SEATING!

322,3,"Nov 17, 2007","Since I know a lot of good, dedicated people who work here, and am in the transit business myself, I can't knock the CTA. If you had no money and lived in a shack, would appreciate it if people came to your house and bitched at you because you aren't living in a mansion? Money issues aside minus two stars for bus bunching, mayoral meddling, and the late ""great"" Frank Kruesi, and the suspicion I have that the CTA cares more about tourists and suburbanites than regular folk who need the system (see differing attention given to trains vs buses). But the trains are pretty good, and the system is always there when you need it...well, at least until January."
323,4,"Sep 23, 2008","This is a very convenient, efficient transportation system. The station agents are nice and helpful, the trains and buses seem relatively clean.

326,3,"May 12, 2009","You know, I'm just going to go straight down the middle and say that the CTA is A-OK.  I've traveled to a bunch of cities, both domestically and abroad, and I can tell you that the CTA system (El and buses) are pretty darned good.  Sure, a bunch of times some bus lines suck or the El can't run on time, but also a good number of other times, everything works out just fine.  I think that since we're dealing with a psuedo-government agency and one that is, has been, and will be underfunded, the fact that things run on time and you usually have relatively considerate employees (try having their job and see if YOU can even muster a smile), we have to give the CTA some props for being a decent and massive organization."
327,3,"Apr 3, 2010","I was ready to write a bad review and rip CTA to shreds, but this time I cannot do so since they redeemed themselves in this particular situation.In hopes of getting more work done at the office, I left my place about half an hour early.  To hasten my arrival downtown, I planned to hop on either of the two bus lines that roll by my corner.  When a bus arrived, I got on and placed my transit card into the machine.  The card popped out through the back and the display indicated it as invalid.  The driver tried the card again with the same result.  He simply told me that my card was not good.  I knew this couldn't be the case since I monitor the expiration dates of my fares and this one was not slated to go bad until 4/18.  (Note: Although the machine prints the expiration date on the back of the card upon activation, this one, as my luck would have it, was printed over the use by date already on the card and made the exp. date almost unreadable.)  He didn't seem willing to let me stay on without paying in an alternative manner and I wasn't about to pull out my wallet (for the record I did have sufficient cash and money loaded on a Chicago card), so I just got off at the stop on the next block.  Needless to say, I was irritated and more than slightly embarrassed as the bus sped onto outer LSD without me.  A few moments later, a bus for my regular line pulled up.  I was so sure that my card would work properly.  Nope.  The card again read as invalid on this bus' reader.  This time the driver nicely allowed me to stay on without paying another way.  I was so thankful for his mercy on me.  While on this bus, I called the 800 number listed on the back of the crappy fare card.  Surprisingly my wait time to speak to a representative was decent.  No elevator music passed through my eardrums.  After hearing my spiel, the rep simply told me to come to CTA headquarters for a replacement.After work, I walked all the way to 567 Lake.  When I got there, I couldn't get over the spanking new and clean appearance of the building.  There's even an artsy, metal bull in the lobby.  This must be where the funds go - not to the trains, buses and miles of train tracks.  Luckily I got there at a good time since there were two people being assisted and one woman ahead of me.  Again, my wait time was not that long.  When I finally got to the window, the line was growing out the door.  Once I got to the front, I only told a brief version of my troubles, turned in my defective pass and filled out a simple form.  Moments later, the clerk gave me a brand new 30 day pass.  I was excited as this was unexpected.  I only had 16 or so days left on my crap one, so I thought they would give me a combo of weekly and day passes to make up for the owed 16 days.  In the end, I really couldn't have faulted the first driver for not allowing me to stay on without paying since he couldn't read the expiration date.  Thanks for making my trek to 567 Lake worth the walk!  Maybe now CTA can do something about the chicken bones under the train seats or people taking leaks (yes I witnessed that tonight) on the El stairs."
328,4,"Feb 26, 2012","The CTA. It makes living in the city sans a car possible. Well, the PACE bus and Metra trains, and havig two airports help too. They have smartphone apps to help you plan and track your travel and have new train cars in the works that are awesome. Plus, the X-mas Santa train is always refreshing to see during the holidays. If the state would just couch up some more funding to increase the awesomeness of the CTA, that would be awesome."

Yes, I've heard all about the CTA hang ups, and I even experienced some of it for myself while visiting there for a month - but you know what? I'd deal with all of that any day the week as long as it meant not having to rely on my car all the freaking time. In Florida, you drive EVERYWHERE, there is no option. If you have no car you suffer, plain and simple.Part of the reason I'm consider relocating to Chicago, (besides the fact that I love the city), is because I'm tired of having no option. Plus, I love riding trains, taking in the scenery, and people watching.Of course this may turn out to be a different story should I actually live there, but as a visitor, I enjoyed my experience with CTA.P.S. One star off because some of the CTA trains do come off as unkept and smell. I can only imagine the germs lying beneath. *shudders*"

The building has a cool design and there are great places to eat and drink in the area.  If people have questions regarding their CTA bus card, they can go directly to the second floor and by pass security."
334,5,"May 23, 2011","CTA is user friendly once you get the hang of it all.  It was quite a savings going public transportation and not dealing with driving and parking....big cities are crazy to drive in.The only negative experience I had was.................only transferring to the Red line going towards 95th which you really need to be careful.  A man was trying to get my attention...asking my how to get to the airport, and probably he was really wanting to rob me.  I'm from the big city, so you learn not to look or talk to people and watch your belongings.The 1 day; 3 day, 7 day passes are a great deal bc you don't need to concern yourself with time limits, or transfers.  it works 24 hours from the time you actually use it and the expiration time and date is on the back of the ticket.Most bus drivers and CTA workers at the stations were all helpful and nice.  There were some bus drivers who seem grumpy, but were willing to assist you.It was great that the CTA public transit system is frequent and covers so many areas.  They can update and modernize their buses, ""L"" trains and stations.  Also, clean up all the debris along the ""L' trains stations"
335,2,"Aug 13, 2008","Can't say I see evidence of a brain behind this stuff. Trains never follow their schedules, things like the CTA trip planner are always off. And buses are just never on time, ever. The smallest, simplest courtesy they could provide is a tiny little electronic display at L stops and major bus stops that would tell you which stop the thing you're waiting for is at. I just hate the feeling of waiting and waiting (and it's happened before that trains have never came, ie canceled service).The whole bus system is archaic and shitily designed. There should be bus waiting zones, so you pay to enter the waiting zone, then when the bus comes you can just get right on (and we avoid the line of 10 people stopping one after the other to find 2 bucks in their wallet). There should also be about 25% as many stops as there are. Buses stop every block because people are too fuckin fat to walk more than a block (wonder where that cheetos smell comes from?), and yes, this often costs an extra traffic light or two every couple of stops, and probably 20 minutes on an hour-long bus trip.Another backwards thing about the CTA is the complete lack of integration with the Metra. Most other cities have easy and convenient transfer points.The second star was for the fact that there is decent 24 hr coverage and it is cheap (w/ the chicago card)."
336,2,"Nov 1, 2008","I found CTA to be better priced than SEPTA (Philadelphia). But, the trains just take too long to get anywhere. Especially if you are using it for O'Hare airport. It can take a while before you get downtown.there are always a bunch of shady characters on the train. Someone is always doing some ""survey"" and crap like that. But, overall it was better quality than comparable services in other cities of the country."

I don't appreciate that the last boss, Huberman, ran it further into the ground and got rewarded with a totally undeserved promotion to be the head of CPS.  But still I use it because it means I don't have to drive."

Another train comes in, and it loads and leaves with me still trapped in the first train. Then I get off at Logan to catch the bus, I should have a transfer. My card says insufficient fair so the driver makes me pay the full $2.25 cash - well , unless i want to go back to the station, reload my card, and wait for the next bus (6583)."

341,4,"Sep 15, 2006","I empathize with those that have posted complaints and/or negative remarks, and yet I agree with those who are complimentary to the CTA. Here's the deal: I've lived in this lovely city for over fifteen years. I moved here straight from Dallas, Tx. In other words, I drove for life. What you cannot argue against (well I guess you could, to the point of infinity) is that the CTA still provides Chicago with one of the best public transportation systems in the US. No, it's not NY's rail system, and it never will be unless a billionaire decides to plunk down hundreds of millions of dollars down to build new lines. But that's not the point. It is a rare case that I cannot figure out a way to get to where I'm going via train or bus. I use either the 7-day pass or the 30-day pass, both of which completely negate the ""but it's [x] amount of dollars to use it!"". Yes, the money could be managed better - but if YOU think you can fix the System that *is* the City of Chicago, good luck. If you haven't been in the political machine here for more than ten years, you're not going to make a dent. Here's what I *don't* pay for by using the CTA:gascar insurancetime spent looking for parkingtickets I will note that I have tried owning/using a car twice, each time for more than a couple months, and saw my costs rise in terms of cash flow (out), time and energy wasted. I've lived on the west side, and now live on the north side. I've had to get to everywhere from Midway to OHare to literally hundreds of places in-between. The CTA, with all its faults, still exists, still functions, and still gets me to where I need to go for an average of $80 or less a month. Without it, I can't get to work, I would have a harder time meeting friends, and I would have seen less of the city. BTW - if you think the system was built as a joke, you really don't f**king know your Chicago history. You also haven't paid attention to what the car companies did in the West and South - they bought up the electric and non-electric rails systems and tore them up in order to sell buses they made to whatever city they wanted to ""compete"" for in the public transportation sector. It's in our history books, its documented in court proceedings and investigations, and it's why we don't have more cities with better public transportation systems. So no, Chicago's system wasn't set up as a joke, but as a means of getting people to where they wanted to be to where they were needed (from home to downtown). Wake up."
342,5,"May 10, 2011","We live in a tiny town in the south so we have very limited experience with public transportation. In Chicago, we stayed in the Rosemont area and took the train into town.Staring at the ticket machine for a very long time probably doesn't make us look like world travelers but it did attract the attention of the employees there who were incredibly nice & helpful. They took us through the steps to get our ticket, told us about how long it would take to get to downtown and set us on our way. Train ride was very pleasant. Stations were conveniently located near where we wanted to go. People were friendly.Grateful for the kindness of the staff there. Thank you."
345,4,"Jun 22, 2009","At the risk of sounding like a total crackpot, I'm in love with the CTA.  To put some perspective on this, I come from a city that has no practical public transit system (Houston, TX).  So, when I travel to other cities with decent public transit options, I simply fall under a powerful spell.  While the spell is potent, it is not complete.  Most of the buses are relatively clean but I'd wash hands at the first chance.  Most of the elevated lines are noisy inside the train, standing outside underneath on the street, or on the platform.  The subway stations are dirty and noisy - I wouldn't eat off the floor and I'd pause before picking up anything that fell on the ground.  ""Do I really need that?"" would be my question.  All of it is pretty old and gritty except for the Brown and Green lines.  Everyone uses the system to get around.But, all a great bargain at $2.25 for a full-priced ride.  I cashed in further by buying a 3-day pass for $14 at the airport.  A great value to reacquaint myself with Chicago since my last visit was about 12 years ago.  They have 1-day, 7-day, and 30-day passes, too.On a whirlwind bromance with Chicago over a long weekend, I saw/did the following items during my 2.5 days with an assist from the CTA's mix of buses, subway, and elevated trains:* Took the Blue line from O'Hare into the city to the hotel.* Took the Brown line to the Paulina station for lunch at Pho's Hot and Spicy Thai.* Hitched a ride on the 152 Addison bus afterwards and jumped off in front of Wrigley Field while the Cubs home stand was going on.* Viewed the Art Institute, Millennium Park, and the Cloud Gate sculpture (aka the Bean).* Took the 12 Roosevelt bus to University of Illinois-Chicago to Jim's Original Hot Dog where I learned to eat off an outside ledge like the locals.* Picked up a free map with all of the bus lines at the Chicago Waterworks Visitor Center.  (You can also get one at the Chicago Cultural Center.)* Checked out the Buckminster Fuller and Alexander Calder exhibits at the Museum of Contemporary Art.* Rode the 151 Sheridan through Lincoln Park to the Halsted terminus.* Rode the Red line north to Loyola station then the 155 bus along Devon Avenue for an Indian lunch at Viceroy.* Met fellow awesome Yelper, Jenny H, at the Diversey Brown line station then we took the 76 Diversey bus to Hot Doug's http://www.yelp.com/biz/hot-dougs-chicago on Saturday.  We were first in line at 10 AM.* Took the Green line out to Oak Park to check out the Unity Temple, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright.  http://www.yelp.com/biz/unity-temple-unitarian-universalist-congregation-oak-park* Ended up by mistake at the Garfield station when I hopped on the wrong bus and the driver didn't notice I was still on his bus as he headed towards the garage on the south side.  Luckily, we spotted the error in time for him to pull off the freeway to make an impromptu stop outside this rail station for my repatriation back to the city.  (Lesson learned:  Do not be the last passenger on a route.  Or, be sure to make a lot of noise.  So much for blending in.)While my Chicago Yelp colleagues may have a love-hate relationship with the CTA, I'm a fan.  It got me around the city and allowed me to see a wonderful variety of neighborhoods (some pretty, some not) and people (some pretty, some not, some simply stunning).  Now, I'm not just a fan of the CTA, I'm a fan of the city of Chicago."

Today's episode of ""Raising The Bar of Incompetence/Lowering The Depths Of Helpfulness"" played out as follows:My CTA card was stolen.  I called customer 'service' to find out what to do.  I found out that I should go online and ""replace"" the card and opt to pick a new one up the next day.  *I* should do this.  Fine.  I went online.  Placed a 'replace' order, noted the $5 fee for doing so, scowled & went to bed.  I woke up this morning, got ready for work, caught the bus, paid $2.25, got off the bus, caught a train, paid $2.25, transferred train and entered the gleaming city that is CTA headquarters.  Seriously, it's Ozian in its municipal opulence.  By all the gltiz of the place, I could tell the CTA is hurting for funds.I went up the stairs, waited in line and, finally, approached the window for my new card.  ""Hold.""  Wait.  What?  ""You need to see the customer service gentleman around the corner.  I can't help you.""  Wait.  What?  Disgruntled, but hopeful, I complied and made my way to the reception area.  I told the man behind the desk of my plight.  ""Uhma, I cain't help you.""  Wait.  What? ""You went online and did yo' own card.  I cain't override that.""  Wait.  What?  ""You will get your new card in three or four days.  You shulda never done that.  You shulda came in here and did it for free.  Why didn't you do that?

Threats may or may not have been made.  A phone may or may not have been whupped upside someone's head.  It's all unclear.  And, isn't that all in the past (if something happened, that is)?  Rather than explain to me why following customer service instructions lead me to this dark fate in the first place and it should be someone's job to fix the f up...Rather than rationalize to me why it takes 3 or 4 days for me to pick something up I could have already had in my hands 30 minutes ago and that is processed four blocks from where we stand...Rather than figuring out that giving the customer the ability to place a *hold* on his card in order to freeze the card until the customer can speak to a competent service agent & rectify the situation...Rather than all of this (and more), I was out $30, an hour of my time and a broken nail (from the phone upside the head whuppin').  All I had was a further reason to loathe the CTA.I...I...despise the CTA so...so...much....I have...""Mrs. White"" levels of hate flame on...both..sides of my...my..face.  Everyday is a struggle of late buses, interrupted train service & terrible customer 'service.'  The CTA, from its head management to the legion of rail 'workers' who lounge about 5 at a time ogling women and doing little other than reaping the benefits of collective bargaining, is an exercise in failure.

348,2,"Feb 19, 2008","I suppose I knew it would come to this: the CTA.  Throughout history, epic tales have been written about great antagonists.  Superman v. Lex Luthor.  Batman v. The Joker.  Johnny T. v. the CTA.  Yes, the CTA is my arch enemy and one day I will destroy it.  In the years I have been riding the CTA, I have come to terms with an 11 minute drive taking 40.  I have found some peace with the fact that running for a bus means the driver WILL pull off that much quicker in an attempt to leave you behind.  I try to remain calm as I walked the #22 route from Andersonville to Lincoln Park and NEVER.SAW.ONE.BUS!  The same thing happened as I walked from Lincoln Park to the Loop.  I almost crapped my pants when I saw two thugs beat up a Chad whose only fault was having a mouthy Trixie as a girlfriend (said gf was the reason Chad got popped).  I felt for the young woman who was pick pocketed IN FRONT OF THE CPD and nothing was done (Roosevelt stop, Red Line).  I channel my inner chi as I stand in sub-zero temperatures, without cover, as 30 mph winds attempt to cut me to my very soul waiting for a bus that is 35 minutes late.  I put a smile in my voice when dealing with CTA customer service reps who would care less about giving you the right information or answering the phone in a timely manner.  I very nearly lose my isht when I see Ron Huberman on the news talking about an organization he is so woefully ill-equipped to run (gotta love Chicago patronage; the dude was a BEAT COP!  He didn't even have so much as a CTA card before King Daley gave him the CTA gig!).  But I stay calm because I look at this as my training.  Just as the Bride suffered under the cruel tutelage of of Pai Mei, so must I suffer and train under the evil of Ron Huberman and the CTA.  Only then will I have the skills necessary to vanquish my enemy.  You see, this is about more than me and the CTA.  Bring on the House of Blue Leaves and the Crazy 88.  No problem.  I'll handle it.

355,4,"Dec 1, 2009","The CTA gets a bad rap, methinks. For those of you weighing the benefits of taking mass transit vs. driving, consider this.   -  You get where you want to go probably a little slower - unless you're on the train when it's snowing. Snow ain't no match for steel on steel. Traffic on the roads = standstill.  -  So you've gotten there 10 minutes later than your driving counterparts, but guess what? You hop off the train or bus and you're there. Hey man, have fun driving around looking for a parking space for your car for 20 minutes before having to pay for parking. I'm already on my second beer and I just gave away your seat.  -  Oh, you can't drink because you've gotta drive home? Ha! Night owl buses and trains rule. And late night, they're hilarious. But sometimes sketchy. Which is sometimes hilarious.   -  Yeah, sometimes the tracks get re-routed and you've gotta re-plan for stuff. Good thing you've got that invincible car that NEVER goes on the blink and needs to be repaired which NEVER costs you hundreds of extra dollars.Look, I've ridden public transit in many American cities, and Chicago has it good. Is it going to be as convenient as the NYC subways? Not quite. But in terms of ease of use and cleanliness, the CTA is pretty darn good. As far as trains (or buses) being dirty, I'm not sure what lines you're riding (I'm a regular on Brown-Red-Orange-Blue, in that order), but they're not bad. Gross things happen. You live in a city. It'll be okay, just watch what you sit in. I'm car-free for the first time in my adult life, and I love it."
356,3,"Feb 11, 2017","The good: Thanks to the CTA, getting around Chicago without a car is not only possible, it is cheaper than using a car and paying for gas, parking, insurance and repairs. With connecting buses and trains all over the city, planning a trip is simple and quick. Actually taking that trip, however, is another story.The bad: While I have come across many kind, intelligent and helpful CTA drivers, there are also those bad apples who make a civilized person question the collective morality of humanity itself. Sadly, those bad apples are becoming more and more prevalent, while the decent human beings are being shoved out of the way. So that kindly bus driver who took the extra time to check and make sure that the person in the wheelchair was strapped in, comfortable and happy? Sadly, she is becoming a rarity among drivers, while the basic decency that we all should expect becomes such an uncommon thing that we feel the need to applaud such humanity when we come across it.  Just in the last week:A driver passed up  group of people, who then began running after the bus and shouting for him to stop. Not only did he fail to stop, he saw them standing there, saw them waving their arms, heard them shouting (we all did) and he just kept on driving without any expression on his face. Another driver was quite rude to, and short with, an older woman using a walker. He kept huffing and puffing as she tried to get on the bus, and then, in a frustrated and impatient snit, gruffly told her to hurry up. Then, he began driving away even before she was able to sit down, to the point where she began to wobble a bit as if she were going to fall. Luckily she was not injured, but the next time, a disabled person might not be so lucky. The above-mentioned bus driver is the same person who shouted at a man who tried to get off the bus in the back. The man pulled the ""stop request cord"" and the bus did stop - but only to pick up other passengers. The driver never opened the back door. So when he began driving again without letting the man off, the man had to shout to be let out. The driver then became angry and shouted at the man to hurry up, telling him that he should have paid attention, which is ironic, because the man did pay attention; it was the driver who did not. Back door issues seem to be happening more and more as drivers fail to acknowledge the ""stop requested"" notification when someone wants to get off. In another situation, a man pulled the cord to request a stop. The driver stopped, but only to let other people on. He then took off without letting the man off the bus. The man, who was attempting to get out the back door because the front of the bus was crowded with baggage and a wheelchair, shouted for the driver to let him out, which of course did not happen. He ended up having to run to the front of the bus and demand to be let off. The driver finally let him off, after saying nothing, admitting nothing, and staring with an almost puzzled expression at the man, as if the driver could not comprehend what the man was saying, doing or requesting. This lack of comprehension makes me wonder if the CTA hires just anyone who walks through their door, regardless of intelligence or cognitive ability. And then there was yet another situation where the driver failed to let someone out the back door. Again, the front was pretty full so for people sitting in the back, using the back door is the best option. A woman pulled the ""stop request"" cord to be let out at the next stop. The driver slowed down just a bit as if he was going to stop, but he was clearly only doing so to let people on the bus. When he realized they did not want to get on, he just kept going. The woman shouted for him to stop and he did not. So, the woman pulled the cord again for him to stop at the next bus stop. He stopped, let other people on, and did not let her out the back door. He then took off, and the woman shouted even louder at him to STOP. Everyone on the bus looked confused, and other people began questioning what his problem was, that this woman has now tried twice to get off the bus and twice this driver failed to let her off. Finally, because of the commotion, the driver stopped and let the woman off, as well as a few other frustrated passengers. The driver had absolutely no expression on his face for the entire time, though I thought I could make out a smug little grin. Maybe I just imagined it. Also, the change to cloth seats, from the plastic variety, was a pretty bad idea. First of all, it is obvious when plastic is wet, while it isn't always obvious when cloth is wet. I'm sure you get where I'm going with this. Also, plastic is easier to clean, simply wipe it down with some sort of cleaning solution, where as cloth requires an actual shampooing with equipment. The CTA is a necessity for many of us living in the city, and I for one am grateful for it. But improvements are in order."

362,5,"Apr 9, 2006","After putting up for years with BART in the San Francisco/Bay Area, where it would cost me almost $10 a day to get work on a system that basically shuttled people to work and back and would stop at 12am forcing you to take a $60 cab ride home, I moved to Chicago and got to use the awesome El.  Where else can you ride around looking into people living rooms from the tracks.  The El takes you everywhere for $2, including the airport, and most lines run 24 hours.  On top of that you can get a monthly pass and ride the El as much as you want, something BART will never be able to say.....count your blessings Chicago!"
363,3,"Jun 23, 2009",I'll break it down to you and give it my personal stars for every part of the service. 5 stars because it gets me to where I need to. 5 stars because they now have hybrid buses. That's all the 5 stars they get. everything else about it pretty much sucks. It seems like the drivers make up their own schedules. I use google maps or their bus schedules to show me what time the bus is supposed to leave the bus station or pick me up at a particular stop. I use the Jefferson Park terminal everyday to get home from work.I was testing the google maps transit schedule to see if my 56 Milwaukee bus would leave at like 9:40 pm. Sure enough it was late because the driver came from eating at McDonald's because he had his McDonald bag with him. Also if the driver leaves earlier then the schedule says we all have to suffer on the bus because the drivers will sometimes sit at a bus stop for 5 minutes because they are making up the time. Oh and the 80 Irving Park route sucks too because when they arrive at Irving Park and Central they sometimes have to wait for a new driver to take over the route and one day a few years back we had to wait over a half hour for the new driver. Other buses wouldn't pick us up. Most of the drivers are rude as hell.You can't complain to them because they will yell at you back. They have been working on the EL tracks for years. They said the work would of been all done last winter but it seems like they are starting all over again. i have one more story. I bought a 7 day bus pass and it worked for a couple of days and after a couple of days it wouldn't work. It would say invalid everytime I put it in the slot. All the drivers let me on anyways but there was one driver who wouldn't let me ride. I even showed him that it didn't expire yet but you couldn't tell because the ink that they use to print out the expiration date smeared up. He threatened to call the police on me if I didn't either pay or get off. So that is my review about the CTA.
364,1,"Oct 28, 2013","Once again, I'm waving down the eastbound bus at Peterson and Washtenaw and they drive right past. CTA - you suck! Your drivers are rude, many don't stop. Some wear sunglasses at night which is probably my biggest gripe but now I'm waiting 20 more minutes and possibly more because this bus is never in time according to the cat tracker or text tracker and I'm not talking 1 or 2 minutes, I'm talking in excess of 8-10 minutes. I am not a fan..."
365,1,"Oct 10, 2013",20 minutes late as usual... Peterson and Washtenaw east bound 84 is either too early or too late. You suck!!!
366,1,"Sep 17, 2013","I'm 7 minutes early for a bus, the bus arrives 8 minutes early... The next bus is 30 minutes late.. Same thing with trains. CTA - get your act together!Regards,Washtenaw and Peterson #84"
367,5,"Jun 22, 2007","I hear people complain about the CTA... it's ridiculous. Y'all don't know how good you have it. Fare is totally reasonable... at home (bay area), you pay by distance on the subway... it's a good four bucks to get from Berkeley to SF. A $2 flat fee is nothing, especially when you consider you can transfer b/t lines for free... get from one side of the city to the other? That's a deal. Plus unlimited monthly passes, good for the El and busses, are very reasonably priced if you take public transportation daily (which most of us without cars who aren't hermits do).I mean, c'mon, most lines run all night. Yeah, it sucks that they run somewhat slower than during the day.You know what sucks more? Bay Area trains stop running at 12:30. Get to the station in SF after a show at 12:35? Gotta fork up cash for a taxi. A lot of busses stop running at 9PM. The rest stop running at 12:30. There're three lines in the entire east bay that run at night, they come every 20-45 minutes. That sucks.Back in the olde country, you practically have to be a semi-retarded amputee carrying a newborn and two bags of groceries for someone to yield their seat. Here, every time I've gotten on a train w/o open seats (except for once during rush hour), some nice young businessman's offered me his. Of course, I'm a sweet young thing in heels, but still.So. Stop complaining, stop trying to be New York (big apple envy is the plague of every other city in America), go anywhere else in America, then whine."
368,1,"Aug 23, 2007","I'm trying to think what the CTA deserves one star for....ummm, I can't think of anything.  The following are just a few events that took place in the past two weeks. 1) Mon, Aug 13th p.m. rush- #146 bus breaks down between Addison and Irving.  I took this bus only because I wanted a seat and some air conditioning.  Usually I'd take the #147, but they seem to have a worse rate of break-down this summer anyway.    A #151 comes and instead of waiting for another #146, a few of us think, what the hell, it's better than standing here, waiting and waiting.  But oh nooooo...the #151 bus driver has another idea.  She argues with us that when a bus breaks down, you can't get on another bus route because of some stupid-a$$ rule.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but hasn't the CTA already gotten my fare, and in return, failed to take me to my destination?  Shouldn't I be compensated by being allowed on a bus that will get me there...eventually...even if it is on the slower-than-slow route that the #151 is.  Thankfully the #146 bus driver argued our case and we were allowed on, not after making the rest of the #151 riders annoyed for delaying their commute though. 2) Wed, Aug 15th a.m. rush- Get on an empty #144 bus at Sheridan and Berwyn.  The bus turns the corner onto Foster, collects about 10 more people and then after watching the bus driver and the supervisor talk and point at the back of the bus for about 10 minutes, the driver tells us to get off where we find the back of the bus leaking like the proverbially ""cow on a flat rock"".  Now tell me...HOW did this bus even get out of the bus yard in the first place?  It was clear that when the bus driver picked me up, that it was his first stop for the day.  The bus route number had to be set, buttons pushed, etc. So how, after turning the corner did he all of a sudden realize there was fluid leaking out of the back? ANd if he didn't realize...shouldn't he have, instead of getting us on the bus and then tossing us off to catch another one.  Because that's all we have to do in the morning is get on and off buses in an attempt to get to work. 3) Thurs Aug 16th p.m. rush- Chicago Card Plus fare card stops working out of the clear blue.  No cracks, no scratches, no reason.  I didn't tap dance on it, use it to scrape ice off a windshield, or try to put it in an ATM machine.  But it was safely tucked away in a little bus card holder, in a pocket of my tote bag... THAT must be it!!!  OR, maybe it's that pesky polar magnetic field reversal thingy going on?  That's it though, the card is kaput and I have to order a new one. I'll use my husband's for the time being....stay tuned for more on the fare card. 4) Sat - Aug 18th - Air & Water Show weekend - So I realize buses will be more crowded this weekend and a commute could take longer. I leave Foster & Sheridan at 10:00 a.m. with the hopes of arriving at DIversey and Clark at 11:30.  I wait for about 15 mins for the Foster bus, then decide to walk to Clark.  At Clark, the bus stop is crowded, not a good sign. I walk down a block and then another and after waiting at least a half an hour for the the bus, one comes that is so crammed packed you couldn't squeeze a piece of paper onto it. It's 11:15 at this point, so I give up and take a cab.  The point is, with a major function going on in the city and huge crowds anticipated making the trek toward the air & water show, shouldn't the service be amped up??  I mean after all, all the media keeps saying ""take public transportation, it's the best bet to get there?  Yeah, right!  Maybe the CTA didn't know there was an event going on.  4) MondAug 20th p.m. rush - #147 bus breaks down on Michigan avenue in front of the Hancock.  Yippee, we all had to pack onto an already crowded #147 5) WedAug 22 p.m. rush - I got on a #144 that not only didn't have any air conditioning, but most of the windows were screwed shut, presumably because they don't stay shut when you want them to.  Not like buses leak or anything in the rain...ahem...that's another story altogether.  Ever sit on a completely wet fabric seat first thing in the morning.  One can only hope that it WAS indeed from rain.  Anyway, the no air bus was on a 90+ degree, 100% humidity day.  Thought I was going to pass out. 6) Thurs Aug 23rd a.m. rush - Husband's Chicago Card Plus craps out, so now I have to pay with cash.  And the money on his card, even though it's under my account, can't be transferred to my card.  Of course the card was just topped up yesterday, so unless I want to lose that money, I've got to order ANOTHER card, because these cards never crap out when you have only a couple of dollars on them.  hmmmmm.  Oh, and don't forget the $5 fee to replace the card....so that's $10 in one week, for two cards that have to be replaced. I just get more and more irritated with the CTA, especially in the face of the proposed fare increases and route eliminations."
369,5,"May 14, 2012","I dropped my wallet this morning on the #125, I did not even know I had dropped it until I went to pay for my lunch and...    After reviewing my morning it was pretty clear that I had left it on the bus and was more sure that it was gone forever.  My ID, that was pain (think getting around Chi town during NATO), the credit cards a real pain and the wad of cash, more than $200... what can you say?  I knew they were gone but as a last effort called CTA.   AND THEY HAD IT!!!!  I had to go out to Kedzie to , along way for a guy who lives downtown.  Everyone that I spoke to there was so nice, the security guy walked me to the office, while I waited 3 people POLITELY asked if I had been helped.  I have so much new respect to the employees of CTA.   I walked away from what could have been a miserable experience so so happy and so pleasantly surprised,  Thank you."
370,5,"Sep 25, 2010","Everyone has an opinion, and I respect that. Seems like quite a few people here don't like the CTA. I love it. As you can see, I come from Las Vegas. A public transit user's nightmare.Miss the bus in Chicago? A lot of the time your wait for the next one won't be any longer than 15 minutes. Miss the bus in Vegas? You're screwed. There's only about 8-12 bus lines which take less than 30 minutes between their runs (one of those is The Strip. 2 or 3 of them mostly serve the ghetto. Wow). The rest of them take at least 30 minutes (Some of them take 45 minutes or even a whole entire hour). I would go into other examples, but I don't want to bore anyone in the audience or get so pissed off thinking about my frustrations with the RTC that I throw my laptop into the wall as hard as I possibly can. The CTA is awesome in my opinion. The majority of buses run very frequently and none of the stops are too far away from each other or have useless locations. The eL is amazing, perfect way to explore the city since it's above ground and much easier than having to ride several different buses if you want to go somewhere on a different side of the city.The day passes may seem at little steep with no other basis but are totally worth it once you realize how good the service is. I regularly pay $5.00 for a day pass in Las Vegas (75 cents less than Chicago) and I honestly think that's the biggest rip off in the world with how infrequent, unreliable and generally bad it is. Not only that but they have several express buses which stop at various city landmarks, perfect for tourism. I definitely am biased seeing that I just compare everything to the godawful public transit they have where I live but I really cannot shower the CTA with enough praise. In the city of Chicago I imagine this would be even better than driving."
373,3,"Nov 11, 2011","I really like Chicago tranportation and seems that the green line is the most I take to my internship in the city. I saw my first real pimp and a drug deal for my first time in my life. Seeing new things everyday I guess. Life is unpredictable, especially on the green line!"
374,3,"Jan 26, 2006","I like the El and hate the busses. $1.75 for a ride is a good fare compared with other cities. Chicago card plus is awesome - love getting credit card points for my transit. El isn't fast compared with other cities but it is reliable and they rarely have major service outages (see NYC). Express trains to ORD and MDW will be great. The bus system borders on unacceptable. Waiting 30 mins for busses that are supposed to be 12 minutes apart, only to have 3 come back-to-back-to-back with one nearly empty ... well, there has to be a solution. Someone figure it out."
375,1,"Feb 8, 2013","I called CTA customer service on 1/22 because their lovely system charged me 'per ride' when I had designated it as '30 day pass' . I had switched it a few times before taking my first ride.  I changed it to '30 day pass' on the morning of 1/13/2013 because that was the last day to buy the pass at $86.00.  After a few days, I checked and they were charging me per ride. I called and spoke to a rep and she said, 'You tricked the system'  But my account said '30 day pass' at 9:52am on 1/13 and I didn't take a ride till 10:27am that day.  Sounds like a dullard of a system if it can be tricked that easily!!  She did a case for me and said it would take them a week to get to it due to how busy they were. It is 2/8 and I haven't heard a thing.  Terrible customer service.I doubt I will ever get the refund I'm entitled to.  I have followed-up twice through the Chicago Card Plus website and have referenced my case number each time. CTA, without doubt,  is an unmitigated mess. Also, in case you don't know. CTA raised the price of the monthly pass from $86.00 to $100.00 based on data that their computer system retrieved showing that the majority of the monthly pass users lived on the North Side along the Lake.  They determined that 'these people' had enough disposable income to afford the increase. I guess their computer system is good for something:   Taking advantage of their customers!!"
376,1,"Sep 14, 2011","CTA SUCKS!!!! It is always breaking down, stalling and just takes way too long to go a short distance. For instance, this morning I was to go to the Fairmont on Columbus Ave. I live in the northwest part of the city. According to transitchicago.org the shortest commute was one hour! Yes, one hour to travel 11 miles. Of course, the car is not an option because traffic is horrendous in this city. Gas prices are highest in the country and the parking situation in Chgo is highway robbery. To those that counter with try public transportation in other cities. Well yes I have! Atlanta's Marta is clean and efficient. SF is easy because the city is small. Same with Seattle. Denver's is good also. I have also driven in LA and would rather deal with that traffic than Chicago's CTA. Believe me you get further faster driving in LA!"
377,2,"Oct 20, 2005","The universal truth about Chicago's public transit system is - when it's running well, we love it, but when it's messed up - and it seems to be messed up WAYYY too often, we despise it. Anyone who has travelled exensively to other big cities around the nation/world quickly realizes that our transit system is pretty sad - with some exceptions on the newer lines, much of our city rail system is operating on an infrastructure that was designed over 100 years ago and hasn't changed a whole lot since then. Even more ""modern"" components such as fare card machines break down with frustrating regularity. Folks in the downtown & lakeshore areas are most fortunate, as they have many rail/bus options and more frequent service, but as you move farther from the lake & away from the major train lines, you are almost always better off driving, cycling, or just walking."
378,1,"Jul 2, 2016","The orange line train ,, on the weekend really sucks,you just can't predict if something is going on, for the train to be always late"
379,5,"Jan 9, 2009",I do thank them for processing the paperwork for the medical expenses incurred when the second half of a double long bus crunched me into parked cars when I was riding my bicycle...
380,5,"Jan 9, 2009","They seem to be doing way better than Amtrak.  The system basically serves the city effectively though it is such an old design that an update taking into account potential new routes...well, that's the kind of thing that would take forever, but at any rate, I would trust the CT authority to handle it very well.  Just as a contextual remark, it's more barnlike than the tube but none of the lines run solely underground, so eh, it's inevitably going to be like it is in terms of cleanliness, which is good enough I suppose."
381,3,"Feb 20, 2017","Chicago Transit AuthorityI've been riding the CTA since I could remember. My grandmother can't drive. For years during every weekend when I would stay with her and we would ride the bus and go on an adventure. As a child, riding the bus was fun and adventurous. But as I got older and began to ride the bus it became a reality. It's just a public transportation system. It's not perfect and it's not horrible.  Maybe my judgement was clouded from my childlike mind and the buses have always been the same. But today much of the CTA climate has changed for better and for worse. In order to be an effecient and avid rider of the CTA riders should be able to acclimate to tight spaces, close proximity to others, slow routes. Many of the more popular lines going downtown are crowded especially the trains. The CTA buses are much better than they used to be although some of the newer design choices are questionable. Many old buses with the ""too small seats"" and cramped aisle are still in use today. But most of the buses going around are modern with the automatic doors, proper heating and cooling, wide and comfortable seats, and equipped with a better Ventra card reader. These more modern buses are very comfortable and pleasant to ride on. So after a long day it would be relatively comfortable to ride on the train or bus going home. However, there is one very new model of the CTA buses where the seats are made out of a plastic like material without padding, compared to the older seats these are worst. I've gotten on the bus during a rainy and snow day and you'll find passengers sliding out of the seat struggling to just sit up. These seats are impossible for little children to sit in without getting injured. CTA buses and trains use a new modern card system called Ventra. You can automatically load your Ventra card with the app on your phone and it's very easy and modern compared to most public buses in other cities.  To use the card on the buses and trains you just tap it and go. The downside is the card can be faulty so CTA riders should have backup dollars because no one will have change. I've seen passengers get kicked off the bus in terrible weather because of there card being faulty on Ventra's part.  Overall the CTA is a great means of public transportation around Chicago. It is relatively efficient and saves a lot of money from driving and car services like Uber, especially when going to places like Downtown Chicago everyday."
382,4,"Jan 1, 2009","Growing up in Indianapolis, which lacks any kind of efficient mass transit system, I honestly don't know why people complain so much about the CTA. In an era of rising gas prices, the CTA provides relatively quick, clean, and safe transportation from anywhere in the city to just about anywhere else. I was able to get from my apartment in Lakeview to my job in Hoffman Estates exclusively using public transit. It's something I'm proud of, and something I think locals forget. The CTA isn't perfect, but it's so much better than the alternative, it's not even funny."
383,2,"Jul 14, 2007","Why -o- why must I take the crappy blue line to work daily??? Ok ,CTA is all fine and good MOST of the time IF you are not traveling during rush hour to work. For the life of me I cannot figure out why CTA can't have some more or longer trains running during the 5 to 7 o'clock pm hours. The Blue Line is SO crowded. I don't get it and for that reason I gave the CTA 2 effing stars. And on the same point - why must ppl squeeze there large arses into cars that clearly cannot hold another person? It is OKAY to wait for another train - oh you are right I forgot - that one will be packed too. I hate you CTA."
386,3,"Oct 5, 2007","I'm one of the few people who actually likes the Pink Line and definitely not for its chosen color. It's a great train for those who live in Pilsen and beyond to get quickly into the Loop instead of going on the Blue Line underground. When the Pink Line started up, it actually cut down on my commute time to work. I agree that it definitely slows down the Loop trains going through, but it still works for me just fine."
387,4,"Jun 26, 2012","We were in town for 4 days. I had really positive experience with CTA. We got 3-day pass and saved a lot of money that way. We pretty much went around Chicago on Red, Green and Blue line. It's really convenient to take CTA if you want to go to Lincoln Park and Wicker Park area from the loop. It's not hard to navigate at all. Certainly not as complicated as NYC's MTA."
388,3,"May 8, 2008","My bus pass claims that the CTA is: On Time. Well, they're getting better since management changed, but the CTA has yet to find that happy balance between early and late, as the media is always quick to report.Clean. If you consider ""smelling of bizarre industrial cleanser"" clean. Now if they could get rid of the disgusting felt seats, we'd be in business.Safe. Not so much. Anyone who has ever been subjected to a ""why my life sucks and you should give me money"" speech from someone who has the distinct rattle of pills about them will likely agree.Friendly. I've had a handful of friendly bus drivers, and I'm sure working for the CTA means oodles of stupid questions from directionally and life-challenged individuals. Most employees I've seen have a distinct  ""please let the torture end soon"" look about them. Probably because they've got passengers who attempt to exit a rapidly moving vehicle on a frighteningly regular basis.We must all pause to remember that not everyone has a transit system like we do in Chicago, and management seems to be legitimately trying to make it better. But if you've ever wanted to be excruciatingly close to your fellow man, take an express bus downtown at 7:30AM."

Thats close to 10 percent (like paying tides in church).  That is crazy (although I dont give tides anymore to a church  rather invest it into social services). People you need to wake up.  CTA really needs to step up  on picking up passengers on time at the bus and train stations.  Those that are sleeping on the job should be given verbal  and then final written warnings when sleeping on the job in carts. I have eyes. And you guys should do something about the bums that smell up the train.  Not only that, they harass people."

The bus stop used to be exactly where the man was but now it is moved across the street so busses do not block and create traffic when buss would pull over. Im sure it is cta's policy to not let people on when theres no bus stop, but surely bus drivers should use some discression. this show what horrible people the cta has hired to run their system!"
391,1,"Nov 5, 2012","Today I watched with horror as my Chicago Card slid from my hands on the Francisco platform and onto the tracks. Seeing as it is a ground level station I figured I could, at the very least, make the station attendant aware of the situation and possibly retrieve my card at a later time. Instead, what I got was a lengthy lecture on how this happens all the time, how this employee is old and can't just jump down onto the tracks anymore, how I needed to swipe my card, place it into my wallet and then proceed through the turnstile and so on... basically I was berated and treated like an annoyance. As we walked to the opposite end of the platform (Francisco has a North and South entrance) I was lectured non-stop. When I showed the employee where the card was - a mere 5 feet inside the crossing entrance - I offered to stand on the platform at it's location as a visual queue to the employee. Instead I was yelled at and told to stand at the gate so I could let them back in. Guess what, the employee walked 15 feet past the card and loudly complained that he couldn't find the card. So much for trying to be proactive and helpful, right?Great customer service CTA. I work with client's all day and I don't lecture them about my personal likes and dislikes, nor do I give them a piece of my mind because, god forbid, I have to get out of my seat at my desk to assist them. It's part of my job! And, guess what CTA, your customers are individuals and don't appreciate being clumped together into a group set aside for general spite and malicious commentary. You work in an industry that sees hundreds of thousands of people a day, so things are going to happen and they're going to often times be similar in nature. But that doesn't give you the right to berate your customers.If the CTA had a policy in place where they don't retrieve cards from the tracks, but instead give the customer instructions on how to deactivate the card and request a new one - then I would have understood and followed suite. What I don't need is belittlement and hand slapping at the hands of your employees for an honest error."
392,2,"Oct 21, 2008","I have tried SO hard to support you through the years.  HOW many times have I said ""oh I'll take the el........."" vs. taking a cab or driving. I have stuck by your side thru thick and thin.  I have spent untold thousands on you. I have taken my friends, my 72 year old mother - I even make my friends take the el to my home from O'Hare, picking them up at the Irving Park stop.I have watched people puke and sleep and eat and beg for money and LIVE on the el. But my patience is wearing thin.  1.  Does it really have to take me 45-60 min to go 9 miles from the Brown Line Francisco stop to the loop?  Really?  Seriously?2.  I have a Chicago Plus Card. I supported you on this venture. But my company hands out CTA checks to supplement our transit costs.  The ONLY place in the city to my knowledge where we can go to put the check on our Plus Card is at your Lake Street office.  Honest to god? Not even Jewel or Dom's can be set up to accommodate this? We have to march our ass to Lake and Jefferson?  3.  Again - the Chgo Plus Card.  I can't check my balance at the kiosks in the stations? I have to do it online?4.  The personnel at the Lake St office have about as much personality as a Qtip. They are often rude, condescending and surly. I have noticed - this KILLS me - that for the last year they have now posted signs at each window ""Please wait to be called to the window."" Why? So they can continue talking on the phone and filing their nails? And WHY are there always closed windows when there are people in line - especially at lunch time?I have saved my most recent bitch for last - your new idea to remove seats from the Brown Line cars so as to accommodate more riders.  What is this - Japan? Are you soon going to have workers whose job it is to stand at each station and push everyone onto the train? Go to Youtube to see this high tech approach.  Or, wait - maybe you already did.Tonight was my first experience with this new endeavor.  I got on the Brown Line at Madison and Wabash at 5:20 pm and I had to stand for the next 50 minutes until I got to Francisco - 2 stops from the end of the line. Unless every Chicagoan loses 65 lbs, I do not believe that making most of us stand will help more people fit on the car. I looked around me - and most everyone looked tired and pissed as hell. I hope this latest idea of yours fails and fails miserably.Recently I attended a lecture by an architecture professor who said that the mass transit system in Chicago is like something you would find in a Third World country. I am starting to think I agree with him."
393,2,"Jul 5, 2008","Dear CTA,Please install more ""Visitor pass"" kiosk at Midway Airport.It's a main gateway into the fair city of Chicago, I don't like waiting behind tourist from downstate or good forbid Michigan, where they have horrible transportation options.   I want to get in...buy my tourist pass...and ""be out""!I would use the regular machine, but I don't want to buy a ""buy the ride"" card as the tourist card is more economical.Over the trip on the Orange line from Downtown to the loop, is easy, quick, economical and pretty much uneventful.  It's certainly better than renting a car and trying to find parking or using a parking garage especially if the majority of the things you plan to do are withing a few miles radius of the loop.  Transit and walking a definitely your best bet.If you're going to buy a transit card at Midway, please be advised you might have to wait in line to purchase.  There are ""regular"" machine, and machines that dispense, ""visitor"" passes.  Most machines take credit cards.  WARNING - Be prepared to potentially miss a train while waiting in line.My only other comment is some stations could use a refresher, as some stations look right out of a horror flick, but I understand the transportation budget sucks."
394,2,"Nov 1, 2010","I have such mixed feelings about the CTA. I take the 156 daily to and from work, and other buses as needed. I take the train less often, but I've commuted on it in the past, and still use it occasionally.Even though the prices keep going up, it's still less than a cab or parking, so I won't complain about that. Sometimes the buses or trains break down and make me late for work, but that's just life, so I won't complain about that. In the snow sometimes there are great delays and you're waiting in the freezing cold for a long time, but that's Chicago weather, so I won't complain about that. There are a few things that I will complain about, though as a general rule I hate complainers. There is just no consistency to the ""bus driver rules"". I've been on buses that are so packed people are literally stuffed up against the front door and have to move at stops to allow the door to open. Once the driver apologized and said she was required to stop at every stop no matter what, and it was up to the rider if they wanted to/could squeeze onto the bus. I've also been on buses where the driver adamantly obeys the ""behind the yellow line rule"" and says if the bus is full with everyone at the line, they don't stop at new stops unless someone wants to get off. Both sound plausible to me, but they are polar opposites, who is lying to me? I've had numerous instances where I pull the stop cord, hear the ding, and see ""Stop Requested"" flash on the screen by the driver, and they still don't stop at my stop. I've often been standing at a stop (I take the 156) when the 151 is picking up passengers. Then the 156 drives by and sees the bus there and passes it, quickly en route to the next stop, not caring about those of us waiting at THIS stop, like if the 151 isn't good enough for us, we're out of luck. This doesn't always happen, but often enough. I've also been standing at a bus stop more than once with no other bus around, and had the bus driver just cruise right by me. Sometimes they see me and stop up ahead, letting me run through traffic in the busy street to climb on. Sometimes they are so oblivious they just keep cruising. Am I crazy, or is noticing riders waiting at stops a big park of bus driving? I've been on a bus as it pulls away from a stop, and someone comes running up banging on the door. The bus is now 3 feet from the stop where the person stands, looking forlorn and late, and the drivers don't stop. I tried to find online if there is some bill of rights for CTA passengers like when you're in a cab, and it turns out we have no rights. And I find no information about the so-called rules that various drivers have told me about, all being different. I'll continue to take the bus...because I have no other options. But it's a shame some drivers seem to get great thrills from their power over us. Ruling this commuting world. Truly, what could we do that would affect them? Writing a review seems to be my only option. I have emailed the CTA before (a few times) and I've never heard back. I know I've said this in like...a million other reviews (or at least one), with unemployment so high, find people who will do the job AND be friendly. Or warn drivers they also need to be pleasant or their jobs are at risk. One tip: if you smile sweetly and greet your driver with a good morning, good afternoon, or good evening; it does seem to make their day. I bet half their grump is from a complete lack of appreciation."
395,3,"Jun 30, 2006","Its nice to visit a city with a full public transportation system.  The trains were a bit dirty, and the ding dong of the shutting doors got old pretty quickly.  I'm sure if I lived in Chicago I would have a love for the El much like I have a love for the T even though its similar to the El in a lot of ways.    You definitely get a nice old city feel as you walk around the loop and see and walk under the old raised tracks.  As we headed out and back to Ohare we had to wait a bit longer than I'd like for a blue line heading in that direction, but I guess you can't ask for much on a Sunday morning.  I have to admit the pink line looks exciting and fun- I could get into it if I was living there!"
398,5,"Oct 19, 2011","The ease of use of the CTA made my whole trip to Chicago. It was extremely easy to use, a 3 day pass was a great value ($14), and the trains/buses were all clean and on schedule."
399,4,"Aug 30, 2008",So far I've lived in Chicago for about 2 weeks. I just moved here from California and I am digging the public transportation. Years of driving in Cali traffic are behind me. I like the convenience of the CTA. There's always a spot for me whether it's a train or bus. It does take longer than hopping in a car but that's overrated. I spend more time thinking about more important things than someone that just cut me off. Now I'm driving to the beat of a different drum. Cali suckers! I'll still come and visit you.
400,3,"Aug 6, 2008","3.5+ for getting me to work for a reasonable price compared to gasoline in my car and parking downtown. Most of the CTA staff have been pretty decent and nice. But during all this construction it can feel like 0 stars... the long commute of 1.5 hours sometimes..and at times 45min. So damn inconsistent. However, hopefully they will get it right and we can have some peace of mind of traveling to work within' an hour in the city. Then the stars will go back up to 4+ stars."
401,5,"Feb 16, 2007","How bad can the CTA get ?  Clearly a lot worse in the near future if you're a Red Line rider now that they are going to shut down tracks for the Fullerton and Belmont remodels.  However....  consider yourself lucky if you get on the 'Blessed Train'.  Conductor Arthur Scales(?) is easily the nicest guy out there. Not only are his announcements really really nice but if you're on the first car when you get off and happen to catch his beautiful smile you are very lucky indeed.  What a great guy.  We are lucky to have the CTA but it truly has been terrible lately,  so it's a real pleasure to occasionally get Mr.Scales. I wish I rode his train every day. The 'Blessed Train' is the BEST train!"
402,1,"Jun 30, 2008","My biggest problem with the CTA is they don't accept credit cards.  I use the Blue Line regularly, and admittedly do need to get a Chicago Card, but the more elegant system that New York's MTA and San Francisco's MUNI for example have worked out is to allow fare purchase by credit.  This city is vying for an olympic bid, but they can't even make their public transportation convenient for the casual rider?  I've also been long disappointed by their spotty service record, having waited up to 45 minutes for a bus before I ended up calling a taxi.  They just rolled out some new system where you can track how far off the next bus is to you, but not all lines are added, and I've yet to see it in use.  I applaud their effort to keep up with technology, but in this instance it is only because they are implementing a system where newer buses outfitted with flat-panel TVs will be able to target  advertisements to specific neighborhoods based on their GPS location.  All this while I can't even buy my fare at the time of commute electronically."
403,1,"Apr 4, 2015","Corruption.CTA workers are a reflection of the lack of education that is the reality of Chicago's economically depressed neighborhoods. They behave like a gang of unprofessional street people.If the CTA employees hear you complain they will take your picture and ""group stalk you"". It cost too much money to ride filthy CTA buses or subway ($10 for a day pass or $2.25 for one ride with no transfer) First of all, I advise any visitor in Chicago to NOT take public transportation anywhere....but if you must ride CTA avoid any economically depressed area. Chicago is extremely dangerous and corrupt. The city is going bankrupt it recently closed 55 schools in the intercity. The undereducated Chicagoans gang mentality is displayed in the behavior and attitude of CTA employees that I encountered. If you are taking subway going from Midway airport or O'Hare airport to downtown or Northside..you ""MAY""be safe. Anything else you are putting your reputation and life in danger. CTA workers work as one single ""gang of stalkers"". They view anyone that is educated or ""speaks out, complain""as a threat. There is no freedom of speech in Chicago...saying anything can get you ""gang group stalked or killed""."
404,5,"Oct 31, 2006","Dude. Your train is like, on the ground, undergound, UP HIGH. That is awesome. The whole time I was here I didn't have to take the cab ONCE. It ran mostly 24-7! The visitors pass was dirt cheap and worked on the bus! I could figure it out within days! Or a day, really. Frequent stations! I know there are some FOUL homeless people and the wait took a while sometimes-but stopping being a princess. Try not having public transportation. It sucks."
405,4,"Sep 8, 2010","Love the flat $2.25 fare to use the entire system.  Also loved how easy it was to get from MDW to our hotel near the water downtown.  The old wooden platforms in the loop have a lot of character, and the stations are nice and close.  Further out, the distance is a bit greater, but the system seemed to work well for us during our 48 hour visit.  Getting to and from the airport was a breeze, which made a great impression on this tourist.  Big plus allowing food/drink on the train.  I was pleased to be able to keep my morning coffee with me as I went through the turnstile.  Word of advice to other tourists.  Express machines will only add a minimum of $5 to your fare card.  Regular machines will let you add less than that if you just need fare back to Midway or O'Hare."
406,4,"Jul 12, 2006","As a frequent visitor to Chicago, I have utilized the CTA system many a time, and it has served me well.  The trains and buses get me wherever I want to go at a cheap rate, and best of all, I don't have to worry about driving!  Any problems or confusion I've had taking public transportation were a result of myself simply not really knowing where I was going--but a simple consultation of the CTA route map before setting out to somewhere new usually guarantees a smooth trip.  As for the cleanliness, etc, of the facilities, I'm satisfied.  I mean, considering the sheer number of  buses and trains, and the amount of people passing through each day, I don't think much more can be expected."
407,4,"Feb 25, 2007","My favorite way to get around. As a girl from elsewhere, I feel pretty safe on the El. I feel comfortable talking to the employees (although twice have been given really bad advice- be careful who you ask) and asking for directions. Just one star off for employees who don't even know where the Metra station is!"
410,3,"Oct 31, 2012","My Chicago Card was set to expire next month, so I had to go down and get a new one since I had a balance on the existing one and that's the only place you can go get the balance transferred.  Kinda inconvenient since they are only open 8-4:30 M-F when most people work.  But at least I found parking across the street and it only cost me 25 cents since I was in and out in about 5 minutes."
411,3,"Apr 3, 2006","I've been trying to figure out the CTA system since moving here last week and it's pretty complicated! However, I think the problem is that I moved here from Florida where I spent all my time in the car. Hopefully I'll have the Bus and El figured out in no time!"
412,4,"Aug 26, 2010",The national past time of Chicago is complaining about the CTA. I like it though.
413,4,"Apr 23, 2010","I'm sure if I lived here and had to deal with CTA everyday I'd have a different opinion entirely, but as a visitor to the city all I can say is you are very fortunate to have such a well-run, efficient system with such a friendly staff.  I live in a city with old, broken down buses and I was envious every time I saw one of your beautiful, large buses sail by, stopping at well-labeled, capacioius shelters.I took the Blue line out to the airport.  Fast & efficient!  The guys at the ticket area thoughtfully helped me figure everything out, with that typical Chicago friendliness. It must be a terrific place to live--everyone seems so nice! (except the attitudinous ticket sellers at the Art Institute!)"
414,3,"Apr 30, 2014","Recently visited from Boston and we decided to try a day pass to get around.    Our hotel was right next to the ""L"".    $10 for unlimited use in a 24 hour period.   We thought that was a pretty good deal!     There are vending type machines at each 'station', easy to get...we just used exact cash.     We just looked up most of the places we wanted to go on YELP and most of the time there was an option for directions by ""Transit"" and it gave us the station we should get off at.   We grabbed a map at one of the stations and used that a few times too.      The few employees we did talk with did help us...   I think it was fairly clean for a subway system.    We thought Chicago was fairly easy to navigate compared to other areas we've been to.We ended up purchasing a 2nd day and used it to go back to the airport (Midway)...it was easy and you can't beat the price."
415,1,"Feb 11, 2016",While paying for a  seven day pass at the Roosevelt Station I put in 27 dollars in cash attempted to put in one more dollar in machine the goddamn thing jammed up I was told I had to ho to office on Clinton street . Seriously? You can't issue me a pass now I have to take two hours off of work to get a replacement card because your closed after 4 mon thru Friday and closed on Saturday? Unbelievably ass backward piss poor customer service
416,4,"Jul 3, 2013",The Pink Line is one of the better CTA train lines in the Chicago area. It's cleaner and less crowded than most of the other lines.
417,3,"Mar 15, 2013","The CTA is alright. The trains and buses are fairly reliable and they get me to where I want to go. In all honesty, I'd rather take public transportation than drive."
418,3,"Dec 27, 2006","Yes the Pink Line is completely stupid.  However, I feel the need to give it 2.5-3 stars (depending on the day) because I can use it to get to and from work without having to ride the far inferior #21 Cermak bus.  I also don't have to transfer and I get more exercise."
419,1,"Dec 3, 2009","For the life of me, I cannot figure why Chicago residents put up with this archaic, slow system that routinely makes people late. Perhaps it is better than LA, but is light years behind the subway in NYC and the Metra in D.C. Chicago sucks anyway, but this horrible system makes things so much worse."
420,1,"Oct 6, 2008","Anyone who thinks the CTA is even remotely adequate has never lived in or even briefly visited a city with a proper public transportation system. You can wax poetic about the clackety-clack of the dear ol' El, but the truth is this is exactly what you get when a complex public transport system is turned over to toadies whose only qualification (literally!) is that they have proven themselves to be utterly devoted to King Richard and ready to serve His Will no matter what. In theory, if they could somehow figure out how to surf the Net without removing their noses from the King's puckered aperture, they might be able to learn at least as much about how to run a major city transport system as Wikipedia has to offer, but there is no evidence that this has happened, not with Kruesi and not with Kruesi #2. To put it simply: the CTA is an utter and unmitigated disgrace. Huberman has taken to threatening blackmail on local citizens if they refuse to enable his plans to loot TIF funds and such - he actually told the crowd in Rogers Park that if they didn't fork it over, he'd walk away and leave the Howard Station renovation half-finished and derelict. (Well, in this case the whole project is so ill-conceived that even finished it will still be derelict. But at least it won't cost $50 million to abort the whole thing, like a certain half-baked mega-station downtown....)If the IOC doesn't run away screaming from this stinking pile of corruption of a town, well... the fix is in.They say you get the government you deserve. We Chicagoans must be really, really bad people to deserve this."

425,4,"Nov 4, 2010","This is a pretty good train ride. The people aren't overly peculiar. There seems to be a decent general mix of students, working professionals, and races. The cta train conductors are on-top of their jobs for the most part. The train is never dirty or smelly. It's a pretty fair ride, I'd say!"
426,4,"Mar 15, 2010",I like the Pink Line. It could be perfect if it didn't have to loop so to by pass that if i'm downtown i normally take the green heading to harlem and get off at clinton or ashland and it's scenic and mellow.
427,5,"Apr 2, 2011","When I'm in one of my home cities, I LOVE riding the Chicago Transit Authority ""L"" Trains.  Used to ride the Blue Line from Forest Park to O'Hare International Airport every weekend and spend a full day connecting to other lines and branches.  I have to say, these people know what customer service is all about.  Their staff and management are so kind and provide a ton of valuable information on the city and suburbs to visitors and locals.  It doesn't matter if your White, Black, Purple, Blue, Red, etc. these people treat everyone with the utmost respect.  Their trains are also among the cleanest I have ever seen for a wide County train net work.  Not even the Metro in Washington DC can compete with the CTA's Customer service.  I give them 5/5 stars for Customer service and public relations.  Awesome work and keep it up.  Wish you the rider a truly awesome experience."
428,1,"Aug 16, 2010","Dear CTA,We have to talk. This just isn't working out between you and me. The $80 dollar monthly passes, the half hour waits for a bus during the day, and the excess of crazies on the train. It just isn't working out.I've cheated on you a few times with taxis, but that's because you're not that dependable to get me where I need to go in rush. And everytime I walk somewhere at night after getting tired of waiting for you, you finally come one bus stop away from my destination. You're ignorant, twice this month you passed me by at the Irving park bus stop while I wailed my arms at you. And while I see you waste a green light to wait for a guy in a wheel chair a two blocks aways, you almost never do the same for me. My bike on the otherhand, it's dependable. It always takes the same amount of time to get from one place to another. And it never pukes on me, asks me for money or makes me wait.So it was a good run I guess. But it had to end. But don't worry, we'll see each other soon, like trips down town or blizzardy days when I'm desparate.  But I know there's someone out there for you. Like maybe 3.5 millions someones out there. And their sleeping right now. But I'll be darn if they don't ride you hard tommorrow. I bet you won't even miss me.Best,Sarah"
429,4,"Nov 7, 2005","Having ridden public transit in many cities, I can say this: the CTA isn't perfect, but it's closer than we in Chicago give it credit for. Yes, the busses are sometimes late, but they always show up. The El takes us to and from all corners of the city-all for $75 a month. I haven't owned a car since 2000, and barely miss it at all. Those who hate on the CTA must want chauffeur driven limos, not subways and busses."
430,3,"Jan 4, 2008","I hate waiting for purple lines and seeing like 5 gazillion brown lines pass by.  Other than that, it's not so bad, but the DC subway is much better (but pricier)."
431,1,"May 20, 2015","I believe that whoever is charge of the CTA should take a long look at revamping the fare system.  First of all if you want to attract new passengers you must give them an incentive to ride.  One incentive is to carry over transfers & eliminate the 2 hour expiration.  Many times I only need to take one bus & trip, yet waste money on transfers I don't need.    $2.25 is pretty steep for people who are out of jobs & it quickly depletes their cash.  Perhaps CTA could make a provision for individuals who need transportation for job interviews.  Right now the IDES has this requirement that job seekers attend school.  School is not going to put cash in their pocket so their focus should really be on getting to & from their interview places that are outside of Chicago.Yes Governor Rauner you can have a hand at this too & stop the reductions & cuts you love to implement.  You want a taste of what it is like, join us on the street & everywhere else so you can learn how the other half lives."
432,3,"Dec 9, 2007","I used to bemoan Chicago's public transit (when compared to Taipei's much more modern and cleaner system) but then I moved out to Silicon Valley. Public transit there sucks @$$ and makes me long for the El. Sure it can be a little sketchy and I wouldn't recommend riding alone at night but the El gets you to where you need to go. And it's cheaper than trying to drive and park (especially in the Loop and the near North Side). The Chicago Card is a nice upgrade to the fare system, like Taipei's EasyCard. Plus, it's a Chicago icon."
435,4,"Oct 15, 2011","On a recent visit to Chicago, we took the Blue line to/from the airport and also took it around the city with a 3-day pass. Coming from a city (san francisco) where i also take public transportation, i have say we were pleasantly surprised at how clean the trains/buses were compared to our bus/train system. We also found the buses to be pretty convenient without  having to wait long for the buses."
436,4,"Apr 20, 2006","I can generally rely on the cta for all my transport needs but today I had two bad experiences :(  The redline was being worked on in the middle of the day and we just sat in between stops for about 10 minutes....insane if I had actually been on some sort of schedule (fortunately I was not) and then I realized that the orange line is really inefficient if you're just above where it would be going back out toward Midway....you have to go around the whole frickin' loop for chissake.  Oh well.  As I said, generally I have no problems and I love it.  Today was some sort of fluke."
437,3,"Dec 16, 2007","dirty, smelly, expensive, inefficient, unorganized, poorly funded. I lost my wallet and it took me 20 minutes of pushing buttons to talk to a real person. The guy that found it told me he took it to the police station for fear that the train station managers would steal it. Three stars because its cheaper than taxis and being above ground in the middle of the city is kinda cool."

BOO! and BOO! - I would have only given you one BOO!, to match my stars, but I am trying to make my point here.I've lived in Chicago since Sept. of 2001, and have never owned a car - which has left me to travel on foot & by bike, and in inclement weather I have to depend on the CTA, unfortunately (most of the time).Overall, I find it rather disgraceful - has anyone who's in charge of the CTA ever been abroad? How is it that countries and continents ages older than this one (SO progressive & new) offer far better public transportation?Years of practice I suppose.I've spent years trying to be forgiving of the trains that never come, the nearly empty buses that blow by as if all the people lined up on the rainy/snowy/windy/stormy/freezing cold street are invisible, the continually unexplained fare hikes, the less than informed drivers, and the out of order card machines. BOO! CTA - shame on you, Chicago for not figuring it out - get it together already - I mean, after all do you want to be responsible for the potential gold medal winning Olympians arriving LATE to their event?!Oh, and I love this one:"" We heard you, Chicago....'CTA (Blue Line), putting the Rapid back in transit"".Hilarious.BOO!"
440,2,"Nov 24, 2009","OK, I am now slightly less angry with you. Though I am still not happy about waiting twice as long for the already-pokey Damen bus."
441,1,"Oct 12, 2009","Dear CTA,Wow, I'm really looking forward to paying even more for your totally subpar service! I'm so glad that increasing my train fare by $.50 wasn't enough for one twelve-month period. I'm thrilled that an even larger portion of my paycheck can go toward supporting freeloading senior citizens and retired CTA employees with bloated pensions. Best of all, thanks to the $6 I'll have to pay for a round-trip on the El, you'll be able to continue overpaying the 9,000 remaining union employees, even though most of them are outrageously bad at their jobs. And to top it all off, I'll get to stand out in the cold for even longer while I wait for buses and trains that will run even less frequently.That's awesome, CTA. It really is. I can't thank you enough for providing a service that is both more expensive and and crappier than transit in Boston, New York, Washington, San Francisco...where IS our money going?"
442,2,"Feb 23, 2010","Hate riding public transport, smelly, and is just me or do the trains stop for just a quick high and bye, how about actually stopping. I also think they need to train the riders, let people off then get on, easy enough people. Then there are the buses, really there has to be a bus stop at every intersection? I also like how they pull out into traffic as if they are the only vehicles on the street. Overall the CTA does what is supposed to do, I guess my gripe is with the soo courteous fellow riders. Enjoy the view out the window, you could be back in Iowa."
443,4,"Nov 30, 2005","God bless the CTA, it gets me to work, and I don't have to hunt for an impossible parking space. On the downside, I HATE when the El and bus are late, it messes me up bad. I also think the 35th st. Sox station needs a bathroom facility badly, there's nowhere to go when you gotta go. Finally, overall I think the CTA system is the lifeblood of the city, just needs to be cheaper I think so more people can take advantage of it."
444,3,"Dec 14, 2007","Four stars because I don't own a car and don't need one.  I live in Andersonville and take the red line in - living so far north, I almost always have a seat.  (Ha ha, Lincoln Park snobs.)  I rarely have to wait more than five or ten minutes for a train, and honestly, there are days when my forty-minute commute is the most peace I've had all day.  I pull out the knititng (yes, I'm one of those people), pop in the earbuds, and it's happy relaxing time.But there's a star deduction because omg the buses.  First, why can't the #22 have decent buses?  It runs from Polk to Howard, a HUGE run, yet we've got some of the oldest, crappiest buses out there.  Maybe they can give us some of those nice tourist buses, those express ones that are being cancelled.  While most of my bus drivers have been pleasant, I'd love for certain ones to get a refresher course in how not to give your passengers motion sickness by slamming the brake every   half-block.  Also, whoever said to cut out bus stops is totally right.  Why do we have stops at almost every street in River North/Lincoln Park/etc.?  It's ridiculous.  I'd love to see CTA staff walking the trains at night, too, but that will never happen."
445,3,"Jul 1, 2008","The CTA has its problems but for the most part I'm pretty happy with it. Being originally from a city with essentially no public transportation, I'm fairly impressed with the CTA as a whole. With that said I wish they would display the arrival times for the trains more openly (similar to how the subways work in Washington D.C.)"
448,4,"Sep 9, 2009","Honestly, after riding the MTA and DC Metro, the CTA looks a lot better to me."
449,3,"Jan 6, 2009","As far as mass transit goes, the CTA is really not THAT bad. Especially the train. The bus is an entirely different matter.Went to NYC for the first time and used the subway... Incredibly confusing and it made me thankful for the L.My biggest complaints though are:A. The Bus - Always, always, always late. Bus drivers will drive right by you, lie to you about what stops they're making, and some of them are downright racist. Which I hate to say, but it's definitely true.B. The Train - The delays are ridiculous and I get tired of trying to figure out which stops aren't going NB for a day, etc. My worst train experience came from being stalked by a homeless man to 2 train cars, and no one helped me. I got off at the Belmont stop (red line) and walked past 2 different CTA employees. This homeless man was quite OBVIOUSLY following me (hiding behind things and staring at me, following me when I moved). I even went downstairs and stood by the guards near the gate, again they did nothing. I was really scared and the fact no one helped me (at 10am on a weekday) worries me."
450,4,"Jan 11, 2011",The CTA has greatly improved. It now has the new 5000 car series for the trains and i can't wait until they put the cars on every line. The buses are inconvenient at times. If you combine the bus with train sometimes your train will show up at your stop and then the bus you are waiting for leaves and your stuck for about 20 minutes. All together though the CTA  is very good :)

I remember when it was 75cents. The 3 day passes are overly priced. The Irving bus driver passed me up 3 times last week. Some bus drivers are so ignorant and need to either like their job or fake that they do cause there's not to many jobs open. The winter waits are a bitch so cold in the morning. The panhandlers on the green line its like I'm hurting to try and get a job. As much work as your puting into panhandleing put into asking for an application. I'll still be using you though I have no choice."
454,3,"Jan 20, 2010","i love public transit. especially when i was living downtown while i went to saic and had a upass. it's pretty affordable. i used to just ride around on buses and trains when i was bored, and now i'm pretty good at getting just about anywhere on the el. i really wish the system ran farther out into the suburbs, because i hate metra rail with a burning fucking passion."
455,4,"Jan 15, 2007",There is definitely a lot that could be improved. More trains for one (is a circle line that much to ask for?). But most of the time the trains run often and on time. The buss routes (which could also be expanded) run to alot of places in the city. All in all id say its the best transit system ive seen and it certainly does a lot for me.
456,2,"Dec 19, 2012","CTA has enough issues with the transit systems that you'd think I'd be smart enough to not try to order a poster from their online store as a Christmas gift. I partially blame myself on this one, but seriously CTA gift store, get your act together. I placed an order for a poster that was listed as in stock on 12/11/12. Plenty of time for the USPS to deliver it to me in the standard first class mail shipping time. Today, as I'm just beginning to wonder where my package is, and why it's still listed as ""in process"" in my account, I get an email saying:""I am writing with an update on your order as the print is not in stock at the moment in our warehouse and would not arrive until after Christmas. I wanted to give you the option to change to one of our Quick Ship items which would arrive before Christmas of to check if we were ok with post holiday delivery.""Typos aside, this email is still appalling. Because it came to me a full 8 days after I placed the order. I understand that things can go out of stock, but normally don't you figure that out a day or maybe even two after the order was placed?? I now have to scramble to find something else, and those quick ship gifts did not compare to the poster I originally selected. Again, I should have known better, but CTA, you should be embarrassed. While I appreciate do the offer of allowing me to switch my item, which probably shows you realize you screwed me over, I'm waiting on a response about how I can cancel the order. And yes, this review can get worse based on that response.Moral of the story, don't buy things in the CTA store. Pay a little extra and get the posters and items on other websites or in a store downtown."
457,2,"Sep 7, 2013","CTA has two things going for it. 1. Affordable2. You can go anywhere in the city.As long as you don't mind sitting next to a homeless person, riding in filth, long transit times and delays. And don't expect any CTA employee to ever help you. They look at you like you just spoke to them in a foreign language and walk away. I mean they are the most Ghetto people I have ever encountered. If you need any help look around the station and ask anyone else but them!DC Metro system is far superior and the employees can actually communicate."
458,1,"Nov 4, 2014","I honestly hate the CTA. 93 is the worst bus ever. It's ALWAYS running late, and I am constantly late. I downloaded an app to tell me what time the bus will be here and it's always changing. I'm very disappointed in this bus. Get your schedules corrected!"
461,3,"Apr 7, 2015","Hmm where do I start. I see many people complaining about how slow CTA is when they are in a hurry but reality is if you are on a timed schedule you need to leave early and take into consideration that there maybe something that may make you late. Like a late bus or problems with CTA systems etc. YOU have to be responsible enough to leave earlier than what you are leaving now to ensure you will be on time to where ever you are going duhhh. Anyways they only thing wrong with CTA is the employees I don't even know how half of them are keeping their jobs. I say hello to every employee I come across when boarding the bus some say hello back and others don't. Today I got on the 53A and said hello, the man driving the bus looked at me up and down gave me a dirty look and looked away. I just said ''okay."" Then the last stop is the 31st terminal and he stated customers can not get dropped off in the terminal which is complete bs because I take that bus every day and always go into the terminal. So I argued with him not because he was kicking me off but because he was lying and was completely rude! I come across people like this daily which is sad because this is a CUSTOMER SERVICE JOB, so if you don't like customers then this is clearly not a job for you and you should start looking for another one. Simple. Besides complaining about workers, if you are looking for a affordable and easy way to get around Chicago then CTA is good for you. :)"
462,4,"Apr 2, 2015",We would encourage anyone visiting Chicago to purchase the CTA Ventra card. This card can be used on the buses and subways as well. We used both daily and we purchased our cards at a local Walgreens. Such a great deal and incredibly convenient!! We had so many kind bus drivers assist us in finding our way to several destinations. Many of whom remembered where we had asked to go and cued us prior to arriving at the scheduled stop. This was especially helpful as we traveled with two teens one of which is Autistic. Thank you to the CTA staff!! Job well done!'
463,1,"Apr 1, 2013",These are some of the most incompetent people I have ever interacted with in my life.  Your machines don't work and I have to pay for it?  I have to take a half day off work just to get to your headquarters and fix a problem that YOU created?  So unacceptable.
464,3,"Jan 13, 2009","Yes, the rate increase sucks - but even the cost of socks and water has gone up.  I think the CTA has so many more UPS and DOWNS than anything else in this city.  I've waited one hour one day, and one minute the next.  I've been rained on by leaky escape hatches in the ceiling, spit-up on by babies who can't handle the bumpiness of Division St near Cabrini Green, spilled on, grinded on... and the list goes on.  However I do feel that the bus service has spruced up on my routes, I never have to wait long for the Blue line, and bus service has gotten quite better as well.  Customer Service can use a few more training courses, but we know that that Chicago attitude is going to come out when cornered either way.  I know mine does!  I find myself on the side of the bus drivers more often - calling in complaints on cabs who make my morning coffee spill, and who make me bounce a seat up when they cut us off and the bus tries to pop a wheelie!  In a nutshell, the CTA isn't that bad for me anymore.  I know I'll be right here again, updating on all my experiences!"
465,3,"Mar 13, 2007","Convenient and can take you anywhere in the city you want to go.  BUT the bus routes are quite illogical and it would make more sense to run in agrid pattern instead of having eight different Michigan Avenue routes that turn in different areas or weave in and out of streets going east and west.  Many CTA workers have no knowledge of how to get from one place to another if you ask, some times there tend to be many technical problems.  The last three times I rodethe train, the train stopped for no good reason for 20-45 minutes depending on the day.  And last time, it stopped for about 35 minutes with no reason and I had a plane to catch. I am convinced that CTA cannot keep a schedule if they stapled one to their ass three hundred times, and it often gets quite dirty, moldy, and stinky.  I couldn't tell you how many times I rode and saw ridiculous people spitting wads of sunflower seeds on the floor and already saw a cup of pudding spilled and smeared all over a seat before 8am.  Friggin pudding on a seat before 8?  What the hell is that about?  Oh and you gotta love those panhandlers with the shell game claiming to be from the CTA recreational department.  Meanwhile they keep raising the prices."
466,3,"Mar 25, 2006","The CTA has suffered from funding issues and image problems in the past, but they are working hard to fix their budget and route issues. Overall, I'm fairly pleased with the public transportation system: it thoroughly blankets the city, and you are rarely more than a couple blocks' walk from a bus or train line. During rush hour, the red line is a bit notorious for running slow. There are certainly some colorful weirdos on the train lines (there seems to be less weird people on the buses, but they exist in both places) - share your nutty CTA stories at www.ctatattler.com - but coming from a part of the country where there was no public transportation, I really like the ""L"". Most of the time I feel pretty safe using it, but, like any big city public transit system, you should use common sense and safety measures, especially later at night. The best value, due to the new raise in fares ($2 for cash fare) is the CTA card, which looks like a credit card, but you pre-load it online, and using it gives you the old fare cost of $1.75. For more info see www.yourcta.com."
467,2,"Aug 16, 2009","The first thing I noticed when riding the CTA buses and trains is that they are far cleaner than in most cities.  Nonetheless, there is a large room for improvement when it comes to the convenience and promptness of the transportation.  If you're waiting at a bus stop for the 146, 147, and 151 for instance, you may see five 151 buses, and three 147 buses before you ever get the 146.  It can be very aggravating.  Also, it would be nicer if they had more train lines.  In most cases, you have to take 2 buses to get to your destination in terrible Chicago traffic.  Fact is, the train stops are scarce and in order to make transfers you have to go downtown to the Loop, which can be very inconvenient.  Also, you can wait on a station at the Loop that serves 4 different lines and never know when your train will get there.On the bright side, the bus drivers are very friendly for city employees.  I've been on buses in many major cities in the US and Latin American countries and Chicago has the friendliest drivers by far."
468,5,"Aug 20, 2006","in LA, public transportation is nonexistant because everyone drives. in the bay area you have BART, but in my case, you have to drive 20 mintues to the BART station in order to use it. so count your blessing chicago because CTA is amazing! it isnt New York's subway system, but it's a close second! it's easier to use since all the lines are determined by color. but unfortunately, you cant go everywhere. yes, its crowded, comes when it pleases, and smells like a big orgy, but it serves wonders. you get to wind through tall buildings and peep into peoples' rooms while on your way to work. and the ride is quite beautiful going through the loop at dusk/sunset. great photo opportunities!"
469,1,"Jul 21, 2009","WARNING to tourists from the suburbs who want to be ""green"" and take public transportation:  the ""Museum Campus"" bus, number 130, which goes from the two suburban rail stations (Union and Ogilvie) to Shedd Aquarium, Field Museum, and Adler Planetarium and back STOP RUNNING BEFORE THE MUSEUMS CLOSE.  This is ridiculous, but true.  We exited the Shedd Fri., July 16 when it closed at 6 p.m. and made our way to the bus stop.  The sign says the #130 runs until ""late afternoon.""  Why? It makes no sense not to serve the crowds until 6:30.  We were not alone in being stranded there, and the out-of-towners were not impressed with Chicago's hospitality!  We had to take the #146 bus, the only option, which took us north on State Street, then walk east to the station.  Of course, we missed the train we'd planned to take.  But, RTA is much better scheduled, so we had only to wait for the next train."
470,3,"Sep 1, 2014","We rode the L, the METRA, and the bus. All in all it was OK, but is certainly not quite on par with other large US cities we've been to. The homeless guy urinating on one subway stairs we were walking up kind of took the glitter away from the riding experience."
473,5,"Jul 28, 2009",chicago's cta provides buses and trains that get you where you need to go.  they have ample amount of coverage throughout the city where you do not need a car to get around.
474,4,"Dec 11, 2007","Most days I love the CTA. I don't have a car and it's the only way I have to get around town (besides cabs which are super expensive and generally life threatening).  There are a lot of problems, esp with regards to funding, but I believe they are doing the best they can. The renovated brown line stations are very nice and the closures are only mildly inconvenient (I now take a bus or 2 instead). The worst time is during peak hours, but during the off hours I have no problems. The bus drivers are nice, generally on time (within 5 minutes most days) and most are helpful. They have to deal with unruly customers, bad drivers on the road, and getting yelled at by the people who check to see if they are running on time. (I realize 'bus bunching' is bad but so is someone stopping you, yelling at you because your schedule is off, then having your customers get off and transfer to another bus so you can sit there and get back on schedule). I come from a much smaller city with a much more unreliable bus system (despite better funding) so I'll take the CTA any day :) (besides $75/month for unlimited trains and buses beats $250/month just to park a car in the garage)."
475,2,"Mar 19, 2010","For when you can find a good seat it's OK, But when you have to stand at many times, It can be a hassle. Many times the employees can be less than cordial & The bureaucracy overcharges for it's less-than-average service & upkeep. But many times can be convienient."
476,5,"Apr 25, 2013","The CTA is Great. It`s One of the Oldest in the country (The L) and they have been adding New Cars and Busses at a Great Pace. They have repaired 35% of the track in slow zones and continue to and they are replacing the OLDEST stations with Brand new ones that have escalators, Elevators, some stores and alot more. Pretty cool to have the History of the ""L"" but with all the new Equipment and Stations."
477,4,"Jul 24, 2014","I have been an avid rider of the CTA for many years and I have seen a lot on the trains and buses. What I have an issue is the constant complaining people are doing about VENTRA. Yes they're having to still work out bugs in the system, but there's no reason for people complaining about CTA changing to a new fare payment system. Chicago is not the only city most of the major cities with actively used public transportation systems are upgrading to more current payment methods. I like how you can use your debit or credit card to put money on your VENTRA card. What I have a problem with is the fact that people are confused still as to what to do when they're putting money on the card and creating long lines. I am glad they changed the system it shows that CTA is keeping current with technology. People however were informed of this change more than two years ago and were given ample time to prepare for this and to know that stations were to begin removing the transit card machines. Another issue CTA has is overpacking the buses and trains because they keep packing train cars and buses after it's reached maximum capacity and it's not safe to have them like this. They also need to have posted notices informing those who travel with strollers to fold these things up so it frees up space for other passengers to sit down or stand comfortably, CTA also needs to rid the subways of the homeless and mentally ill  who take up residence there harassing customers waiting on the train. Some stations could be a little cleaner. Overall service is pretty decent."
478,1,"Jun 28, 2013","OK,  today is the blackhawks rally in downtown.  Projected 2 million people.  One would think that the CTA would run a ""special"" schedule (More trains?) to handle the additional people.  On my way to work.  Got to my Orange line platform at 8:08am.  First train was jammed, second as well.  Train platform was full of people and more getting off buses and on the escalators.  The CTA complains about how they don't have enough money for operations.  How about running the system better that what you have been doing up to this point?  The CTA acts like a person on welfare, I am handed money I have no reason to improve myself.  Try running with no gov't money and see how long you can last.  Time to get my bike working again."
479,1,"Oct 28, 2013",Ventra is the biggest scam. I hate you CTA
480,4,"Oct 3, 2013","I stopped by here earlier today b/c my Chicago card expired and I had a balance left that I needed to transfer.  Ideally, I would have transferred it to a Ventra card but I was unable to do that at this location.  All they could do was transfer the balance onto another Chicago card which is fine because I only have $13 left and I'll easily use it before the obsolete date of Nov 15.  My ventra card should be mailed and I then can load it as I wish.  I gave this branch of our government a 4 star rating because the employees were terrific and kind and nice.  I know it's a hard job dealing with the public but they showed patience and understanding which is worth noting and publishing.  The office is located on the corner of Lake and Des Plaines (I believe) or near there.  I know it's 567 Lake.  There's some street parking.  I was able to find a spot next to the Starbucks.  I don't know how the Ventra transition/employees will be.  They were located in the RTA building and I did not go there today.  Maybe in the future is something comes up with my Ventra card.  For the record, I will miss my Chicago card."
481,1,"Feb 19, 2014",The CTA is unreliable and slow.  Buses are crowded and the whole experience is terrible every time I ride the bus.  Bus drivers seem patient but it is just a real hassle and the buses never come at a consistent rate of time.  Walking generally is the best way to get around in the city.  If you ride the bus and want to get to work on time you should leave yourself plenty of cushion time because chances are you will be late wherever you are going.
482,3,"Jul 6, 2013","If you are going to a city with public transportation, you should use its public transportation. Not only is public transportation an easy system to figure out (hint: they're pretty much all the same, you only have to ""figure it out"" once, plus they're cheaper and generally more convenient than driving), hotels are less expensive the farther out of a city you stay (financial incentive!). Compared to New York's public transportation, Chicago's is definitely cleaner, and the announcements/general catering to the laymen public is much more prevalent. The system is more or less intuitive, although as a consumer of the MTA I am used to the ""swipe card"" system, and Chicago's ""input card"" system took me a second to figure out. Chalk it up to user error rather than an inherent flaw in the system itself. We are creatures of habit, after all. Regardless, if you are traveling to Chicago I would fully recommend that you take ten minutes extra and learn the public transportation system, and then use it. You will save so much time in the end, and think of all the extra site-seeing you will do!"

In Suburban Station in Philadelphia, I get all manner of hints and tips and good old-fashioned (but the most recently printed) paper maps and schedules for dealing with the more popular suburban routes.Before the pandemic, I used to be able to get some maps in the bookstore in the University City Shops at Penn Barnes and Noble/University of Pennsylvania Bookstore. Took up residence here a whole season before the onset of the pandemic. Yeah, nobody I knew here had the time or even the curiosity or inclination to just show me the lay of the land--moreover, they did not use public transit; except traveling in little groups where they did not have to always navigate (suburban matinee theatergoer or flower show special event dowager type, if they even deigned to staycate instead of leave town).  So I just had kept getting lost -delivery drivers kept me on watch, it had been BAD- because I do not do well with GPS; and people are on their earpods/earbuds and unfriendly sometimes; though to this day I need an excuse to talk to strangers...May as well be strangers with maps!"

She got in the line with her bike and payed the ticket fee to one Septa ticket person.  We wait the a good 20 minutes.  The train was supposed to be there at 6:55.  The train finally arrives and Hana since she has her bike asks to take the elevator.  She goes down the elevator and the train is already rolling away.  I'd also like to point out the Septa workers weren't letting her go to the elevator until the train arrived.So we waited all that time and  that train driver couldn't wait a good 1 minute or two?

Not going to lie, between all the crime and bad news lately, it was a bit nerve wracking, even though it was only 7:00 AM when I arrived, and on the way home it was about 7:00 PM.As a solo female traveler, I was very wary.  Everything smelled like bodily functions.  On the plus side, it was $2.50 each way for a couple of stops."

For example, for the past 20+ years, I've lived out west where public transportation wasn't really viable in the areas that I lived in.  Now I'm back to working in Philly and just recently, for the first time in my life, I used a Septa bus to get from Point A to Point B. Now don't get me wrong, I went up 11th St. to Reading Terminal and then turned around and went down 12th St. to get back to my office on a bus.  You would have thought I ran a freaking marathon, I was so proud of myself.My co-worker helped me and told me where to purchase the bus tokens and exactly which side of the street to stand on to catch the buses (I tell you, I was NERVOUS! What if I got on the wrong bus?  What if a bus never came? LOL).  Anyway, it was easy as pie - it wasn't crowded, I got a seat, I pulled the yellow cord halfway up the block before I needed to get off, yippee.I hope everyone's first time on public bus transportation goes as smoothly as mine did."

This needs to be addressed from the top down, because the idiots at the top of the trash heap dumpster fire are they ones over paid and responsible for this crappy service. And who is the idiot in charge of the IT department that can't fix this app that a average middle schooler could have developed and made a better product."

The airport train was reasonably efficient, but had an extra charge, albeit not as outrageous as at some cities. The different trains were poorly integrated, and one had to walk from one station to another in some instances. The light rail wasn't working when I tried and a bus was running instead, but not on time. A train station closed me out before the last train of the day. The system was old, and the stations dirty. I wished I hadn't spent the money on day passes and instead had just gotten and airport ticket and walked. As a visitor who went multiple places that were very much on the train lines, they just weren't that helpful to me.Additionally, the card they have was quite strange and seemed set up as a quasi debit card, which is not what I'm looking for. If anything, I would want them to simply accept payments directly as some of the more advanced payment systems do, but this seems like an explicit step away from that."
13,1,"Oct 7, 2023",I have traveled in many cities. SEPTA is the absolute poorest public travel scheme that I have ever seen. Wasted tax dollars in the biggest of ways!!!!!

For about 4 months now I have been trying to get this problem resolved and only get recitations of a rule book or procedures manual or ignored completely by SEPTA.

I never have this issue coming back from Trenton but going to? I can safely assume the driver will pass by me and I have to Uber to work. You need to fire these people.

32,1,"Jun 28, 2023","Sometimes I take bus number 17 with my toddler daughter. Often, bus drivers depart even though they know the baby is not seated yet. Sometimes, they even leave at the bus stop while I'm trying to hold the baby and get on the bus together. Moreover, they are frequently not punctual. Unfortunately, the majority of drivers (9 out of 10) are far from being nice or polite, with only a few exceptions."

I have never seen a Cop on the el but get off at 15 market and see at least 10 . Is just ridiculous and unfair that I use it to commute back-and-forth to work I don't feel safe I don't even wanna sit down because the chairs are so filthy. They leave these dirty people on the train and it just makes the train smell so bad it's just unfair that I'm a paying customer and I constantly have to do with unsafe conditions.

Luckily I have a small vehicle. I don't know what Cracker Jack box the Septa drivers get their license from, more caution should be required! Maybe the driver needs to take a refresher course on driving etiquette it's not safe to be behind the wheel of something that large and drive it like you're in a bumper car. I understand that the roads are bad often times people swerve around them but you're in a bus!!!"
38,1,"Jan 22, 2023",One of the worst train service. They are not following their own schedule at all. Even on weekends they are following weekdays schedule. Everyone who look at the weekend schedule on app they needs to wait at least 45 minutes on station for the train. When I told this to septa - 723 crew member he says that we are following weekend schedule even though I was showing him the septa schedule on the septa application. The same happened multiple times that I lost my connecting train because of SEPTA's worst train schedule. I wish if I could rate them in minus stars because that's what they deserves.
39,3,"Dec 27, 2022",I use septa trains all the time and they are great and convenient but the ticketing system is a mess. The transition from selling tickets on the trains to requiring them be purchased before hand as well as the addition to turnstiles has not been a smooth one. These changes have never been communicated to travelers coming into the city from the suburbs therefore causing lots of unnecessary confusion. It's especially confusing for those that purchase quick trip tickets since you not only need your ticket to get on the train but also get off (something else that has never been communicated to travelers).
40,1,"Feb 2, 2022","Septa has always been horrible. Now here we are 2021 and SEPTA has been around for years so you would think they wouldve gotten better, NOT! They are the worst transportation system I have ever used. This new card system is the worst. They are unreliable, trains are dirty, unsafe drug/homeless infested, SPD is a joke and not to mention the employees. They are soooo rude and disrespectful. It's like for some reason they think they are better than people that uses SEPTA. You can't even ask them a simple question without getting an attitude in return. SEPTA needs to be demolished. The city doesn't need them, they aren't a convenience. I'm Sure this city will be ok without them, we do just fine when they leave the city stranded to go on strike. If they weren't around anymore people would make out fine in due time. I HATE SEPTA!!!!! I'm just about to stop using them altogether"
41,3,"Dec 26, 2017","I'd much rather ride the Septa than hang out in a Septic Tank, but that's just me.This station is directly across from Pops Water Ice in the heart of Old South Philly. It's pretty safe here but at the same time be careful if you're by yourself, especially when it's late night."
44,1,"Dec 29, 2021","I gave 1 star because I had to, septa is never on time and ots never their fault. The el cars are FILTHY the platform at FTC is even worse, piss everywhere and all you see is people walking around woth brooms, that's not cleaning. Trying to get an el car that isn't a safe injection site or a moving homeless shelter is job in itself.  I've watched the ""cleaning"" crew during COVID and they were cleaning the polls with a filthy dish towel no cleaning solution on them so they were basically cross contaminating every inch of the el car, there's used needles everywhere, let's not get into not one septa police officer around, you're told to text the septa cops  um sure excuse me Mr mcstabby can you not stab me yet I gotta text the cops ‍ they hired unarmed security guards which are useless.

47,1,"Sep 26, 2022","The Philadelphia public transit system so more than garbage,let me explain. The bus drivers are the worst they act like they don't want to do their job. Now I understand people can be horrible to the drivers, but when you have to be to work at a certain time and you make sure you are at the stop early more than likely you will be waiting a full half an hour for the bus to show. This is true for routes 104, 110 . There has not been a day this week or any other that these two routes are going to be delayed. DO BETTER! Although I know  they won't."
48,3,"May 14, 2017","Even for a transit nerd it's difficult to come up with a Septa rating. How many points to deduct for the foul-smelling, dystopian walkways? Or a user-unfriendly fare system that refuses to provide even the basic conveniences like card-dispensing machines that have been around for years in supposedly anti-transit spots like San Diego?But the subway itself isn't terrible. I may have been stared at once or twice but I can't recall a single instance of anyone shouting threats at fellow riders, which has happened several times in LA. The regional rail has taken me to concerts in Ardmore and Glenside and a sightseeing walk in Wilmington. The buses are adequate and I've been pleasantly surprised to see them in South Philly on tiny streets where they almost don't fit.Septa has allowed me to consume 80,000 calories of cheese steaks and pork sandwiches without using a car."
49,1,"Jul 1, 2022","I lived in a few big cities. No other transit system is as bad as septa. Incredibly grumpy employees ( but hey, that's Philly). Late services. Just generally crap."
50,1,"May 25, 2022","Absolutely, the worst public transit I have ever encountered. I highly recommend moving to a city with more reliable transit. You will wait for hours before a trolley shows up. The septa schedule is a joke so don't bother learning it because they don't abide by it."
51,4,"Mar 25, 2022","I travel between on the SEPTA regional rail between Germantown and Center City. It's convenient, easy and efficient. The station I travel from/to most is Wayne Junction. It was renovated not too long ago and is reasonably clean and in good repair, if not exactly aesthetically uplifting. The trains I take (there are several to choose from when boarding at Wayne Junction) tend to be a few minutes off, but in my nearly six months of five-day-a-week commuting I've only been late to work once. (My Key Card is refilled automatically and I haven't yet figured out how much a one-way peak ticket costs, so I won't comment on the fare, but it is handy to have the automatic-refill feature and not to have to have cash on-hand.)  Sometimes the conductors are friendly and upbeat, often they appear indifferent/uncommunicative (but, with everyone wearing headphones or earbuds and/or glued to their smartphones I suppose one's impulse to be talkative and friendly might be dampened somewhat), and on occasion I've come across a SEPTA worker who is faintly hostile; I actually adjusted my schedule slightly several months ago to avoid having to interact with one such person. What else... Well, on the old trains (and they seem to outnumber the newer ones, at least on the routes I take) there is no information available other than what the conductor elects to impart, and often they elect to be silent. On the newer-model trains the information is displayed on monitors (alongside advertising) as well as announced in a computerized voice, which means you  are spared the regional dialect/disinclination to articulate, emanating from speakers that distort, but sometimes the details on the monitors/computerized voice announcement are not correctly synched and will announce, for example, that you're approaching a station that was actually a couple stops back. What's more, the information on the app, on the signs at the stations and on the exterior of the train tends to be inconsistent, which can be quite confusing for someone who's trying to figure out an unfamiliar route. It will go something like this: on the app it will say ""Airport,"" on the sign at the station it will say ""Newark,"" and on the exterior of the train it will say ""Center City."" So apparently the only way to be sure is to go by the train number. Here's a parting thought: Maybe, now that the pandemic seems to be, well, not so acute at the moment, the conductors could encourage people to use all the seats. As it is now, two people will sit in one of those three-seat rows, but often the two-seat rows will have only one person in them, and that person will place their backpack or purse or luggage on the empty seat. If people no longer are required to ""social-distance"" it might be a good idea to remind passengers to be courteous."
52,1,"Apr 21, 2021","A disgrace for such a great city. I have been taking regional rail 5 days a week for years now. Only continues to get worse. Poor reliability and frequent delays are only the start. Employees are rude to passengers. Mask mandates are poorly enforced, even many ""conductors"" cannot seem to figure out how to cover their noses. You find conductors sleeping, eating, leaving doors open, hanging out of doors on moving trains, arbitrarily making their own rules, and harassing passengers on a regular basis. Regional rail really needs to be fixed, and it starts with hiring the right people and letting the wrong people go."
53,1,"Jan 2, 2022","Literally the worst public transportation service in the entire world. Trains busses trolleys regional rails are all DISGUSTING! Recks of urine and shit. Trash everywhere homeless people literally live on the train with their bags and whatever they own taking up all the seats. Drug users shoot up and overdose on trains or fall onto tracks causing delays on top current delays. You're bound to be robbed, raped, or assaulted and septa police are never anywhere to be found. The drivers are so ignorant and miserable. They have no information about routes or their job in general. They are so rude for people who deal with the general public. None of the routes are never on time or never show up at all. You're lucky if you get an older drive and ride that same route everyday they'll wait for you but other than that your SOL. They raise the fair every 2 years anywhere from 2-5 dollars. They implemented a fare card which also wasn't clearly thought through. You have to pay $5 for the card or load it with money. If you don't have enough on the card and use it they'll let you over draft it then you can't use it until you pay the overdraft. If you lose the card or it's stolen you have to pay an additional $5 to get a new one. You can only get a card from major septa stops such as 69th st city hall or Frankfort, if they even have any windows open to purchase one. The machines they have at other local stops are always out of order or malfunction and take your money without giving you the fair you purchase and they don't even care. When the pandemic occurred I had $200 on my fare card. They didn't even give me the money back. Told me I had to mail in a claim wait for septa to review the claim and then wait for them to send me a check in the mail just to get my money back. They consistently go on strike leaving the city in shambles because that's the only form of public transportation, even lord doesn't know how long the strike will be and they still won't refund you your money that is on your fare card so if you purchase a transpass while their on strike you wasted $25.50 yes 25.50 for a weekly pass gone to waste and no one cares. If you can save yourself the headache learn how to drive catch Uber or Lyft. Septa is trash and needs to be shutdown."

57,1,"Oct 13, 2019","Septa sucks. They always have and they always will. My list of complaints go all the way back to my teen age years when  I had to rally for rides to school because of their strikes. They certainly didn't mind inconveniencing an entire city so why should I be surprised when on the night of this year's Ye Shi Chinatown Night Market the number 48 bus detoured and didn't bother to inform the public. The bus driver going down didn't mention it, there was no sign at any of the stops along the way and if that would have been just too much of a foot effort perhaps someone at a desk with a computer could have put an alert up on the website. The supreme worst."
58,2,"Aug 21, 2022",philly needs to fix this whole purchase a card to get in and out of the paoli thorn dale regional rail. either put the payments on a smart phone app or don't require me to purchase a card that you guys barely sell. every kiosk was broken!!! I tried to use that first and failed and waiting in a second line to purchase a ticket would have taken 20 minutes at minimum! So  wait 40 minutes to get a key pass?!? lmao what a joke this process should take less than 10 minutes to pay for public transit
59,2,"Feb 12, 2022","Recently I started commuting by bus to work. I ride the L bus to Plymouth meeting mall. I get on, greet the driver, pay with cash and I'm met with impatience and arrogance in response. The bus typically arrives on time. That is why I gave 2 stars instead of one. I think the response is due to me not using a key card. I do not plan to purchase one at this time. I'm given the option to pay with cash, so all though it takes a few more seconds to pay my fair, my money is acceptable."
60,1,"May 29, 2019","Awful awful awful.  I have been in many cities with a comprehensive transit system.  This one is barely that.  They have Regional Rail, trains, trolleys, and buses.  The transit map is like a mush of all of those; it is very difficult to come up with a best route, even with Google Maps.  And even if you do, it usually starts with a trolley or bus, and you first have to find a place to buy a pass or have exact cash for a one way ride on the trolley or bus, then spend more money on the pass.And their fares are whacked.  I bought what I thought was a one-day pass for SEPTA.  That was the Convenience Pass, and it didn't include Regional Rail.  The Independence Pass includes Regional Rail.  I would say do your homework, but I did that and still couldn't figure it out.It is also a bit unclear how you are supposed to get the trolleys to stop and pick you up.  Buses make more sense, but even there the signs for the stops are difficult to see.I can't believe I am saying this, but you might want to have transit as a backup only in Philadelphia until you've gotten a better sense of it.  Once they have ticket machines at all of the stations that help you pick the right ticket based on your transit usage for the day, I will be more committed."
61,1,"Dec 30, 2021",HORRIBLE service. Key cards don't work buses are always late and now always canceled without notice! It's a shame that this is the only service we have to rely on. There service is bad and always want to raise the fare!
62,1,"Apr 1, 2021","At the bright young age of 24, I have come to accept I will live my life disappointed with inefficiencies that the world offers. Today, that inefficiency is Septa transportation.             I started my trip to see my cousin nothing short of optimistic. I had a great workout on my girlfriends mother's peloton, had a great shower, my girlfriend had just picked out my clothes and dressed me nicely, I had no complaints in the world. I arrived at the train station, and it was completely vacant. Is there anyone I can talk to about how these magical trains run? They don't exist in Nashville. I sit in the parking lot for 10 minutes, optimism still pretty high.               The train finally comes 6 minutes late, and an unkind middle aged obese white male (the worst kind of white male for the ""woke leftists"" out there) opens the train doors and yells ""CASH ONLY OR KEY CARD"" I kindly explain I do not have cash or a key, no signs identified it was cash only or key, and the younger generations do not run on cash. He yelled out ""SORRY BUD, if you don't have cash or key you can't hop on board!"" And kept the train moving.               Back to my original statement: ""I have come to accept I will live my life disappointed with inefficiencies that the world offers""               How would this system improve, a ""scholar"" or ""expert"" may ask?              1) have a train station Venmo, cash app, zelle, Bitcoin, gofundme, onlyfans, whatever source available to give money. You cannot expect to operate like it is 1990, the world is constantly adapting. As a business or human, it is your job to analyze the adaptation and make it advantageous to yourself. This man and this business failed.               2) if idea 1 is too rational, have signs EVERYWHERE saying ""CASH ONLY"".               2a) if you are going with idea two (a worse idea, but better than no idea) , have on speakers ""CASH OR KEY CARD ONLY"" every minute and have an ATM and key card machine at every train station. Even if it's a robbery ATM (every ATM that wants $3 or more is a robbery ATM) it's better than no ATM.                3) have a square card that you can swipe with, if many Uber drivers can obtain the $49 square card how in the world can you not?                4) technology is the future, either ""hop on board, Venmo, cash, credit card and onlyfans accepted!"" or die a slow painful death. And BAD news septa, you don't get the nice death our ancestors got when you failed to successfully hunt or gather food and the whole family starved. Today, it is often a 30-50 year process of slow degeneration, loss of value, loss of reputation, and then best case, being bought out by someone intelligent who could run the business successfully, and worst case, you go bankrupt and board up the windows and sell the property to mice, bugs, and dust. YOUR CALL SEPTA! You can't say I didn't warn you"
63,2,"Apr 26, 2018","Probably the most confusing subway line that I have ever used in the world. The only positive is that the workers do try to help and don't treat tourists like shit. I guess I have 1 more positive, it doesn't smell that much like urine. The stations are confusing if you are transferring lines and they don't have a thingie you can see which tells you when the next train will arrive. Prices are high imo as well. $9 for a one day pass but it is not unlimited (only 8 trips...no reason why), and it isn't 24 hours (say from 11am-11am the next day) but calendar day which is frustrating. The airport train (despite being using it) doesn't leave as frequently as I would have liked. Honestly even if you are a solo traveler, I think Uber would end up saving you time and a headache. Because I spent my first day using public transport only, I missed out doing something I had planned on going for the day."

Tonight the Lansdale line, formerly R5, insisted he was right so loudly he proved himself wrong on so many levels.

This company makes no decisions with the customer's best interests in mind. In fact, some of their protocol may lead one to believe that SEPTA really doesn't want anyone to ride their vehicles. They can't go a solid week without mechanical breakdowns, manpower issues, signal or switch issues. They can't make it through one entire contract length without the threat or an actual strike, leaving everyone stranded while their operators kick and scream to get what they think they're worth. And now, with the SEPTA Key feature (a prepaid fare card that was obsolete on the day they broke ground on it), all early adopter cards will expire in July and guess what happens? Nothing! You lose your card and your way to work unless you go to a SEPTA key kiosk and BUY a new card, THEN go to a full service SEPTA key counter (wherever they are[?], they are usually closed when you're available to visit) so that you can transfer to a whole new account, THEN you have to realign whatever financial source you had directly depositing into your FSA account.

The buses are constantly late and if they're not late then they either don't show up at all and occasionally are too early compared to the scheduled time that you miss it anyway. It is so unreliable. If you need to get somewhere at a scheduled time plan on being late since you never know when they're actually going to show up. The worst city transportation
77,2,"May 19, 2018","The employees are average to slightly better than average in attitude. It's what you'd expect when you think of Philly.The biggest negatives are for a city the size of Philadelphia, two subway lines is substandard. Somewhere along the line, someone dropped the ball here. Compatible cities have twice as many lines. Over reliance on buses only creates more traffic on the city's narrow and old streets. Not to mention more than half the time, buses are not just a few minutes late, but in  many cases so late that it causes missed connections and frustration. Many times, I've been able to walk faster than the buses!The street car lines are a patchwork of forgotten dreams. Regional rail, in particular, the airport line runs only every 30 minutes and is nearly always full. PHL is a major hub that needs more frequent service.Connecting tunnels and stops in center city are a mess with few signs. Some transfers are free. Others are not with no other reason than someone didn't bother to build the appropriate tunnel.We needn't compare SEPTA to far superior systems in Europe or Japan. We only need to look at places like Portland, Oregon with 3, soon to be 4 light rail lines, a robust street car and bus system. In many cases, unlike Philly, these are green connected to either natural gas or electric lines. All of this, and Portland is half the size of Philadelphia!Improvements are being made, but nothing significant that will bring the service into the 21st century. Right now, they are struggling to get into the 1990s."

Because our local station doesn't have a ticket booth or ticket machine, customer service said we could buy the pass on the train.  The conductor then said we cannot buy the ticket on the train and must do it it at the station, and perhaps the agent at our destination could discount our return fare.   At Jefferson station, the agent said she could only give us a $1.50 discount per ticket off the full fare round trip price.    Her response was that we had to buy the family independence pass in Philadelphia (?!?) to use at a later date - in order to get into Philadelphia.    This is completely crazy, and in fact would have cost us less money to drive into the city.   It was a very disappointing experience."

They only use 2 cars instead of the whole train .  Better off on Amtrak getting to 30th St.
89,1,"Aug 24, 2018",This is the stupid and slowest trains I had ever seen ... I don't why they run so much slow ... it's stupid... people are paying money but here it's wasting time...trains look very clean and good but it takes so much time to reach from 1 station to other and just stops wherever and whenever doesn't even move for so much time
90,1,"Aug 12, 2017","Terrible, always either late, too early, or doesn't come at all with no warning! Unfortunately they have a monopoly on public transit so they can do things like raise the fare without warning, be rude to customers, and make it impossible to get to work safely and on time."

Called the SEPTA office- the $2.50 did appear on my credit card as going through and being charged.  SEPTA RESPONSE: "" GO back to the stop where it happened get a machine ID number submit a inquiry by mail"". So, no- im not willing to spend $2.50 to go back to that spot plus $2.50 to return to maybe get my own $2.50 back? Thats a $7.50 investment to try to return my own $2.50- i don't work for SEPTA.

96,1,"Feb 1, 2017","This company doesn't even deserve 1 star but anyways, I've been taking the regional rail everyday for the past 4 years because it's my only way into the city. The trains are always late sometimes by 5 or 30 minutes or even an hour late. Sometimes they even just cancel trains all together. It's completely unorganized, the trains always have ""maintenance or equipment problems"" & good luck if you're trying to take it in the winter. I cannot emphasize enough how consistently late the trains are. It's horrible, frustrating & God forbid that it's important that you need to be somewhere on time of you have to take SETPA transportation.I took the NJ Transit regional tail to New York every day during the summer & sometimes in the fall and winter & NEVER did I have the same severe issues I had with SEPTA. BY THE WAY, not only are they always late & unreliable, when they go on strike (which happens more than it ever should) it's a DISASTER. The whole city practically shuts down, nothing is running & if it is, it's completely packed and unsurprisingly late. & then they refuse to give you your money back for a weekly or monthly pass."
97,3,"Jan 2, 2019","I am a regular SEPTA user as I travel via regional rail 5x a week. While the usual public transposition delays/issues occur a event happened that is worth mentioning. Recently I forgot my wallet on the train during my morning commute. Throughout my process of trying to locate it I interacted with various SEPTA personnel. I was helped by the staff at the University City station gate on South Street, main station entrance and those working in the booth. I also talked to the Suburban Station information desk staff and those in the passenger office at lost and found in person as well as on the phone. My call was answered in a timely matter. While this was a stressful time for me every single one of the staff were kind, patient and helpful! I received various suggestions and information as to where I could most likely find my wallet. After being directed to fill out a lost item form at suburban I was called that same evening that my wallet had been found by a conductor. I wanted to thank each person and SEPTA as a whole for their help and reassurance throughout this process!I was truly impressed by your costumer service."
98,1,"Aug 20, 2018","Beware SEPTA's ""improved"" fare system!  SEPTA is in the process of rolling out bits and pieces of its ""new, better"" farecard system called The Key. If you're a regular commuter it's fine - you no longer have to carry tokens and change. But if you're a visitor or occasional rider, FUGEDDABOUDIT!  It's as if the so-called planners who put the Key system together managed to find everything they could to make its use inconvenient and expensive for anyone who isn't riding 9-5 on Monday to Friday.- If you don't have a Key card, you have to pay an extra 50¢ when boarding a bus or trolley. On the train system, you have to pay anywhere from $1.25 to $1.75 extra. On top of that, without a Key card you don't get a break if your trip requires transferring to a second vehicle - you have to pay a full fare for each transfer. So why not just get a Key card, you ask? Hey, this is SEPTA! Key cards are only available at certain locations, and there's a $4.95 fee to buy the card. Yeah, you get the $4.95 back as a fare credit if you go online and register your card but how many tourists will be returning to Philly in time to make use of the credit?  - It's at least possible to buy single-ride tickets (at the higher, surcharged rate, of course) from vending machines at maybe half of the subway stations. At the others, you need to have exact change to board. Yes there are ticket-booth attendants but they're NOT ALLOWED TO MAKE CHANGE!  Unless you've got the right bills and coins you have to round up to whatever denomination(s) you have in your wallet.  On the commuter train lines about 2/3 of the stations actually have ticket offices staffed by live humans, but the offices are only open limited hours. If the office is closed or non-existent you have to pay in cash on the train - again subject to that $1.25-$1.75 surcharge. - If that's not enough, those shiny new contactless e-pads installed in many stations and on vehicles? They only work with the Key card - credit card or mobile app payments aren't accepted. As a transit advocate it hurts deeply to say this, but if you're a visitor Uber's starting to look pretty good. SEPTA just _might_ be OK if you're only going to use it once in your life. Otherwise, it's simply not worth trying to navigate the rat's nest of fare limits, surcharges and just plain ""gotcha"" rules that the Key has brought on."

The service is expensive and if you forget to buy your monthly pass on the first day of the month, you have to pay an extra ticket on the train (~$6) even if you're buying the monthly pass anyway after that. They won't give you a refund for every time a train is cancelled without previous notice, for every delay. In other words, they can be as bad as a service as they want and you still have to pay... they claim to be the a transit authority... THEY'RE NOT."

I walked over to the man in the front of the train by the door and simply asked what was going on. He had a huge attitude and did not want to provide feedback as to why this was the last stop. I asked him again why we weren't going to Colmar and he said ""you don't want to argue with me, go get on the bus"". He was so rude and unhelpful. This man was so miserable he should not be working around people. His job is to provide helpful instructions especially to passengers!

The ticket counter was a breeze and we boarded (I think it was sometime around 7:50am). Conductor 446430 came by to collect tickets. We were unsure of how the tickets worked, and just handed them to the conductor and asked about the return tickets. The conductor punched the tickets and said there aren't any return tickets. You see he had just punched our return ones also.. A person in our group asked some questions and the conductor raised his voice really loud and said ""calm down""! The person from our group was calm and simply asked for information. In that moment I began to feel uncomfortable. Conductor 446430 proceeds to talk in his raised voice and basically yell that we have disabled tickets. He then turns towards my child and says in an even more rude tone "" I don't know how old these kids are""! After he gave us some papers to correct the error, it still wasn't over. On our way back we found out the papers he gave to correct the mistake stopped in Hamilton and not Trenton from where we boarded. Thanks a lot conductor 446430"
114,2,"Sep 8, 2018","This 2018 Labor Day from  Friday, August 31st until Friday, September 7th my family has used Septa regional rail to travel from Philmont train station to Jefferson train station and return.  To say the experience was unpleasant is indeed an understatement.  Septa does not have enough cars on the trains which results in severe overcrowding and the cars that are being used are not in a good state of repair.  The temperature during this past Labor Day week were in the upper 90's and the air conditioning was not working properly.  On one occasion when returning home from a terrific day at the Kimmel Center the Septa train lost power and we were trapped at North Philadelphia station in the blistering heat.  In my opinion Septa simply does not care and is focused on their bottom line."

The employee wearing a yellow vest and directing the passengers how to ride the train mislead me when I wanted to purchase a ticket. She told me that I won't need one since I am senior. I showed her my Florida Id driving license and she gave me the green light to board the train. Well it was not true. The train employee charged me the cost of the ticket plus a fine for not having purchased the ticket prior to board the train. When I complained, he strongly suggested me to write a letter to the company and ask for a refund. I did it and got a response written by Supervisor Anthony Fl Natale denying the refund. If I only knew it, I won't waste my precious time writing a letter, mailing it and waiting more than one month for a negative response. I won't recommend that public train transport to my friends but ride either Uber or Lyft."

I told her that I was senior from Florida. Onboard the employee charged me the fee plus the fine and suggested me to write a letter to the company's refund department which I did attaching the ticket and explaining the incident. After more than one month, I received a letter with the ticket back denying the refund.  That important transport company which makes the liaison from the airport to the city and vice versa is not reliable and should train better and longer their staff. I would highly recommend the riders not to rely on those standing employees working for the company who would mislead them.

You can forget getting a refund if your train is late.  I can deal with the urine smell in the stairways and the outdated decor, but my god, please train your employees in basic customer service.

I called customer service to complain but I just got some clarity on the matter, had to call twice first true clarity and rush is a discretionary time I learned and the conductor could still say no during any other time. I came prepared with my bike lock just in case this issue came about, I asked twice to let lock it up being as though there are many poles, right where you board at that. I was pulled off on both times even with explaining I was told to wait on the second train, even still asking to just let me lock my bike up. As I turned to lock up both times they shut the doors and rode of, funny thing is I do have a car which is why riding is periodical. Lesson learned the hell with supporting Philadelphia transporting and the jobs of those who are clear a%%holes.

They are ALWAYS late, about 10 times they didn't come at all, when they were supposed to. Later it would turn out that a bus broke in its way or a driver would be new and didn't know where to go. But how are people supposed to know that?? Standing at a bus stop in the rain or snow, how are they supposed to know when even Septa's app doesn't work properly and nothing tells you why a bus is being late or  not coming at all . And how about people who don't have smartphones or have no idea how to use an app? People at customer service are not necessarily helpful every time. What surprises me the most is why not to make busses come every half an hour or at least every hour? Why does the life of those who don't drive has to depend on a bus schedule?

If you do not know North Station than you should know that this station is very involved with tracking people who do not pay- but not with the quality of the service, they provide to customers. Therefore no one can go in the waiting area without a ticket - good thing I believe - and no one can get out from the arriving trains area without scanning the ticket- not a good think. People wait in line in the morning to scan the tickets- scanners do not work well so we all are trap there waiting in long lines. No one care about our time and safety I might say. And all for catching few evaders at the expense of all the rest of us. Does not matter that trains are late, signals problems all the time even thou for years federal money were drawn for so call improvements. Trains are late all the time, and no one cares.But the other day something new happened. No employee was at the 30 or so gates to help customers and be able to buy a ticket. So I went to buy a ticket -one way- at the booth.  Each of the two booths open had a person they already were in a process to finish their transaction, but no one was waiting. So, I start waiting a few feet away from one both- the person at the booth seems that was almost done. Which she was. She left and when I got at the booth the employee refused to sell me ticket under the pretext that I did not wait in line. In the meantime, while I was waiting another person came and now, he was waiting too to buy ticket. I explain her that when I arrived no one was waiting so that person came after me. She did not ask the person if he found me there, but she continue to refuse to sell me a ticket. I did tell her I will lose the train which- thanks to MBTA is only one every hour- and she continue to refuse to sell the ticket and send me back inline which by now there were 3-4 people. Finally, she got my 20$ and give me a ticket. When I checked the ticket, she gave a ticket for a longer trip with the train then I told her I need: actually, the maximum she could charge for that train even if repeatedly I told her I want a ticket for zone 6.When I mention that the change and ticket are not correct and I am not traveling to the end of the line she told me to get them back to her. Which I did and hope she will give me the correct ticket. NO!. She gave me the 20$ back and sent me back in line again. Even If I told her my train will leave in less than 5 minutes, she refused to sell me a ticket. I finally left hoping that I will find an employee at the gate who will sell me a ticket and will not have to wait another 1h for next train. I did find someone which sold me a ticket and I was able to get in time to the train. From train, I did call customer service and complain about this vicious and unprofessional attitude . They told me they will investigate. I guess they still do since 2 weeks pass from even  and had not heard back from them. However, 2 days after event, I saw a supervisor and I asked him about this incident. He knew and he told me they are investigating. They will look at the camera footage. I hope they do. Apparently, this employee told them that I left the booth and come back - which it is not true - lying to justify her appalling behavior."

The problem, however is that the MBTA remains consistent in it's overwhelming mission to make public transportation the worst option for anyone to take.I got on the Roxbury Crossing train at 4:40 PM today and thought I could make it to Malden Center by 5:15 PM, and I could not have been more wrong. It was cutting close, I knew the risks, but I was hopeful the month long shutdown would bring some much needed improvements. After all, it's not like the orange line routinely shut down for sections at a time on weekends over the last decade... anyways - we reached North Station at 5:05 and I was still hopeful I could make my time. By 5:25 we still hadn't made it to Assembly. This is 2 stops after North Station, just to put it into perspective. We may legitimately be moving at 10 mph at most currently. Why waste the time writing a review? Well my friends, I'm actually still on the train right now. It's about 5:40 PM and we still have not arrived at Malden Center. I could have finished all the Lord of the Rings movies by now.Cheers, folks! To another decade of mediocrity from the MBTA."
22,1,"Apr 3, 2019","The MBTA's singular job is to disappoint you on a daily basis. They routinely excel at wasting your time and making you late. They are consistent, I will surely give them that. There has never been a service that shows as much of a disregard for their customers, and it is because they know that 95% of us depend on them and have no other viable option. We were told to get off the train at Wellington and to take a shuttle bus to oak grove. After waiting for ten minutes with no shuttle, we are told that the train is now coming and to get back on. 15 minutes later, the train to oak grove arrives. So we sit on the train and wait, and wait, and wait... and 30 minutes later we finally start to move.In summary, the MBTA is the greatest at being the worst. Knowing that their customers have no other choice, they exploit that fact to provide the worst possible service while still increasing their fares at a regular rate. If I could avoid taking the train ever again, I would be forever grateful. Unfortunately, I must face this nightmarish crapshoot of a service almost every single day."
23,1,"Aug 19, 2023","Comparared to the equivalent trains in SF Bay, NYC, Chicago, MBTA is the worst I have experienced. This includes subways I have experienced in London, Paris, Barcelona, Seoul, Singapore, Shanghai and Tokyo. Worst of all cities listed above. Its unreliable, the passengers can  get noisy, even singing loud with a speaker on.  Happening right now"
24,2,"May 4, 2023",Staff is so rude when you ask a question. Makes you just want to walk so you don't have to get the attitude. Didn't realize people get paid to be rude as a donkey.
25,1,"Jul 22, 2023",When  arrived in Boston 9 years ago it was better.  Now it takes at least one hour to get from Quincy Adams to Downtown Crossing. Today I waited approximately 45 minutes to get from Quincy Adams to Quincy Center. Now I am late to work.  It takes  less time to drive to Providence RI than take the T. I find this absolutely ridiculous. You need to get your act together and provide actual service. People depend on the T. I  think that the cost should be lowered or free until the issues are resolved.
26,1,"Jul 17, 2023",This is an extremely poorly run and fairly incompetent transportation system. They advertise all summer long to switch from car commute to train/subway/bus in order to allow construction on major tunnels in Boston and avoid traffic and yet have major delays on subway lines causing you to miss trains. I've only been commuting via MBTA for three weeks and have already missed two trains due to two separate subway delays (I got on the subway a good 40 minutes before my train left north station and still missed it) and have also had one train cancelled shortly before boarding and another train delayed shortly before boarding. I would rather rot in traffic than take this commuter service and will not be renewing my monthly pass. I shouldn't have to pay almost 400 a month to then pay for an Uber to get me to the north station to catch my train on time because the subway can't stick to a schedule. As I'm writing this my commuter train is sitting at the station 20 minutes late for departure and we've just been asked to deboard and board on another track. The MBTA oozes incompetence.
29,1,"Sep 21, 2023","absolute trash of a company, making me pay for transportation that is unreliable to get to my destinations on time, talking about ""I apologize for the inconvenience"" as if its going to do anything. y'all making us pay for what exactly to be late every time?? especially speaking for the red line."
30,2,"Jun 21, 2023","The mbta is a quick way to get around- except the fact that it's unreliable most of the time. At least one train line is always down or ""being worked on"". This is constantly, so if you need to take a few train lines to get to work every night like myself I wouldn't rely too heavily on this transportation, and since it's the only affordable option to get around in Boston it would be wise to leave at least 15-20 minutes earlier than you usually would for anything"
31,5,"Jan 22, 2023","Cheap. Fast. Convienient. For the cost, MBTAs subways and rail are the best around. Are things dated? Sure. But this is the first damn subway in America. If you also value your life, the MBTA will save you from having to drive on these streets in Mass. Let me tell you guy, the MBTA probably saves as many lives as the local hospitals by taking some of these drivers off the road if you know what I mean."
32,4,"Jun 4, 2022","I actually don't know where I was so I can't mention station name. It was early in the mourning and it wasn't open yet. I guess some stations open at 5am. My day started at 3:00. It was a short walk. There was a couple of people outside waiting to get in. My train was supposed to leave at 4:45am. I remembered that there was another entrance without having to go thru building. So I walk down a little and there it was. I like to use bathrooms before I get on a train cause sometimes there's no bathroom on train. Apparently you are only allowed inside if you're a Amtrak ticket holder. Understandable. But if you share the tracks with another train, in this situation mbta, and I have my ticket. I should be able to use bathroom too. Security was very nice about it, I was allowed to use bathroom."
33,1,"Oct 26, 2022",There is no consistency how those trains running. I'm talking about all green line. Was waiting for my train to Boston over 25 minutes and at the same time 7 trains run to Boston college. Thats insane and mind blowing. And that's just fall. in winter I was waiting over 40 minutes.In the mornings a lot of trains running express to Boston college and tells 'there is a train directly behind us'. It is behind but like 10 minutes away! sometimes two trains can pass by you without any stop!

35,1,"Nov 19, 2022",Every higher-up in MBTA will be burned in hell for the tremendous amount of time they wasted on commuters.
36,4,"Nov 11, 2019","Seeing all the negative reviews, the first thing I am thinking is, why?Sure, the trains are packed, but that is a good thing! That means people are using this system to the fullest, and I mean the fullest!The Boston T (which I predominantly rode everywhere while in Boston) is the oldest subway system in the United States (even older than the New York City subway). It has three subway lines, the Red Line, the Blue Line, and the Orange Line, and one extensive light rail line, the Green Line (which acts like a subway downtown). There is also a commuter rail and a rapid bus service (the Silver Line), but I will be focusing on the T in this review.The T is a first-generation subway, which for those that are unfamiliar, is a subway system that was built before the advancement of the automobile and the interstate highway system. This falls in line with three other subway networks in the United States; the aforementioned New York City Subway, the Chicago ""El"", and the SEPTA Subway. Each of these systems were built with extensive station stops to accommodate large groups inasmuch as there was not a way to do so before the 1940's and 1950's. That is why the train infrastructure is older, the trains more frequent, and stops are closer together. But it also explains why it is better than something say like, Atlanta's MARTA, or Washington, DC's Metro. Those two systems are second-generation subways, or systems built to supplement the automobile, rather than act like one. But back to the T.I really liked the fact that they offer several passes to make it easy to travel without spending a lot of money. The maps are easy to understand, and connections are easy and fluid. If I had to nitpick on one thing I did not like, it was that the turnstiles are often broken, and that presented problems while trying to get into some of the stations. At least there were employees willing to assist at most of the stations where possible.If you come to Boston, definitely do not plan on taking a car everywhere. Traffic stinks, parking is worse. Use the T."
37,4,"Oct 20, 2021","There is a real chasm in the reviews here for MBTA - Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority.  If you look at the source(s) of this, decent reviews seem to be written by out-of-towners and marginal reviews seem to come from the locals.MBTA means you don't need to have a car in Boston.  That seems to hold true for the locals as well as those visiting.  MBTA is often referred to as the ""T,"" especially if referring to its rail routes.  The routing is fairly logical and there are four rail lines:  three of them are heavy rail, meaning they use subway type cars, and one is a trolley type line.  Understanding the lay of the land with respect to the three subway lines is doable while the more trolley-like Green Line can be perplexing.  It fans out from downtown to go to 4 different terminuses, so you will have to pay attention to the train's signage.  (One of the terminuses is Chestnut Hill, which means Boston College.)  The Green Line is obviously also the oldest line in the system.  Once you're done with college - at least undergraduate studies - college kids can be annoying ... and Boston has a lot of colleges!  The good thing is that they are mostly in different places and rail seems to reach many of them - B.U., Boston College, Suffolk, UMass Boston down south, and Harvard and MIT in Cambridge, among others.  Harvard (Square), on the Red Line, is an interesting station where there are always performers and, well, characters.Visually, the system map is somewhat easy to grasp, while that of Washington DC is not so easy to grasp and that of New York City is a hopeless case. Unlike with many other urban transit systems, the rail cars are painted in the color of the line.  That means you'll have blue, red, and orange subway cars and green light rail cars.   Another interesting thing is that, on the subway cars, the seating faces inward, with seats only along the windows, while on the Green Line, the seats are lined up in rows, like one typically sees.All the lines come into downtown Boston.  At several stations, such as Downtown Crossing, Government Center, and State, various lines come through them and seem to be stacked on different levels.  It's as compact as Boston itself and feels very different from, say, MARTA or BART, where suburban stations have big parking lots.MBTA runs the trains, buses, and some ferries.  Commuter trains to further out suburbs use a much different pricing structure and are more expensive.  I've ridden on a few of the buses.  I wouldn't say that the bus drivers were rude, like some people are claiming.  A better word might be crusty.  Crusty doesn't bother me, but rude does.  Of the ferries, the ones a tourist is more likely to use are the ones from downtown to Charlestown, which is how you might return after walking the Freedom Trail instead of doubling back on it, as well as the one from downtown to Boston Logan Airport (BOS).  Also, MBTA runs free normal sized shuttle buses around waterside BOS Airport so you can connect to the water shuttle or to the subway.  BOS actually has an MBTA station called - you guessed it - Airport, on the Blue Line, which is next to the airport instead of in it.  This is commendable because, at Washington-Dulles Airport, rail will be arriving there soon, after about 40 years, and, in NYC, there is no subway to La Guardia Airport and the inexpensive ""milk train"" A train that went all around Brooklyn to Howard Beach in Queens, from which you could take a free shuttle to JFK, is gone and you now use pricey AirTrain to get to JFK via public transit.  So, Boston has the airport smartly connected to the the city center and many key places.For this being Boston, MBTA's fare structure is acceptable.  A single ticket on rail is $ 2.40.  There are also things called Charlie cards (which probably sounds great when said with a New England accent).  The daily card isn't a bargain, but it's easier to go that route than buy individual tickets.  The weekly card, on the other hand, is nicely priced.  It appears that the day or multi-day Charlie cards are not usable on the ferries.  I was told that they were, and then found out otherwise.  Nevertheless, you will want to ride on at least one ferry because the skyline and harbor views are captivating.The MBTA system is a workhorse and it does a lot.  It isn't ridiculously priced and it's convenient, so that's why people pack into it.  But at some times during the day, it has empty seats and it's almost relaxing to ride the subway.  MBTA stands for four words, and I think that, independent of isolated skirmishes, some eccentricities, and an oddity like a pandemic, MBTA is worthy of four stars."
38,4,"Mar 19, 2019","Not to be confused with MBA Boston which if you're lucky will be from Harvard or MIT rather than Boston College or Community College.These old trains in Boston will get you around and pretty close to a lot of the serious action which is an excellent element of them, although they are very old and very run down and they stop running kind of early.I appreciate them, especially in cold weather, but then again Boston is very walkable so I'm not sure how totally necessary they are.It's a great part of the city because a lot of cities bigger than Beantown don't have anything like this. The traffic in Boston is still pretty awful so this is an excellent alternative and if they were just a little bit more modern and less creaky and old then I would give him a higher rating."
41,3,"Nov 11, 2018","Since my review of the MBTA in 2013, I have ridden the metros in Beijing, Istanbul, Madrid, Santiago, Porto and Taipei. All are leaps and bounds better than Boston's system. They are cleaner, they are cheaper, they are more efficient. Yeah, the T is the oldest underground subway in North America. And it shows in quite a few places. Those other lines are newer and they have the advantage of time. So I'll give it to Boston's T for still being here after this long.And since five years ago when I wrote my review of the MBTA, I have been to each and every T station on the entire network from Oak Grove to Forest Hills, from Alewife to Ashmont and from Wonderland to Bowdoin. I've done every station on the Green Line and all the stations on the Mattapan trolley.I have reviewed each of the four lines and linked each of my reviews here:Orange Line - https://www.yelp.com/biz/orange-line-mbta-boston?hrid=x0avV_r4-u-fehjcfZUwiAGreen Line - https://www.yelp.com/biz/green-line-mbta-boston-2?hrid=mqtMTLXKFUzk3f81RqyHewBlue Line - https://www.yelp.com/biz/blue-line-mbta-boston?hrid=2JDh4NQfLSjs_NPMN5KEsQRed Line - https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-line-mbta-boston-2?hrid=1C58mcFBjwFNtxj2vw85IgThe MBTA is overseen by the Massachusetts Department of Transportation (aka MassDOT) and the Fiscal and Management Control Board (FMCB).

And frankly, all of them are easier to navigate and easier to ride than this here Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority.Granted, the Charlie Card is an improvement over the carnet they have in Paris but the London Oyster Card works better. And the Blue Line sure as hell doesn't squeal nearly as much as the Q train as it rides under Manhattan but the Paris system runs on rubber tires. And yes, the London system shuts down at around 1 AM just like Boston but New York runs all night! And hell yes, all of the MBTA is one zone which makes it a heck of a lot easier to work out how much it costs (yes, London is SEVEN fricking zones).But all of those negatives add up to, uh, where was I going with this, a system that sucks. It's better than walking, but that's not saying much."

Needless to say once I played his game and answered his stupid ""how are you"" question he fixed the issue in about 15 seconds.

62,2,"Nov 17, 2020","I have never felt the need to sanitize myself more than after a quick ride on the orange line on the T. The train car looked outdated and smelled of weed and cigarette smoke when we entered it. The interior can definitely use some updating - changing the wood paneling on the walls would go a long way. The seats looked as if the original fabric was still on there and they were filthy and stained. The exterior of the train needs a good power washing to get rid of the layers of stuck on grime and dirt.After this ride, my friend and I walked to a local pharmacy to spray Scrubbing Bubbles on our clothes and we washed our hands like crazy to get rid of all of the germs."

I heard a computer voice say ""please hold"" and I was on hold again for over 20 minutes.  I have a full-time job and other things to manage.  I really cannot tell you how much time I have wasted trying to get help from The Ride.When we have been forced to use them - out of necessity - my disabled Veteran husband sometimes requires rides, when I am not available - they are late to pick-up.  They are horrible about dropping him off in the right location.  If I had other choices, believe me, I would make them.  In fact, I will be using Uber tomorrow, as I cannot get a hold of The RIde (I've been trying since last Thursday) to schedule a simple pick-up @ a location and drop-off @ home.  It's horrible.  If I ever do reach someone at The Ride (please, don't send me to their website, we cannot login to our account because ""it's a new system"" I was told via an email) I am going to ask for a full refund of any money that we may still have on the account.

Constantly Trains on standbys and let's not even talk about how bad his services are. There is so much for them to improve. People won't mind paying for the service but how can they increase price and keep providing mediocre service.
67,1,"Nov 13, 2018","Truly disappointing organization, one of the worst of a major US city.There is lots to be said about the Green and Orange lines which are near constantly plagued with issues during the poor weather months.  Being a northern city, Boston ought to prepare for inclement weather like any other major city, yet it does not. Every winter you can count on multiple trains being out of service every day, causing delays ""up to 15 minutes"" which actually means at minimum 1 hour and probably longer.Today their most modern line, the Blue line, had a signal failure which caused significant delays. They had 1 person on the platform providing no information, did not arrange for shuttle busses to deal with the thousands of commuters they inconvenienced, and knowing their service was down neglected to inform people of this until after they had swiped their card and paid for the ride.Any other business that was run as poorly as the MBTA would have been run out of town on a rail decades ago, but here we are.A major city should have:Multiple T lines which reach most major neighborhoods outside the center of the city.Transit systems which run on time within +-5 minutes of scheduleTransit system that can handle the expected 80-100 inches of snow each year Boston receivesTransit systems which are professionally managed so commuters are kept up to date about delays and screw ups.Boston's MBTA can claim none of these. Its a failed agency and should be auctioned off to a more professional organization, and any who have had a say in its management over the last 2 decanes should be immediately fired and prevented from ever being employed in the public transportation sector in the future.Sincerely,A T'ed off Bostonian"

I did not fight back because I am afraid it could result in more severe accident. After some passengers stop, this AA man stopped. Then the MBTA commuter train conductor started to come. He just asked me to leave this cart and stay in the space between two carts. He left the black man to stay in the card even I was the victim. Then he left me and the black guy at the stop of W Medford and said he called the police. After around a half hour, two policemen came. One is a young white and one is a young Asian/Latino. The white asked me questions and the latino asked this black man. I did not know what the black man answers the questions. The white man simply asked me what was going on and he even said I should not go to the court because it would hard to explain because he said I should fight back even though I did for God's sake. Also, my face was all right since the black man only punched my head back. Then this black man only said sorry to me and then the two policemen left and let the black man and me wait for the next train.

This lady did not say a word accept seeing me pay my fare and I walked to have a sit.This is unprofessional and imprudent of an employee who actually caused this accident and I will follow up with my Dr.

One time I had to direct a driver to riverside after spending two hours driving us around. Trains to riverside are a mess. They never communicate or coordinate to each other in case there is a change of service
79,1,"Aug 26, 2017",This is probably the worst train system a city can offer to its citizens.Ticket stations doesnt work most of the time.There is always something wrong with the trains.Not to mention that it shuts down at 12 30 during the week and 1:30 the lastest on the weekends. No 24 hour service for a city like this?Really?That helps killing the night life in Boston witch is already little to non existant.

83,1,"Oct 23, 2020","To compare the MBTA bus system to that of a 3rd World country would be an insult to 3rd World countries. Pre-COVID you could stand on a corner on any given morning and watch 3 buses on the exact same route roll down the street back to back. No joke, 1 bus would be overflowing with people and the other 2 would be completely empty. Buses show up whenever they want; late, early, whenever the driver gets around to driving their route. If you live outside of Boston, Cambridge or Somerville good luck getting anywhere, and the city complains about all the cars on the road. And it's not like the T or Commuter Rail are much better either. They've clearly got a bunch of jokers running the MBTA."
84,1,"Sep 7, 2017","The buses are BEYOND terrible. This is the sole reason I just use Uber or Lyft from now on. I typically take the 57 & 66 to get around. Both buses are usually delayed, never properly linked together (so you always miss one!) and always overcrowded. Best of luck if you try to use the bus to get to work on time on Saturdays! 66 comes by maybe once an hour.Trains aren't that better either. Usually dirty, smelly, also full. Also, DON'T bother using the online service to add money to your card. Doesn't work typically. Waste of money!"

My train broke down 35 minutes from my destination, I had to get out and get different means of transportation after multiple indefinite delay announcements.  Later, I found out that the train was permanently delayed.  They also have a new policy that if the train breaks down for any reason, mechanical, weather, track issues or if the train never leaves, etc....that THEY DON'T OFFER REFUNDS!!  Unbelievable to think of a company being able to charge for services they DO NOT EVEN PROVIDE, and having a BLANKET NO REFUND POLICY.  I created a claim requesting a refund (only for the ticket price) to help recover some of my rideshare cost, talked to a customer service agent, and even asked to talk to a supervisor which I was promised would call me within 24 hours...Wasn't surprised to never hear from them.Two thumbs down...if this happens to anybody, please just dispute the MBTA charge via your credit card, they will refund you for failure to provide goods promised."

89,3,"Aug 14, 2015","MBTA reminded me of Toronto (TTC) in some ways. The frequencies, in theory, are good for a city of its size, but its execution is quite poor. From a tourist point of view, it does its job in terms of providing information for a tourist to navigate the system, however there were definitely flaws I found in the network.The most noticeable issue was the signaling system. I rode the Red Line into Boston during rush hour, but we were literally inching between Harvard and Park Street to the point it took 20 minutes just for that section. There was also quite a noticeable gap ahead of us (I waited 4 mins for my train at Harvard), so I wasn't sure what the holdup was. The Orange Line, on the other hand, suffered from quite a bit of bunching, with 14 min waits during the height of rush hour, then trains coming in 1-2 min successions.Then there was the Green Line...an excellent idea for a LRT (it's even displayed on the T map for gods sake), but it's way over capacity. Getting on the Green Line at Park Street was like trying to squeeze in a Yamamote train in Shinjuku.I only tried the Washington Street portion of the Silver Line, and similarly there was quite a lot of bunching, with 15-20 min gaps then 3 buses coming at once. I will say though, it's a great idea for the Silver Line to be displayed on the T map, even though it's barely a passable BRT system.Some of the stations were set up quite well, such as the Park Street Red Line platform (Spanish solution), Harvard (wide platforms), and North Station (Orange and Green Lines on the same platform). The ticket machines are quite easy to understand, but don't forget to purchase a free CharlieCard if you want to save money!Overall the MBTA reminds me of the TTC back home. Its frequency and technology (to an extent) are there, but its reliability can be questioned."

91,1,"Oct 19, 2016","I felt very humiliated by a MTBA worker at the Boylston Station today. I was carrying heavy groceries in both hands, tapped my MONTHLY PASS at the entrance, heard the beep but the door did not open. I tapped again but got the ""card already used"" message because MBTA prevents people from sharing the same card. I remembered I was told to or read somewhere that just walk behind someone if this happened(yes, I know I could be totally wrong here). So I followed the next person and got in. This MTBA worker emerged from the a booth looking furious. He immediately start yelling at me for sneaking in without paying. I told him I tapped my card but the door didn't open. He kept saying something in line with ""did you just walk in behind someone?"" I told him again that I tapped the card but door didn't open, and it didn't even matter because I had a monthly pass anyway. However, he continued to act really pissed off and made me walk out of the entrance (I was carrying a lot of groceries on both hands), and threatened to write me a ticket if I was lying. So I had to walk out, but for some unknown reason he pulled out his cellphone and started to make a phone call meanwhile I was standing outside of the gate looking at him. I kept tapping my pass at the door multiple times desperately trying to show him that I had a monthly pass. He looked at me but was still on his phone call (maybe he was calling the police to arrest me). Eventually, he got off the call and opened the gate but still blamed me for not waving at him first. In my defense, first, usually there is no one sitting in the booth at this hour of day. And second, his booth was dim. It was impossible to tell if someone was in there. It seems that he was quick to spot me ""sneaking in"" but too slow to know that I was tapped my card couple of times and the door never opened.Even if it was all my fault for walking in behind someone and even if this was all just a misunderstanding, he didn't have to act so dramatically like a bully and ignored me while I wait outside of the entrance to get in.I felt extremely humiliated and emotional as if I was falsely caught stealing. All the other passengers at Boylston looked me probably thinking I was being caught trying skipping a $2.50 fare. In an ideal world, he should be apologizing to me because MBTA's gates malfunctioned and caused inconvenience for me. Next time when the MBTA door doesn't open, I know I have only these options. 1. Wave at the booth and try to get a MBTA worker's attention even if he was focusing on his cell phone screen, praying he actually raises his head. 2. If there is no one sitting in the booth at the moment or the MBTA worker was too devoted to his/her cellphone, then consider your fare wasted. Go buy another ticket. 3. In my case, since I have a monthly pass, I will have to wait for another 20 mins (10mins? I don't know exactly how long it takes) so my pass can be tapped again. Pray that the gate opens for you this time. Update: although I appreciate the upvotes, I don't find this incident funny( well, maybe a little bit). I'm still mad thinking about it now. Every time I walked into Boylston and saw that booth, this incident came back to me. It's like having PTSD! I fixed some bad grammar because I was very emotional when I typed this review the first time."

NOW, the nitwit ticket takers have begun announcing that, for everyone's safety, people should be seated!   ""Everyone's safety?""...surely they're referring to the safety of the MBTA's and Keolis's pocketbooks!  Neither could care any less about the well-being of their passengers!  If they did, they'd retire a lot of the grotesque bathroom cars that are both too small for the amount of people riding and also stink from the poorly maintained bathrooms they carry.  I must admit that I actually puked in one those bathrooms in 2003 and I'm pretty sure it's yet to be ""flushed.""  ----- Also while they're at it, they might think about retiring some of the surly, power mad ticket takers!9/11/17: Quick Update III:  YEP, consistent only in the fact that they still suck!

The Keolis run commuter rail service, which costs quite a lot to use, is an unmitigated disaster.  Surly conductors (including one power mad woman on the Rockport/Newburyport lines), 3 seaters that might fit three VERY SMALL children, and delays nearly every morning and/or night make for a dismal commuting experience.  The newer double decker trains have no wi-fi and very cramped quarters while the older cars frequently smell, have many replacement seats filled with what feels like concrete (watch your tailbone), and windows that are so dirty, they look like they're tinted green.   Can you say ""sucks"" on YELP?...because Keolis sucks!"
96,1,"Apr 9, 2014","Maybe this is a US mass transportation problem.  After riding on metro systems from major cities around the world, I was quite shocked in regard of the metro system they got in Boston being a major city in the most developed country of the world.I was skeptical after riding on the blue, orange, and red line, but the horror came after trying the green line.  I felt like I just time traveled back to the early 1900s.  Perhaps they kept it that way for historical reason to demonstrate one of the oldest cities in the US.The most frustration part was faulty fare gates, it popped up a message saying see staff for help, but there was not a single staff personnel in the entire station.  Then we saw a few students just walk right past a gate under maintenance without tickets, and another couple used a 1-for-2 method.  I suppose these were common practice by the locals.It is true the driving experience is terrible, but that is no excuse for a city to keep a poor metro system.  It sucks driving in many major cities around the world too, but they were able to maintain a modernized system.  Perhaps MBTA truly reflect an accurate image of the city?"
97,1,"Nov 9, 2018","Compared to most old European subways, the Mbta it's not only old, it's always delayed, confusing, smells like urine and weed, the green line constantly reroutes and you have to know the secrets to take C or E to park street or Kenmore to catch a d line commute from govt ctr, and dont dare take it midday or after 7p ur waiting for an hour....  and the Charlie card looks like the monthly pass So don't dare get them mixed up... You may be scolded by a trolley driver for trying to skip out on $2.50 when you pay the $85 monthly...

98,4,"Sep 18, 2016","I'm a New Yorker who headed to Beantown to watch a Yankees vs Red Sox game (we lost). I took the Red line from South Station to Park Street and then I took the trolley to Kenmore. Kenmore station is roughly a 10 minute walk to Fenway. The MBTA is one of the cleanest systems that I've ever used. Most of the stations and train cars were spotless. There were a few homeless people (I don't judge other people), but they weren't aggressive like the panhandlers in the NYC subway. The trains have a tendency to bunch up. The wait times can range from 2 to 12 minutes. The trains move pretty fast. It took only 20 minutes to travel from downtown Boston to Fenway. The cars on the Red line were comfortable. The trolley, however, uses an older car model that is somewhat decrepit. Still, it got me from point A to point B.Almost every part of Boston is served by the MBTA. It goes to Fenway, Logan Airport, and two of the best universities in the world. There's even a commuter rail line that travels from South Station to Gillette Stadium. If your car tires are ""deflated"" then you can take the train to the Patriots game instead. The fare is reasonable- a one way ride is $2.75 and an all day pass is $12. The only caveat is that the MBTA shuts down between ~1 AM and 5 AM, so if you're clubbing on a Saturday night or if a Yankees vs Red Sox game goes to the 15th inning then you have to take that into consideration."
99,1,"Apr 13, 2016","Ahh the T! My old, dirty, tired, broken down, transportation buddy! Here are some of the lovely issues with the T:1. Service issues plague the subways- the Blue Line I have never had an issue with, and very few with the Red. Orange line is a nightmare and always breaking, so is the Green Line, but that's because it runs on old trolley lines.2. The commuter rail. I ride this daily. Among the issues are switching problems, Amtrak delays, breakdowns, and cold weather. Those super duper new locomotives hate the cold apparently. Kind of like my Ford. I ride out of North Station on the Haverhill line, which is one of the lines most on time- however, I grew up in West Concord on the Fitchburg line and that line sucks. It's constantly 15 minutes or more late. Go figure.3. Cleanliness... are the trains ever cleaned? I mean more than once a year or once every 10? They're filthy. The blue line is clean cause no one freaking rides it. Orange is super sketch and grimy (and overcrowded), Red is sorta ok, but smells a bit, Green is dirty and overcrowded. The Commuter Rail? Filthy, old, and always dirty. Do they ever wash the exterior of the cars? They look vile, and with a 40+ year old locomotive pulling the train- it's laughable at best.4. Staff. Don't get me started on the pay scale- most are unfriendly and unhelpful. Commuter rail conductors are touch and go, some are better than others- the few engineers I've spoken to are pretty cool. But the customer service department? Don't make me laugh so hard!There are more, but that's the T and people who ride it daily know the issues plaguing the transit system in this city. One stars because well it doesn't allow zero."
100,1,"Jan 31, 2011","I'm all for public transportation, and the Boston T set-up isn't that bad. I commuted to school using the Orange line for two semesters and it's usually very reliable and convenient. When the T is reliable, I don't have many complaints. I do wish there were some sort of connections between the separate Green lines (besides buses), and that it ran later than 12:30am, but that's besides the point. I'm here to talk about the commuter rail.I don't have to use the commuter rail every day (thank God), so it could be more reliable than I've experienced. Maybe I just have bad luck? Or bad karma? I dunno. I like to think of myself as a nice, compassionate person (though I do have a bit of a short temper). But still, I'm not quite sure what I've done to deserve such horrible luck with the commuter rail.Even in the fairest of weather conditions, the arrival time has always been at least 5-10 minutes later than it's scheduled to be, no matter which line I'm traveling on. Not a huge travesty, but still annoying when I have plans that require further transportation. They should really update the schedules so they're more accurate. All that aside, it's my most recent excursion that has driven me to ""create a business"" for the MBTA as a whole.I just returned home from what should have been a simple 1 hour and 10 minute trip from Providence to Boston, but I assure you 'twas not so simple. The 5:10 train made it into South Station at 9:04. And I kid you not. Check the records (if that's even possible?).Apparently something went wrong with the engine, so they spent ~75 minutes troubleshooting at South Attleboro to no avail. They then sent the next train to switch tracks and back up to our broken-down train so they could hitch the two together and tow us to Boston. Why this took another ~55 minutes to complete is beyond me. And why they made us wait outside in 12 degree weather while all this went down is even more baffling.The overall lack of updates, compassion, and hustle from the conductors is what REALLY ticked me off. When I asked for a refund, the guy smirked and told me to go to www.mbta.com ""like everyone else."" I wanted to punch him. I hope us poor passengers of train 822 will be receiving a hefty sum for our troubles, but I doubt it. I also hope that it won't be a credit for MBTA commuter rail tickets. In that case, it will just go to waste, since I will certainly be taking the Jeep (that gets 13 miles to the gallon) from now on. Forever."
101,4,"Aug 26, 2013","Maybe it's because I grew up in So. Cal. where there was no such thing as decent public transportation until recently; maybe it's because I like trains and trams and other vehicles that move a lot of people; maybe it's because I could park and ride the subway for less money and a hell of a lot less stress than driving; but I am now a huge fan of the MBTA.The two days we toured Boston we used the subway to get into the city.  We found parking for $5 per day at the end of the Blue Line.  The trip into downtown Boston takes about 30 minutes.  The cars are clean and it is pretty easy to figure out where you are and when you need to get off.The only confusion we really had was at the Government Center hub trying to figure out the Green Line.  Once we finally figured out which train we needed, it was a piece of cake to get to the Science Museum.The MBTA also appealed to my bargain side.  My wife and I purchased 7 day passes for $18 each.  While we did not need the full 7 days, and we paid $5 a day for parking, we still saved because parking in the city is outrageously expensive.  Also, I saved myself a ton of stress because driving in Boston really is pretty intense.This is a very good public transportation system.  I was happy to see that it appears to have very good ridership.  There was only one really freaky wierdo that I saw during our two days using the MBTA so it seems they keep it policed pretty well.Highly recommended public transportation if you need to get around Boston."

This agent was completely useless other than the fact he insisted upon escalating the situation every chance he got. I HIGHLY recommend retraining. Every time I went to speak he would cut me off to the point that I had to state for him to stop cutting me off when I am speaking. He refused to let me speak to a manager, first stating there were none (extremely surprising to me with numerous years of  working in and managing a call center team), then stated they were busy, then stated they were there but still refused to let me speak with them. He seems unaware of basic processes and proper customer support handling. He informed me that it is not his problem nor the MBTA's issue that I was charged $281 for a monthly pass, and did not receive that pass. Also not their problem to work with my bank who i conferenced in to provide an authorization code to cancel said pending transaction. Stated that they do not have any control over said mTicket app and no one else does. He replied to the bank representative that the only way to get in contact with someone that does in fact have that power was by mail. I find it absolutely mind blowing and quite frankly a lie that you have no power over your app as you are the merchant. The representative's name was Naris. Thanks to him and by extension you I missed a day of work in office. Not to mention he stated to me in a very condescending tone ""I appreciate your determination but there's is absolutely nothing we can do"".

I was able to go as far as Samuel Adams Brewery and far down Back Bay and felt comfortable taking the MBTA. The only time it let me down was when I was further down the Back Bay and waiting for a bus, I was not able to find a bus and ended up having to take a taxi. It is convenient, but does not operate past 12:30am in most stations so that's not convenient if you want to go out to a bar to hang out until late. I would still recommend it as a method of transportation if you are visiting Boston as it is far more convenient than driving or taxi."
109,1,"Aug 8, 2015","YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING.....For a major metropolitan city, Boston's T subway is more nostalgia that efficiency.Haven ridden San Francisco's BART, Paris's RAR, Washington D.C.'s Metro - the T SUBWAY is a JOKE.The ticket machines are hard to understand and negotiate. The home screen shows purchase values of $5, $10 and other. A round trip pass costs $5.30, but in order to pay $5.30, you must select ""other"" and enter the purchase value.Plus you cannot buy more than one pass per transaction. For a family of four, that means four separate transactions and credit card swipes.The cars are old and in disrepair.The system is not intuitive.Once underground, the signage is not clear as to the direction one must go or the next stop.In this day and age of technology and automation, the T Subway is lacking in both.The subways stations are run down and dilapidated.The few that we visited smelled of vomit, urine and homeless people.Walking through town, we walked under some of the elevated tracks. Many have substantial rust and corrosion. It is amazing that they are still standing.Got to love the ""make work"" for union operators... many rear subway cars, that are connected to a lead car - have an operator sitting at the controls. They cannot even see where they are going. They MUST be union workers....I even watched a MBTA worker allowing people to enter via the exit turnstiles.Only redeeming value - the low price reflects it's technology and efficiency.Visited July 2015"

I've seen way too many tourists freak out when their stop comes up or ask you every block if they're there yet.The T got me pretty close to every place I needed to go so I can't really complain, but I will; however, my two complaints are very minor. First, it would be nice if there was a 3-day Charlie ticket - lots of people take weekend trips and it would be nice to have an option besides 1 or 7 day passes. Second, it may be temporary, but the Fenway Park stop is downright confusing. I knew it was too good to be true when I walked up to the platform without passing any fare gates. Apparently I was supposed to know I should hold my ticket up as I boarded or get on by the conductor. The conductor called out anyone she suspected of not paying (including me). The whole method seems very suspect, I didn't pay out of confusion, but the girls next to me who flashed their cards were still called out for not paying. We all ended up having to go to the front of the train to swipe our cards. I pity the fool that hates on the T; it's not perfect, but I've yet to meet a transit system that is."

They are short a conductor (heck, one time we didn't have an engineer!)? It's anyone's guess, but you're guaranteed to not get where you are going on-time. It would be great to say that this past bad winter was the only reason, but the trains run just as inefficiently when it's spring, 70 degrees and clear, blue skies. The train is dirty, the bathrooms are disgusting and many of the seats are torn, caving in or falling apart in general. Try not to touch anything, and definitely don't put your bags on the floor (no matter what they tell you). If you're lucky, you'll get to ride this train line and have an interaction with the infamous Gidget Gaines, aka the train conductor from hell. If she isn't slamming the train door in your face as you are just about to board (""People wait for trains, trains don't wait for people""), then she's either sneering at you as she collects tickets or staring you down with her ominous (and unforgettable) brow. Watch your step, people, she WILL mow you down. And in her famous words, ""Have your monies"" ready when she comes through because, you know, apparently MBTA accepts all forms of currency? Heaven forbid you're not ready, you won't make that mistake with her again. On the flip side, you aren't a true commuter until you've had a run-in with the rude and legendary Gidget. Unless you're her friend - then you get a free ride (or even use of her pass!). The prices just keep going up and the service keeps going down, down, down. Soon it will make more sense to just pay the few extra bucks to take the Amtrak into Boston. To sum it up:1) There is no such thing as on-time on the MBTA. There is DEFINTELY no such thing as an ""express"" train. Don't bother rushing to make that special train that makes less stops - it's a sham.2) It's crowded. Really crowded. You will get coughed on, stepped on, sneezed on, elbowed and will be made to suck it up as the conductors cram people onto the train so that you literally. cannot. move. Talk about fire hazards.3) While a handful of the conductors are nice and friendly, there are a fair share of rude and unfriendly types who will make this unpleasant experience even worse.4) The cost to ride this abomination of public transportation is ludicrous. Absurd. Insane. Staggering. High way robbery."

Commuting on a day to day basis is miserable and 75% of the time there is a problem with a train which delays you long enough to be late for work. It's best to take  it around town when you don't have to be on time for anything and don't want to deal with driving and parking in Boston.

When the world end and alien astronauts explore the universe; and when they smell urine in a particular spot in outer space, that spot would be the former location of the Arlington St. MBTA Green Line Station.I live in Bellingham, Washington now.

Cons:Elevators need serious cleaning and fixing - too many times I had to use the stairs with my kid's stroller, half freaked out he would fall or get pushed down a hundred stairs or worse, that I would fall, taking everyone with me.

133,1,"Aug 9, 2018","I really thought that NJ transit and the MTA were horrible transportation companies but I was sadly mistaken. The mbta takes the cake. Buses are hardly ever on time or come earlier than expected which results in you having to wait for the next late bus. The drivers then take out their incompetence on passengers and make it seem like it's their fault for them being late. Also, machines hardly work for the Charlie cards/tickets. I find it ridiculous how a supposed 30 minute commute gets dragged out into one or two hours due to these drivers and their poor customer service. I can only imagine how much prices have increased over the years and how service just declines. Despicable!"

I have yet to get one that does not give me internet-related issues. I work in transportation, so I know a strong signal CAN be held. The ugly: Prices. The prices keep going higher and higher. The breakdowns and malfunctions happen more and more frequently. Why? I was just delayed due to malfunctions this morning and this half-an-hour delay threw my schedule for a loop. Still took my ticket because hey, my inconvenience is of no issue for you. Again, I understand working in transportation. Mechanical things will falter, but it is clear they don't maintain these trains for the life of them. They always seem so filthy. Hey.

140,3,"Oct 29, 2011","An almost 50-year old system, the MBTA (Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority) controls all the buses, toll highways, commuter rail, subways, and ferries in the area.The design is simple and effective - though I would like to see entrances numbered clearly like they do in China or Taiwan, where you can really see which entry/exit you come in from, and better signage as to what's local and around the area.The Green Line reminds me of the Green Line in Philadelphia's trolley system.Can get very crowded, so be warned during the evening hours.It's cleaner than the NYC subway system, but also newer, so tough to compare.What I do like - they still do the 1-day ticket pass (good for any MBTA transportation all-day). NYC would be wise to reinstate that. $9 for all day rides. $2 a ride otherwise."

This train had been one of the worst experiences of my life and i can't wait to get a new job so I dont have to deal with this ridiculous schedule. they disturb so many peoples lives because they have poor maintence and are under staffed. to top it off, they almost never inform you on why there is a delay until the poor workers are forced to do so themselves. I wish to never ride this train again, and i feel bad for whoever has to."

145,3,"Dec 5, 2007","Being that I live in NYC, I tend to compare the rest of the world's subway systems to our MTA, and Boston's MBTA is no exception.  The subway cars, like the city are tiny and compact.  They remind me of San Francisco rail cars that zip along the city, except underground.  When its rush hour, I can imagine each individual car being tight with people, which was the case and I was using it mainly at night.The system lines themselves are differentiated by colors, no numbers or alphanumeric combinations of any sort.  This in itself made the maps very clear and easy to understand.  Another plus to the individual stations is that they were all mostly well lit and had fans blasting during the hot summer time which is something NYC could most definitely use.  Like the MTA in NYC however, I have seen piles of vomit, piss, and trash in some areas which are putrid in odor and disappointing overall. Thank goodness the downtown part of Boston is small enough to where almost everything is in walking distance.  The city is too beautiful to spend time underground, only to wait for the occasional mini-train to pass by."

149,2,"Oct 1, 2014","Even though the t service covers the majority of Boston and students,  professionals and pretty much everyone without a car relies on it, it's not what it should be. Orange line: always packed during rush hour. So if you aren't right next to the terminal stops, don't expect to get on. If it's not rush hour, budget 15 min of just waiting for the train. After 10.30pm budget 20 min. Shuttle buses to get to Boston are absolutely exhausting. Red line: by far the best and fastest of the t. Usually on time, with a decent frequency. I'd say 3.5/5 for it. Green: horrendous frequency and slower than a biker. But the cleanest of all.Blue: takes you to the airport!  And the beachm 4/5 for that. But it could be safer. Silver: also takes you to the airport!  Decent service.Mbta: Good for getting out of Boston, but the morning schedule could be better to and from Providence on weekends. Prices keep going up and the service isn't getting better."
150,4,"Apr 22, 2014","As a visitor from a far off LALA land, the MBTA blows away anything LA has. I found this system to be much better than the NYC subway and very similar to the San Francisco Bay Area BART system. Its been way to long since I took any other local train system to recall with any certainty how it would compare to that as well.Overall the cars were decently cleaned, I wish they had had more seating though. The seats almost entirely lined the edges leaving standing room in the middle. I think it would have been a bit nicer had there been rows of seats like a bus or regular train. It was set up so that people can bring their bikes with them, except for during ""rush hour."" Pro Tip: This option is much cheaper for folks trying to go into Boston from the burbs and or from the airport if they are staying in Boston proper and don't want to rent a car.Overall the MBTA system is set up nicely and extends all over the major metropolitan area. It was definitely nice to have most of it subterranean in the city itself. The outdoor stations with open air platforms during the winter storms may really suck though. Hopefully I wouldn't have to wait for a train on one of those platforms in the midst of a blizzard. Pro Tip #2: Love that the munchkins can ride for free... Mine definitely enjoyed the ride and I loved that it was free for her.I also liked that the system was set up to easily swap trains and for a very cheap price overall. Using the Charlie card with a preset rate regardless of distance is a bit different but worked fine for me. This certainly made it easier than trying to calculate total costs and putting that much on a card. Generally I did enjoy taking multiple trips on this system and was pleased with its efficiency and frequency. I suggest that you give it a go to, regardless of if you are a local or a tourist."
151,4,"Sep 3, 2013","I have a love hate affair with transit systems like this. Part of me really likes them, part of me realizes how unconvenient that they can be, and part of me thinks that the price (subsideized and otherwise) are not worth it. I think that the parking situation for some of the stops on this route were beyond atrocious... Seriously the Malden station had a pay lot with at most 100 spaces whereas the Wellington Station had what could have been 750 or 1000! The station locations are somewhat sensical, however, if they had really wanted to increase ridership and lessen traffic, wouldnt they have bigger lots and built them to cruise alongside of the freeways?Pro Tip: You purchase a round trip with each use at $2.50 ea direction. This is by far cheaper than parking in Boston itself.Overall though its a pretty good system. It is about a million times cleaner than the NY Subway, its not half as unsightly as the Chicago El, runs with the efficiency of SF Bay Areas BART and it is much more userfriendly than the London Underground. So it is a plus in my opinion. Pro Tip #2: Children under 12 are able to ride for free! Very nice perk!Many of the elevators and escalators seemed to be under repair. I also noticed that they would randomly send cars to a siding or reroute them on the orange green and blue lines for no reason and out of nowhere. I have never understood that kinda thing, but what are ya gonna do other than take and move on?Overall it wasnt a bad thing and helped on my trip there. I would definitely use it again if I was in the area."
152,1,"May 17, 2019","Constant delays that cause you to miss connecting routes/commuter rail. When the weather is bad, the mbta tends to stop functioning even more than usual, leading to an additional half hour to your commute at least. Unfortunately mbta has a monopoly on public transportation in the greater Boston area so there's no other option unless you own a car or want to pay exorbitant rideshare prices everyday."
153,4,"May 8, 2014","Wow, what is with the hate for the MBTA here? I absolutely LOVE the MBTA; in fact, it is my one of my favorite things about Boston! The price for a monthly pass is reasonable ($70), which includes both bus and subway service. Every single thing in Boston is less than a half mile from a MBTA station.  Sometimes the distances between stops are ridiculously small; for example on the B line, there are stops on every intersection. I am from Florida; where the trains come every two hours and they are about ten miles apart.  People who cannot afford cars really suffer because they waste so much of their day on transportation, or they end up housebound. I like having control of my own day with good transport, so I definitely appreciate this service. Here are some tips to make your experience less sucky:--Buy passes at the entrance of the MBTA stations. Some stops don't have machines. In that case, pay cash fare ($2.50) and then buy a pass at another stop, or 7-11. $11 Daily Pass/$18 Weekly/$70 Monthly. --Watch how other people use their ticket first. If you put the ticket in, and you don't go in when the gate opens, your ticket won't work for another 20 minutes!!  Also, if you entered at the wrong entrance (inbound vs. outbound), don't go back outside to the other entrance, or you will get the timeout. Try to see if there's an internal staircase to switch direction.--If not, it might be better to walk then to wait for the timeout to end. Remember Boston is really small. The walking distances between the stops on the Green Line are about 5 minutes, and on the Red and Orange, about 10 minutes. Even stops on two different lines can be very close. Ex. Copley (Green) and Back Bay (Orange) look far on the map, but they are two blocks apart.-You can go between Green Line E Prudential and Orange Line Back Bay stops internally by walking through the mall. --Use apps like Moovit to get real-time info about your train or bus.--The MBTA monthly commuter passes (from Boston to other cities) INCLUDE local service, so do not buy both commuter passes and local passes.--Many employers in Boston offer free MBTA passes to their workers. So if you want to reward me for my awesome review, please consider selling me one =) Also, you can message me with any questions."
156,1,"Sep 30, 2014","Inefficient, ineffective, rude employees and and terrible service.This is especially amazing considering several other city's have discovered how to run their public transportation effectively.Hey Boston, here's a tip: don't converge all your subway lines into one point, that's just stupid!"
157,3,"Mar 20, 2014","I'm a part time writer. I get some of my best material from the MBTA. When I get bored with my characters, stymied with my plot lines and feel that my descriptions are stale and cliched, I can just hop onto the MBTA with my Charlie Card. (Keep in mind that I usually am headed somewhere, but the thought of random rides has occurred to me.) From the man spewing darkly fascinating Kennedy assassination theories out loud to all who care (Caroline and Teddy were responsible) to the blissfully lost tourists with their delightful enthusiasm, I have gathered all kinds of ideas for characterization. I've seen every imaginable form of body waste, every kind of poverty plea and every body type that exists. (Along with some body parts that should not be seen in public.) I've seen rude drivers, sweet drivers, near misses on the B Line, large rats, fare jumpers (very common), way too many drunks, a snake, a bird and six baby mice in a pink plastic cage. I've seen fist fights. With blood. When I am in a hurry, it's late. When I am not in a hurry, it's on time. The Green Line's brake situation must have contributed to the mild hearing loss in my right ear, which my Primary Care Provider informed me of in a raised voice last year. That's the line I use most of the time. The screeching sounds coming from the Green Line can be heard for close to 1/3 of a mile away. This is true. The prices go up, the stations shut down, the escalators get stuck, the stations are dirty, but I really have a strong affection for the MBTA. I'm glad they are staying open later for the college students, I'm glad they are fixing the Government Center Station, and I am very glad they are extending the Green Line. Thanks for all of the good times, MBTA."

159,3,"Jan 29, 2009","Daniel Grabauskas, General Manager of the MBTA...let's go for a homo to homo stroll. But I'll do the talking - you're a gay republican and shouldn't speak.I think it's really cool that you're in charge of the oldest subway system in the country. And I really like some of things you've implemented like the convenient Charlie Card and those announcements of when trains are approaching. *Runs and pushes old ladies to make the train*But there are definitely some things you need to work on. For example, I realize we're running on a one track system so disabled trains will definitely cause delays. But howcome there are also delays when trains aren't broken down? Come stand with me outside on a January morning in Boston and experience what your passengers do. It's rush hour yet the trains may take forever to come. And when they do, there's no room to get on. No worries, we can stand and wait for 3 more trains to come before I freeze to death...no prob right? And what's the deal with those advertisements from overpaid athletes telling me to take the T? You should study marketing because when I'm standing on the platform, I'm obviously already a customer...and we all know that these Pats and Bruins players don't take the T themselves.And last but certainly not least, I have a big problem with the fact the T shuts down at 1AM. Don't you think it would be wise and SAFE to have public transit available until at least 2:30AM on Friday and Saturday? Or would you rather people drive home drunk or hop in a cab that is equivalent to driving with someone intoxicated? Just sayin'Thanks for the chat. I hope you were listening.P.S. - As for the buses...do they really need to have stops on almost every corner? What are peoplez legz broke!? OBESITY EPIDEMIC IN AMURRIKA!"
160,1,"Apr 2, 2008","One million NEGATIVE stars. Seriously unacceptable. Dear MBTA, I often shrug off my mishaps with the T because for the most part it's tolerable.. but what happened yesterday is completely unacceptable. I have a employee credit card for travel. If the person reading this doesn't know what that is.. it's a credit card supplied by my employer that deducts money from my paycheck monthly so that I can use it when purchasing a pass for my Charlie Card. Point is, I get it taken out of my paycheck before taxes which saves money. Yesterday, I tried to use my employee credit card, only to get two screens that said ""Transaction Canceled"". The Boston Globe salesman had to tell me the machine was broken. ""It's been broken all morning."" So, not only did it not work for me, people before me and after me were going to have issues. He pointed to an open gate and said that everyone was just going through there and to try buying a pass at another station. This has been happening for months, so I just shrugged it off. Does the T realize how much it's throwing away on the first of the month when people are strolling through those gates? After work, I went to the Boylston station to buy a pass and was once again denied. I got two screens that said ""Transaction Canceled"".. then another screen after the MBTA person came over and said that the machines were working fine. Obviously, they weren't. Or so I thought. I got on the phone with credit card company and the T employee called his ""superiors"". The CC people told me that my statement shows that I charged the card at 8:39AM that morning and so it was up to the MBTA to rectify the situation. The MBTA worker told me that his superiors told him that it was up to the credit card company to rectify the situation. No one wanted to take responsibility for the money that had somehow vanished. Because I didn't have money, I used my change to try and buy a one way ticket. Unfortunately, your machines only takes 20 coins at a time. You should definitely post that somewhere more bold. Luckily, I found a dollar and was able to make it to my appointment in Kendall Square. All out of money,  I walked home to North Cambridge/Arlington from Kendall Square last night. I'm glad my coat had a hood. Life could be worse. I could be homeless or jobless. But I am pretty poor. And I was wondering who would like to take responsibility for my $60. I cannot afford to buy another pass. You guys charged me and didn't deliver the pass. Isn't that illegal? And if it isn't illegal, isn't that wrong? This will probably get tossed into a bin of 1,000. But I figured I'd write, because I just had to say something. This.. is really unacceptable. ----------I tried to file that under refunds, because I realized how many daytime minutes I wasted talking to the credit card company last night.  What can I say? I'm in between paychecks and poor. The MBTA has yet to respond.UPDATE: 4/4/08 Credit card company returned the money to my account. Still no word from the MBTA through phone or e-mail. I'm kind of glad I didn't have to go to an office to argue. I don't know if I could really fight to have a pass to this underground place where I'm groped, stepped on, pushed, forced to wait, and hit in the stomach with a backpack. I mean shouldn't I get paid?"
161,2,"Oct 13, 2006","I could probably write a book  filled with all my rantings and ravings about the T.  I don't want to seem ungrateful, I'm glad we at least have some semblance of a public transportation system, but, at the same time, I get more and more frustrated every time I step onto a bus. A lot of my complaints arise from two bus lines- the 1 and the Silver Line.   I don't have actual stats, but I wouldn't be surprised to learn that those two lines are the most used in the system.  There are a lot of freakin' people on those damn buses.  And, unfortunately for me, most of them are complete fucking idiots.  Some simple rules everyone should follow to make commuting on the T a better experience: 1. Move your ass to the window seat.  Do NOT make people ask to sit down.  When you sit on the aisle, legs spread out like you own the world, you are effectively taking up two seats.  People that do that should be fined and/or banned from the T.  The only time it is acceptable is when there is some really gross wet spot and/or food leftovers in the window seat.  This is especially unacceptable during rush hour when the bus is packed and your fat fucking ass can't be bothered to move.  You are not entitled to two seats, sorry. 2. Strollers.  They are a safety hazard.   It's not my fault you have a three year old to tote around or that you feel the need to cart it around in a gigantic SUV sized stroller.  They shouldn't be allowed on the bus.  And, I should not be expected to CLIMB OVER THE SEATS because you've blocked the entire aisle and your attempt to ""help"" is by pulling the stroller closer to you, leaving an aisle of, oh, four inches.  Not even Kate Bosworth's skinny ass can get through that. 3. Bus drivers, if your bus is full, don't try to pack more people on.  In addition to wanting to get on a bus, many of your passengers want to get OFF the bus when their stop has finally come.  Climbing over people and being pushed around is never an acceptable predicament on the bus.  (I've actually been late to work because I'll wait for the next bus when I see idiot drivers like this--- and yes, the next bus is completely empty).  And, on top of being crushed in like a sardine, we all end up being late.   4. Hey T- how nice of you to inform me to ""expect delays due to heavy traffic in the downtown area""- but by now you should realize that there is ""heavy traffic in the downtown area"" EVERYDAY between 4:30 and 6:00 p.m. and plan accordingly.  When there are 75 people waiting at the silver line stop at Temple then you've officially fucked up. 5. Teenage girls: why can't you sit with your friends?  Why do you have to take up the entire back 12 seats of the bus when there are six of you?  Other people would like to sit in those seats, but we can't because you'll scream and giggle in our ears.   6. Greenline conductors- open all the doors.  Seriously- making people climb all the way from the back, then letting the stream of people on the bus is a twenty minute process.  Do you really care about the T's profit margin?  No, I didn't think so.  There is absolutely no reason for this safety hazard.  It's dangerous!  One entrance and exit on a train?  It's fucking ludicrous!  And, if I ever hear another fucking conductor get on the PA system and yell ""Move towards the back, there's room in the back""  I might actually go postal.  They can't see if there's room in the back.  There isn't room in the back, you idiot.  We all do a pretty good  job of moving to the back even though we know that your one-door-opening ass is going to make it a pain to get out again. 7.  In general- shut the fuck up- don't yell, scream, talk loudly, or bring a screaming child on the bus.  Noise pollution is highly underrated in this city- a little peace and quiet goes a long way.  It's no wonder people try to drown it out with their own iPod noise (which doesn't bother me, hey, if you want to go deaf at 40 that's your prerogative) 8.  The T needs to ban food.  Seriously.  It's disgusting.  I don't want to smell it, see it, or hear someone eat it.  DC bans it- and their subways are surprisingly clean.  This is especially annoying on the overcrowded Silver Line where your trip isn't going to last that long- you can wait till you arrive at your destination instead of risking getting ketchup on the poor schmuck sitting next to you. Things that don't bother me about the T: I don't need it to run all night or until two in the morning, but I'm old and cranky; the orange and red lines are pretty decent; compared to the rest of the world, the T is still cheap- NY, DC, Paris, London, even Denver- all more expensive;  Okay- end rant."

THE BOSTON MBTA is an outdated and unsafe MONSTROSITY driven by a corrupt state that has it sunk so deep in debt that can't even pay the banks interest.  The Red Line breaks down hourly - and its overcrowded and outdated cars leave commuters freezing on un-sheltered platforms in the winter.  There are never any police to be found underground on the train or platform.. the Transit Police are all out sitting in a cruiser on the street - far away from the violence underground.The tunnels between Alewife and Harvard are collapsing during the rainy season and the whole system is in need of a major change due to the fact that modern cars cannot be placed on the old tracks which are too small.  The state and federal government does nothing about it.Try riding the so called ""Silver Line"" through the Ted Williams tunnel and tell me if you don't have back pain from the experience.  It takes a two hours to fly from the Carolinas to Boston.  It takes three hours to get home from the Airport waiting for the dreaded T."

Today's commute is another poor example of the subpar service Keolis/MBTA provides on the Worcester/Framingham line. We were trapped on a train that came to a complete stop at Wellesley Hills, due to mechanical trouble. One conductor provided the option to jump on a train heading back to Worcester. Why would I want to go back to a stop I just left?Twenty minutes later we were told that only 55 people had the option to get on a bus that was coming to shuttle passengers to Back Bay and South Station. What about the other passengers that did not make the cattle call to get on the shuttle bus?  Someone could argue that we were kidnapped by Keolis/MBTA today, as we were being held against our will on a train with no lights or central air. Today is another example of what always begs the question: What warrants the next fare increase? Guess what, it was announced that we can expect another one very soon. Conductors do not announce stops, trains are dirty, windows are fogged making it difficult to see outside windows and today we were trapped on a train. When does the torture end? When will a better company save us from such poor service? Keolis, you have failed."

I called it the Boston Masticare - a bad pun off the Italian transitive verb ""to chew.""  Our journey begins with the Boston public transit (""MBTA""), which is a combination of trollies and underground subways.  Of the the 5 subway lines, the Green Line is the most confusing with letters that split off at certain points.  You think you're on the right train that's heading in the right direction, but you later realize that you end up going off the wrong path.  Given time, you learn to adapt.  The fixed fare ($1.70 CharlieCard, $2.00 Cash) is nice so you never worry about being short changed.  The trains are clean but I can't say the same about the train stations.  When compared to DC's Metro system, I still prefer the more familiar DC Metro.  Call it hometown bias.  Call it simplicity.  But then again, the worst public transit is always the one that you're waiting for.[Original Visit: Feb. 14, 2009, 10:33 AM]"
174,2,"Jan 8, 2007","It's not that its over-priced, its under-subsidized!  Boston could and should have a world class metro but we have a craptastic metro instead. It looks, feels and smells like a dump, its over-crowded on the redline and an inordinate number of the transit cops come across to me as the most bored-out-of-thier-minds, poorly trained unprofessional bunch of LEOs this side of New Orleans.The drivers for both the bus and the T are the saving grace...sure you get your occasional surly lipped bastid...but most of the time they are decent people with a sense of humor which surprises me when I see some of the crap they put up with!  I love my T, but that's why I expect more from it, cuz I know what it can and should be!!"

What crap!The MBTA is nice, but I've only had an outstanding experience a few times; His name is ""Richie"", and he likes the 60 route. The guy always says hi, smiles, and makes your day by just being in a damn good mood.Until the MBTA runs until at least 1:30am, I'm not upping the stars."
176,1,"Feb 14, 2013","One of the worst public transportation systems ever. Rude, incompetent staff (possibly racist--bus drivers have refused to pick me up). They keep on increasing the price while reducing service. Also, why does the system shut down at 1 am??? how do you expect people to get to the airport for an early morning flight? Horrible, horrible! For a city that claims to be cosmopolitan and efficient the mbta is a real shame.Also, just the other day, a 1 bus driver and a homeless man fought for nearly twenty minutes on Mass Ave. He refused to get off (because it's cold and snowing outside) and so she refused to drive. Eventually the police came and dragged the man away. I know this happens in a lot of cities, but Boston treats its customers like cattle--the dehumanizing experience and the stupidity of the whole system is a real nightmare."
177,1,"Jul 21, 2008","Literally, an international joke. We've all heard the stories of how things are run and we've all experienced the incompetence and hostility firsthand. The MBTA is barely competent, corrupt and idiotic. They're also on the verge of bankruptcy and things are only getting worse. A friend of mine who worked here told me firsthand that all anyone (including him) did was push pencils around, ignore the work to be done and drink on the MBTA's dollar. He confirmed that the stories about deceased people being on the payroll are absolutely true. I know running mass transit is an enormously difficult, surgical task. So I sympathize with them, to a point. And it is a functional system - I get to work every day, not always on time. Not all of the problems the system has are because of mismanagement. But most of them are!"

179,1,"Mar 23, 2013","Oh how I hate you MBTA. What a shitty transit system you are. Perhaps the worst I've had the displeasure of experiencing. I've tried Chicago, DC, NYC and you fall furthest from acceptable public service. Where to start? Almost every week there's some delay on the Red Line. I've come to accept that just because I have to be at work in the morning at a certain time doesn't mean we're on the same schedule, I've adjusted for it. There's also those stupid turnstiles which half the time don't work or register my card incorrectly. And when they do work properly there's always 1 or 2 slackers that runs up behind me to forgo paying their fare. Actually there was one time when your turn style at Park Street was broken and I went right on through, since I had a monthly pass anyways. I was stopped by an undercover cop for that. At least I think she was a cop . She was dressed in plain clothes but flashed me her gun and not her badge. I assume she was a cop since she didn't rob me after asking to see my Charlie Card. That was scary but it wasn't my fault your crappy turn styles break often.Was that the last time this train system saw any improvements or an upgrade? I'm sure you've noticed the ever increasing load of passengers during rush hours. Whatever happened to adding that other line? I mean clearly that Green line expansion is a long time coming. Is it going the way of another Big Dig project to never see completion?In the mean time perhaps trying to fix the current tracks you've already got in place? I swear that the green line alone counts for a good deal of hearing loss. From North Station to Hynes you would think that the high pitched screeching sounds are not the best on the ears.

182,4,"Jun 11, 2012","Wow! After reading the reviews of the folks who are actually in Boston, I'm confused but I will rate this totally based on being a tourist and it being user-friendly.I have been on many subways in cities I visit in the US and in Europe and I have to say that the MBTA in Boston was easy to maneuver through to get to all of the places I needed to go. Christopher M. mentioned nothing good about it and Kris A only had a good point of it actually existing. Tough crowd! Maybe you have to live in Boston to know whether or not it is something that is good for the town, but being a tourist in Boston, I would not have survived without it. It was easy to use and covered all the spots I needed it to from the airport, downtown, South Boston, Harvard, and all the way to Quincy.It wasn't the cleanest ever but in comparison to other subways I have been on, it was above average. I'd definitely use it again and recommend that other tourists use it to save a ton of money. Cabbing it can take most of your spending money. I'd rather use it on new designer shoes."

Basic public transportation.I frequent the Blue Line and the Commuter Rail system from Lynn-North Station.  Very rarely do I have any issues with the T.People will complain a lot, but few people realize that the MBTA is one of the cheapest public transportation systems in the United States.  It is far more expensive in Los Angeles, Washington DC, New York.  There are some issues that the MBTA needs to address.  In a city the size of Boston with a large metro area......they need to find a way to run past midnight on the weekends.  Many people that go into Boston to the bars, drive in because they know they'll be stranded if they stay past the 11 o'clock train at North Station or the midnight subway train.  In an effort to curb drunk driving and present better service the MBTA union should find an acceptable middle ground for 24-hour service.  Without a full-time public transportation system, Boston will always be a step behind other major cities in the world that are more available to visitors and residents of the area."

The driver looks directly at me as he drives by. I take this train nightly from work so I know it's another 25 minutes until the next train and it's raining slightly. Being that I work in a gym: I run past the train and get on at Packard's Corner.The driver says to me I wasn't on the platform, so just get on the train and stop complaining. I asked how he knew I wasn't on the platform if he knew where I ran from? He then refused to give me his driver I.D. number. This is absolutely ridiculous, and this crap happens almost daily.2)This morning the train is 20 minutes late, and when we get to Packard's Corner it apparently is going express: but the driver DOES NOT make an announcement. The other passengers are left to ""telephone line"" it to the back of the train. The driver then starts getting pissy and I confront him asking how he thought this was the riders' fault and not one of the MBTA? Then he closes the door on my face.3)I have COUNTLESS memories of: doors closing on my face while I'm on the platform, trains going express w/o announcements, trains/ busses being severely late. I remember for instance the last snowstorm we had. I was on the 57 coming around the Union Square corner in Allston. The bus has maybe 5 people on it, in a very heavy snowstorm. The bus did not stop from St. Elizabeth's Until Harvard Ave @ Brighton. I saw ~20 people in total standing outside including elderly, people with strollers, students with backpacks. This is not an isolated case.I've voiced several complaints and have never received much at all aside from ""there are delays.""5 stars? Who paid that reviewer? Ask any one in Boston about a review for the MBTA. I would gladly bump it up to 2 stars if the MBTA hadn't simultaneously cut services while hiking the fare.MBTA= Mostly Bad Transportation Assistance*p.s. this was posted on another MBTA page...I do not understand why there are so many MBTA pages...*"
188,2,"May 28, 2007","I bitch a lot about the New York subway, but after spending some time in Boston I realize we actually have it pretty easy in the Big Apple. First, the price of the Boston subway is outrageous. It recently jumped from $1.25, which was reasonable, to $2, which is a total ripoff. For your information, a subway ride in NYC is also $2, but there are over 20 subway lines and you get two rides for free when you buy 10. In Boston where there are about 5 lines $2 seems hardly justified.Second, the subway doesn't run at night... this may seem like a small point, but it pretty much means you have to pay for a cab ride if you want to stay out after 12am... ridiculous and incredibly annoying.Third, it really isn't very reliable. I have been stuck between stations for 30 minutes before, and I am not exaggerating. ""We are momentarily being held by traffic ahead of us""... this works for a few minutes, but after half an hour without any serious explanation or even an estimate of how long we're being delayed I start getting the urge to smash people's heads with a baseball bat, and I am the most laid-back and cool-headed guy you'll ever meet. Seriously, it would be faster to walk! What saves it is the relative cleanliness of the stations, although the trains at the end of the day are so littered you have to watch your step... Is it really too difficult to pick up your trash when you go?"
189,3,"Jun 23, 2006","Complain all you want, the T is better public transportation than is available to most people in the United States.  It needs improvement -- maintenance is long deferred, communication suffers from a clear lack of guiding leadership philosophy on the subject (namely that it's important), and the system suffers from design flaws owing to the unavoidable realities of its history.  But let's not go around whining too much.  Go try living in the suburbs without a car sometime and tell me how bad dealing with the T is by comparison. The T's biggest problems stem from how the state funds it.  Right now the T carries the highest debt load of any transit agency in the country, a result of fiscal restructuring imposed upon it in 2000 by the legislature.  It cannot expand any more, it cannot run later hours, it cannot avoid fare increases, and it ultimately cannot continue to operate if this condition doesn't change. So it's in your hands.  If you think the T sucks, well, it's because you're not going to your legislator to tell him/her to end the debt burden and allow the T breathing room.  You have to remember, a lousy T means politicians always have a cause to champion for you -- they're never going to change anything unless you pressure them to.  I know, I know, first they want you to vote, and now you have to actually do something.  Being an adult in a democracy's a bitch, ain't it?    Bottom line = The T is pretty good, should be much better, and is going to get much worse soon unless you do something about it."
190,2,"Nov 23, 2012","Dear MBTA, Like many other reviewers have already stated, the MBTA is clean, affordable, has the ever so famous Charlie Card, and runs to many major stops within the city and its suburbs...good job. You've been awarded two stars.But what makes this transportation system stuck in the stone age is the huge annoyance of the trains shutting down at midnight, especially on weekends before bars close. I haven't read up on why this is still in effect (as I'm sure it has been hotly debated), but it seems absolutely nonsensical to everyone who lives outside of Boston. Bars close at 2; subways close at midnight. It isn't rocket science. Not having the commuter rail at night means more drunk driving. Most of us do not feel like paying the creepy chain-smoking cabbies $100 to drive us home, especially when there's a commuter rail stop within our town. And we wonder why there are so many accidents on i93...So do us all a favor MBTA and my beloved city, and end the frustrating arguments between my friends and I about who will be the DD, if it's worth it to drive into Boston, if we should go to that crappy townie bar or not, and if men have the ability to develop breast milk.

191,1,"Feb 6, 2019","I wish I could give ZERO stars. The MBTA is a disgrace to the state of Massachusetts. I have been logging complaints about ONE bus driver since September 2018, who blatantly disrespects us CUSTOMERS, by showing up late to the bus stop (after the posted departure time on every posted schedule possible) and then parks the bus to take a 10-15 minute bathroom break. My son who relies on this said bus, is Tardy to school EVERY single day, but whoooooooooo cares, right? You want these children to be positive, active, SUCCESSFUL members of the community, yet you show them that people can waste their time and function on their own accord, without any regard to others? If my son skips school because his bus has him waiting in the cold, he's a bad kid, right? Never mind that he shows up EARLY to be responsible and HE is the child. The MBTA operates because WE pay for it! That bus driver has a job, because of US... but he gets to not do his job properly and still receive a paycheck? But mine should be compromised because you have poor disciplinary policies and I am showing up to work late? My son gets punished for showing up to school late, but a grown man gets to walk around like he is invincible? Oh, but the solution is WE should find another route? Why should we be inconvenienced instead of your company DOING IT'S JOB! I will forever not recommend ANY single human being to takethe MBTA, or offer support.

Then, when we contacted MBTA Revenue office again, They gave no apology for any inconvenience. By any human error and machine error, it took over a month and 5 charlie cards and 4 mail postage and  my time. It is so not worth all the inconvenience.AS FOR SERVICES, they never mob the floors on the trains, or sanitize the handles and seats. I often see them as union workers as they never work with passion at any station.The shabby tracks are another matter. I think wrong people are running the business and this is a typical sign of poor controls. New overseeing government is necessary to change these.

If you live in Boston, you shouldn't take the T like a tourist.As to scheduling on the buses, there are apps for your iPhone or Droid called ""NextBus"" which is a geo-location app notifying you about the arrival of the next transport with up to the minute data.  Also, the Silver Line has been pretty reliable, and I sometimes take the Number 9 bus to Southie and no problems.I should add as a caveat that I am not a daily user.  Probably 15x a month.  I could see how frustrations would grow.  But remember, do not compare the T to private transport.  It is public, and as such, you do have to be with the public.  There's nothing the T can do about  Boston's public...unfortunately."
198,2,"Mar 12, 2012","My two star rating has nothing to do with the proposed service cuts or fare hikes. If you look at other transit systems across the country, they are looking at the same problems.My rating is based on the services, or lack of them, especially, the train service, here in Central MA.First, there is no service available to the western part of the state and the service east towards Boston is nothing to be proud of.Having grown up essentially in the central part of Long Island, I am used to much better, 24 hour service, something the MBTA will probably never deliver."
199,4,"Jan 7, 2016","First of all, people need to realize that the MBTA was the First Subway in America! Thats right folks. Therefore a lot of the infrastructure today is still based off of the old trolley lines (green line). Each line really deserves its own rating as they all have their quirks and downsides.Green Line: ""The first and the worst."" The part from Park Street to Boylston was the first subway in the entire country!  The trains come very often but its always crowded and very slow. In fact it is now the most crowded Light Rail system in the entire world! The stations are confusing and the trains stop like every 50 feet to wait for a signal to change.I love taking visitors on it is and watching their confusion as it makes awful screeching noises as it winds around very tight turns underground! :)Red Line: ""The Powerhouse of the MBTA"". This line is the mitochondria of the MBTA. Its fairly clean and efficient and comes pretty often. Yes, there are occasional signal problems but its more reliable than the other lines. This is because it is one of the ""newer"" lines built by the mbta (still pretty old though) and was designed as a subway system to begin with, not a trolley system.Orange Line: ""The great depression--a ride-along journey"". This line is pretty sketch. In fact the most sketchy of all the lines. Trains are very very old and do not come very often (every 15 minutes). Trains are crowded, stations smell terrible. I am a guy and would also not want to travel on this line at night alone. Also there's the fact that there were like 3 fires on it one year that makes me hesitant to take it :)Blue Line: ""Who even takes this?"" Its empty, clean and efficient. The tunnel on the harbor to the airport was dug by hand back in the 1900's or something. Its impressive.  Also the airport station is not at the airport--you must take a bus to the airport."
200,3,"Aug 27, 2008","You guys are so spoiled. Come to Philly and take SEPTA, then you'll know what bad public transit really is. My dad always complains that the MBTA, ""is so dirty and slow and there are homeless people all over the place, blah blah blah..."" In Philly, he had to take the orange line to my graduation and I swear to god it practically TRAUMATIZED him. He still talks about the horrible experience and asks if it has improved at all and if  we still use tokens (no and yes).You could eat off the floor of a Boston trolley compared to what we have here. Still, I give the MBTA three stars because I remember what it was like to leave work and cram into a hot D line trolley filled with smelly Sox fans who totally could have gotten off at Kenmore but don't feel like walking the extra couple blocks because they're too fat and lazy and oh my god their kids are so annoying, ect. Also, what's with the new trolleys that have like a mile of empty space in the middle with nothing to hold on to? I really hope they have gotten rid of those. There is room for improvement, no doubt, but this is not the worst of the worst."
201,1,"Mar 20, 2016","MBTA is an absolute shame, the commuter rail from Worcester/Boston is absolutely filthy. I use the train daily and every single seat is sagging. Some conductors are nice other are ok and others just seem like they are up for a fight. The people who make announcement sound straight out of the ghetto. I mean cmon people like cant you even make a decent announcement about taking the cell phones out?Wifi is terrible, trains are slow, saggy seats, almost 11$ a ticket one way, poor staff and customer service, trains have issues every other day, from being late to electric, to engine power issues. I have waited on few stops almost good 20 min. cuz the engine gave up.I think it is time to for some competition to come up because MBTA is totally ripping off american people!"
202,5,"Nov 14, 2011","We bought the 7 day pass on our trip to Boston. A one way costs $2, 1 day is $9, and 7 days is $15. We figured that the best value would be to buy the 7 day pass even though we were only going to use the train for 2 days. You can buy the train passes at all the subway stops. Let me tell you.... it was the best decision ever! Boston is small and everything is close. When I say close, I mean, within 2-3 stops from each other. If you've taken the Chicago CTA or the transit system in NY, Boston's train system is a walk in the park! Signs were posted and we didn't get lost at all. If we come back to Boston in the future, we will be taking the train everywhere. The only downside is that they stop running at 12:30am. Other than that, I think it's the best way to get around Boston on a budget. It's quick and cheap. Can't beat it."
203,3,"Feb 26, 2019","While I very much appreciate public transit, and that we have the T, twice this past month the driver of the 59 bus drove right by me as I waved like an frantic idiot to get him to pick me up at the bus stop. Bus drivers need to pay attention to potential riders as they pass a stop (especially in subzero temperatures) and MBTA could install some lighting at their stops to make passengers easier to see when it is dark. Several others have told me this happened to them as well."
204,4,"Nov 13, 2009","During my stay in Boston, I split my time walking, taking the T and cabbing it. I walked whenever I could which caused me to be tired and try the T. And when that wasn't running, I cabbed it. Of the three options, I liked the T best.It was cheap.It was fast.It was entertaining. Walking to a stop always felt like an adventure. Would the machine today be finicky? Take debit but not credit card? Take credit card but not debit? How about cash? Oh, not this machine. It was a death match between me and the machines. Sometimes they were wily but I was more clever. No debit card? Fine. Let's try the credit card. Oh ho! You don't want to take that either? I got cash! I've outsmarted you, you awful machine!Other than that, the system was pretty self-explanatory. The rides are $2 a ride. If you got on the wrong one (i.e. inbound instead of outbound), you could always ask someone where the next next stop was so you can switch over. I took mostly the red line which I found smooth. The green was slower and curved a lot. I felt imminent sickness coming about. But once I took the orange all the way out to go visit the Sam Adams Brewery. Lastly, we took the silver line to the airport. Apparently this was a bus instead of the subway. Okiedoke.All rides were uneventful except during rush hour. The conductor was yelling at people the whole time not to lean on the doors and not to hold them. I would think people wouldn't want to fall out or lose limbs. Hm.I think next time I'd buy a week long pass though. I managed to spend about $22 for the T for just a few short days. Then again, it is cheaper than cabbing it."
207,2,"Jan 16, 2011","I was ready to look past the late trains, the buses that don't show up, the all around general dirtiness of the subway.  I mean...you can't have it all, right?  But come on...when your trains stop running at least have the sense to tell the riders what is going on instead of dropping them off in sub-zero temperatures for over 30 minutes with no idea what is happening.  This is how riots are started!Their Charlie Card auto renewal is a mess.  I signed up for it and after three months of having the money withdrawn from my account, but being told ""Not enough value"" whenever I tried to swipe my card, I gave up on that idea.  My tip to you is just renew with the machines at the stations.Also...when I first moved to Boston, I actually believed the T driver when he said that a train was directly behind this one.  Yeah, after waiting 20 minutes for the next train I never fell for that one again!  Ugh there's so much more that I can say, but I'll end with telling the MBTA that it is possible to run 24-hour train/bus service.  Stopping by 1am?!  Get real.  Do they have some sort of deal with the cab companies in Boston?"
208,1,"May 12, 2012",review for the websiteIf I could give it a 0 right now I would!The commuter rail schedule is extremely misleading.  When you go on the schedule website for Saturday and Sunday from Middleboro it still has the times.  My 69 year old mother was waiting for the 8:22 train (along with 8 other people who obviously did not know there was no train service on the weekends). Even when you go on that site it says NO SERVICE UPDATES AT THIS TIME.  I beg to differ this is a website to show the schedule and clearly there is a schedule change!  Unless you click on the Middleboro hyperlink and THEN click on another link for advisories you would not know there was suspended service.  I am irate at how misleading this website is!!  How hard is it to take the times off the schedule since they obviously mean nothing!!!!
209,2,"Feb 13, 2015","Poor customer service expediting phone calls. No one answering the phone.Forgot about people looking for simple validation with questions not answeredby looking at schedules that are incomplete  information. i.e. how long ittakes to get from that destination to another?  Bad computer software that shouldallow you to estimate arrival by putting in starting and ending destinations. Director needs to retire after that rant about storms. All she had to say we are doing ourbest with the unusual and nasty weather patterns, period.   People understand, and if you are stuck, you're stuck. period.  We cannot control the weather folks. She answers questions that can't be answered and then does not make sure theones who CAN answer are not there to respond. (customer service, more jobs) duh sounds dysfunctional."
210,2,"Sep 4, 2007","I loathe public transportation but I can't live without it.  I have witnessed the growing pains of The T for years from the age of 5, crawling under the turnstile since my fare was free, to this past weekend where I had the pleasure of riding for an hour from the orange line to Harvard square for the grossly-inflated fare of $1.70.  I don't think much has changed nor has service improved but prices have certainly risen.  I yearn for those years in the not-too-distant past that it was $0.85 per ride.I think that all the lines with the exception of the above-ground green line trains are fairly dependable (you miss one then you know it's abut a 15 minute wait).  Last train is a little after midnight so it's not an option if you plan on a late night.The system is fairly straightforward for it's easy to navigate as a visitor or a new transplant.  I would avoid hopping on the T as much as possible - for many locales, it's faster to walk than take the T. My biggest criticism besides the standard uncleanliness and undependability (where you're stuck on a stalled car for what feels like an eternity) that you would expect from any public transportation system no matter how great it is, is that the hours and frequency of the trains is subpar.  Unfortunately, it's a chicken or the egg situation.  The volume of ridership won't increase without such improvements and without increased ridership,  the MBTA lacks the funds to increase train capacity and frequency.  Whenever I return to Boston, I find myself pondering whether I should drive in or take the T.  Then I think back to those times I was stuck on Comm Ave on winter nights, icicles forming on my eyelashes waiting for an inbound train that wouldn't show up for 25 minutes.  Or those times I was stuck in unventilated Park Street station unable to get on a train because they were all full....each and every one, one after the next.  Or those times in high school after finishing up extra-curricular activities and waiting for the bus in the evening, only for the bus to drive right past me and my friends as if we weren't all congregated under the bus stop sign and waving our hands feverishly for it to stop.  9 times out of 10 I just drive because it just isn't worth the risk of getting screwed by the MBTA."
211,3,"Apr 8, 2006","At the time of writing I live closest to Kenmore station. Heading downtown I can catch a B, C or D line FAST and during commute hours, I usually don't have to wait more than 2 minutes to hop on a subway car. There is a caveat to the increased number of trains running durring rush hour, though, and that is that the cars stop often inbetween stations - I guess their tunnels get ""rush hour traffic"" too, so more trains but long ride times from destination to destination. There needs to be a way to stay on a subway car and go from the Back Bay area across to Cambridge without switching to a bus. It takes me an HOUR to get from Kenmore to Alewife during rush hour, and I can easily ride my bike 5 miles almost as the crow flies in less time. Going all the way downtown to the Park Street stop to get on the Red Line outbound to Cambridge is really obnoxious. It's like travelling in the shape of a horseshoe to get from Back Bay to west Cambridge. Probably a crossing subway at the Mass Ave bridge could work. It's cheaper than having a car but at times it's simply less of a hassle to ride a bike somewhere instead of taking the subway.. Some of the stations are clean and gorgeous. Others are dirty beyond belief. Ruggles? Roxbury Crossing? Blue line? Kenmore...yuck. Spend enough time in Park Street and you'll end up smelling like exhaust. Gross."
212,4,"Jan 28, 2008","it seems some folks here in Boston don't appreciate or especially enjoy the MBTA.  Well, try living in a giant city that completely lacks public transportation of any substance.  That means constant driving, financial overhead of car care, caring about gas price fluctuation, flat tires, and bum nights when you draw short straw and end up the designated driver. . . again.  Public transportation means that you and all your friends get to drink every time.  No one ever has to be sober and ruin the night with their sober-talk.MBTA: gettin' Brosef, Mr. Brojangles, and the rest of Broston drunk since 1897."
213,1,"Dec 21, 2007","I'm a BIG fan of public transportation, I love it and I think it is necessary for communities. I depend upon it. However, the T is TERRIBLE and has only gotten worse over the decades. It used to be 85 cents for the longest time, can you believe that!?? In a time when Toronto and NYC were $2.50 a ride, our tokens were under a buck. But now, with the Charlie Card, THE CHARLIE CARD, it's draconian and insane. The T is blatantly fucking over tourists. WHY are there 2 different tickets and prices for the T? And why is it so mysterious to obtain a rechargeable card versus the ticket? Why aren't the prices listed on the ticket machine and broken into fares or rides?? Why aren't there transfers?? I accidently went the wrong way from downtown xing and realized it at chinatown and had to buy another ticket just to get to the other platform. Not right!It's not frequent, you wait for ever. The schedule messages aren't even right, don't trust them. Stops running long before the bars close (drunk driving anyone??) and the cars are usually filthy.I wish I could give them negative stars."
214,1,"Jan 29, 2015",During rush hours... trains are over crowded and late. 5-10 mins wait for train causes too many people waiting at the platform thus causing too much crowd and have to fight to get in the train.  MBTA sucks big time. they need to upgrade and have more frequent trains(every 2-3 mins) to avoid crowd. Green Line is the biggest joke... you can probably walk and get to places fast enough than riding Green Line.
215,1,"Jan 25, 2008","MBTA: You fail. Miserably.Sadly, there isn't enough room for me to outline the full litany of my complaints about the T. Due in part to the near-constant state of disrepair, the countless delays, the notorious ""switching problems"" and general unexplained unreliability, this ridiculous operation has, on MULTIPLE occasions, reduced me to tears, cost me large sums of money, made me late for work, and actually caused PHYSICAL HARM to my BODY requiring physical therapy - and I'm still not totally okay. They're appallingly incompetent, and if ANY other company had such disregard and utter CONTEMPT for their customers, they would be kaput in no time. Rather than ranting, I'll offer a SMALL SAMPLE of the MBTA Failures & Incompetence Log I maintained on my iPhone spanning only THREE WEEKS.11/27/07 Clear, dark, 43THREE or more runs of 70/70A were skipped. Bus (70) arrived @ 6:38pm. Waited about 50 minutes. Called MBTA.11/28/07 Clear, dark, 30Bus scheduled to arrive @ 5:58 didn't appear. Last inbound bus seen @ approximately 5:30pm. 70A arrived @ 6:09pm. Waited exactly 16 minutes. Did not call MBTA. CentralSquare schedule for 47 bus lists departure @ 6:40pm, contradicting MBTA.com which lists the time as 6:35pm. Posted schedule alludes to alternate weekday scheduling from late September through June. Bus 'compromised' by departing @ 6:37pm. 11/29/07 9:20AM 40OBSERVED 70A arrival @ 311 Arsenal. TWO 70A buses arrived simultaneously. 11/29/07 11:51AM 42OBSERVED 70A stopping about 100+ feet before bus stop. Riders exited. Bus continued down Arsenal Street, failing to stop for rider waiting at designated bus stop. Rider unsuccessfully attempted to gain driver's attention by flailing arms wildly & shouting while chasing bus. Rider was forced to return to bus stop to wait for next bus. 11/29/07 5:50PM clear, dark, 40 70 bus arrived before scheduled time stated on mbta.com - 5:58pm 11/29/07 6:08pm 40OBSERVED 70 bus traveling in opposite direction -2nd since my arrival at bus stop just before 6pm. Still no sign of next due inbound bus. 11/29/07 6:14pm 39 70A arrived. Driver was friendly and welcoming. CONCLUSION: The 70 bus arrived a full 8 minutes early, while the 70A was late by that exact amount. This bloated the wait time between buses to 300% its usual length - stretched the wait from 8 minutes to 24 minutes! 12/18/07 6:20 - 6:54 pm  28 Waited @ Harvard Station for the 77. When I arrived, about 25 people were already waiting. As our wait time increased, the waiting crowd grew. Called MBTA & was given an excuse of ""holiday traffic congestion"". This is ABSURD considering the 77 runs straight up & down Mass Ave, & I already had seen the surface roads in much more highly-congested areas such as Memorial Drive & Harvard Square, where no abnormal traffic was observed. MBTA representative hung up on me. When 77 finally arrived (after at LEAST 35 minutes), two were sent at once to accommodate more than 100 waiting passengers. Still, both buses were standing-room-only. 12/19/07  9:48am 31 Arlington Center, inbound, Mass Ave@Jason St. Stood directly atop snowbank (as no path was cleared in waist-high snowpiles to allow access from sidewalk to road). Was CLEARLY visible standing closer than one foot to the bus stop sign, however, 79 bus failed to stop to allow me to board. Hence, I continued FREEZING for the next 16 minutes while waiting for another bus to arrive. 12/19/07 6:25-6:52pm 33 Have now been waiting for the 77 bus for 27 minutes @ Harvard Station. Schedule lists the 77 route as leaving Harvard Station every 10 minutes or less at this time of day."
216,3,"Nov 12, 2006","I probably would have given the T 4 stars if it wasn't using that stupid Charlie Ticket system!!!! What's wrong with tokens? They're simple, easy to use, easy to understand, they don't get ripped, it doesn't matter if they get wet or if you spill coffee on them. They take forever to use!!!!I miss the good old days, when people got on, dumped their change/tokens in the box and sat down."
219,2,"Feb 10, 2012","Not that great. Leaves a lot of Boston/Cambridge/Brookline uncovered, and the buses are not very reliable. It sucks having to walk twelve minutes to the station, take a line for ten minutes, wait five minutes for a transfer, get on another line for twelve minutes, then have to walk another eleven minutes to get where you're going, when you could just drive to your destination in ten to fifteen minutes. The T has nothing on the NYC MTA.OH YEAH, IT STOPS RUNNING AT 12AM!! EVEN ON FRIDAY/SATURDAY NIGHTS! WHAT THE SHIT IS THAT?!?"
220,3,"Mar 25, 2012","The MBTA has good public transportation, considering the size of the metropolitan area. It's user-friendly, compared to say, Santa Fe Trails (that has limited hours&didn't have a ticket kiosk back in the '90s) or the Napa Valley Vine (that looks messy, but it does its job) The MBTA is excellent if one doesn't have a car. One can go to various museums (the Institute of Contemporary Art is way off the beaten path), take it across the Charles River to Cambridge, see the sights of Super 88, the Boston University Campus, Beacon Hill, the Mother Church of Christian Science.Public transportation tends to be superior on the East Coast than on the West Coast (or the Southwest) The conductors are friendly, one gets helpful announcements, there are maps, the train cars are clean. Riding the T, one can see how Boston is the Athens of the West because they are oft filled with students taking notes&reading their textbooks. The MBTA goes above&beyond."
221,3,"Feb 21, 2009",Every major city has their transportation issues-coming from NYC the T of Boston has the quaint appeal of an airport tram. The whole inbound/outbound thing gets me confused-15 years ago it cost 85 cents and now it is on par with the $2 of the NYC subway.The map and route and figuring out where you are going is pretty straightforward.
222,1,"Aug 29, 2017","Most of the time, MBTA buses are careful and conscientious.  Not today.  Bus 70, 7:15 pm going west on Western Ave cut in front of the car in front of me.  Then at a stoplight, I go in to the right lane and he cuts me off.  At the next stop light, he stops near the curb and makes it impossible for a bicyclist to go past him.  Total jackass.  Should NOT be on the road."
223,2,"May 16, 2012","The MBTA is the ultimate ""love hate relationship."" Sometimes I walk down the stairs of South Station to find a Red Line waiting for me. More often though I'm stuck out in the rain waiting 45 minutes for a 57 bus to take me home after a Red Sox game. Step up your game MBTA and maybe we can bring our relationship back to a good place."
224,3,"Oct 23, 2007","Ahh, the T... I've spent so much time on the Green Line trying to get into Boston from Riverside...The trains are decently clean and comfortable for public transportation, but they take FOREVER and there aren't nearly enough of them.  Plus, why does everything close down at 1am??  Why can't we stay and party in Boston until 3 in the morning?!I demand a better system with faster trains that run all night - more fitting of a major international city!"

226,2,"Feb 12, 2007","Psst... Do you think the MBTA knows of our despisal towards them?  Then how come it's just not getting through their damn heads to do some improvements!?!!  Everyday I see the workers just hanging around and doing nothing, except talking to their buddies.  Now that we got the automatic card/ticket, why do we need these people?  It's not like they're there to sell tokens.  You'd think they're there to aid anyone who's having trouble buying tickets or are there for security reasons, but I don't think so.  OK, they do help people, but they yell at them!  I've witnessed a few of those things too many times.  I don't want people to be jobless, but why don't you just get rid of these people and stop hiking up the fares from the money you saved?  Or at least people should do their jobs.And why do you need to employ (PAY) guys to individually hand out the Charlie Tickets?  A monkey can hand out the tickets and it'll be more entertaining.  Can't you put it in a box and put up a big sign and commuters will pick them up?"
227,2,"Jun 29, 2008","You suck.But I can't live without you. Things I hate about the T:  You close way to early in this city. Maybe you're just a victim of the greedy politicians of yesteryear and the cab drivers associations, but really at least stay open an hour past the bars close to help out on drunk driving deaths.  80 years ago the modern AC was invented... apparently you had no idea.  Stop breaking down already. WTF!?!  Why are you constintly raising your prices every 9 months like clockwork??  Stop rolling empty trains past me AFTER EVERY GOD DAMN RED SOX GAME!!! You're going to get someone killed if you keep that shit up.Props for the recent face lifts at some of the stations!!  And the Charlie Card really is waaaay more better than tokens.

228,3,"Jan 25, 2008","Everyone bitches about every public transportation service in the world.  Honestly, I swear.  I lived in London where the Tube was expensive, but unbelieveably efficient and easy to get around.  Yet people still made up hate songs about the Underground (which were actually pretty amusing, but I digress).I must admit, there are moments when I have to bite my lip to stop from screaming at T drivers (or just the general disembodied entity of the MBTA), but I get around ok most of the time and don't need a car, so....I can't bite the hand that feeds me.  Well, not TOO hard."
231,2,"Apr 8, 2018","My fiancé takes the train everyday and most of the time it does great but you would think on Boston game nights (Bruins, Celtics or Red Sox) they would have trains more frequently....nope. Prepare for normal to longer travel times, even on weekends."

233,2,"Nov 16, 2017","The heat is always blasting, whether it's freezing outside or 80 degrees in the summer. On the Providence Line outbound, conductors don't announce the stops. Some conductors are rude while others value their jobs and are worth every cent they're paid. Sadly, good conductors are few and far between. There's a blonde lady who's a real sweetheart and she's usually taking tickets on the 5:50pm train. Sure the prices are astronomical, but she has a great personality so forking over my hard earned money is slightly less painful when she's in the cart. The wifi is advertised but it barely ever works. Train was an hour late last month because it was raining the night before. If Boston parking wasn't so expensive, I'd probably just drive to work every day. The Canton Junction station is not protected very well from the elements, so it's always important to wait as long as possible to walk from the parking lot to the station's track maze 11/12 of the year. Some of the train carts are new-ish but others are in their 30s like me, the seats are ripped and very saggy. I'm not fat but I feel claustrophobic in these seats. Between parking and train fare it's about $4 cheaper per day using the train as opposed to driving into the city. I've noticed the outbound trains are late more frequently than the inbound ones -- but they're all too late in general. Whether it's 10 minutes or 60, it's not good. People's jobs are dependent on them showing up on time, or at least the scheduled hour of when companies open. The MBTA is the #1 reason I'll never get rid of my vehicle. Why do the prices keep rising?! Neither service nor quality have risen in decades- and they're always cutting stops or widening the time between trains."
234,4,"May 6, 2014","Overall, MBTA does a darn good job keeping Boston moving.  I've been to many other subway cities, but Boston really does well in terms of weather, operations, time, cleanliness and combined service (bus-rail).  Easy to ride to/from the AIrport, and after moving here, I sold both of my Subaru's and bought a Charlie card....I haven't looked back."
235,2,"Mar 26, 2009","Ugh. After four years in Boston, including a summer and a semester of taking the Green Line 6 miles downtown and back each day (putting me at nearly two hours of T-riding a day), I can conclude that the T is something I will miss the least.  Having grown up in Washington with the speedy and clean Metro, nothing can really compare.  Still, the T doesn't even come close.  Boston College has the unfortunate position of not only being at end of the Green Line, but situated at the end of the B branch of the Green Line, the bane of the MBTA existence.  Anyone who lives along the B Line route knows exactly what I'm talking about, but for those of you who don't, suffice it to say that the B line literally stops every 25 feet, and is subject to the same traffic lights etc. as other cars, culminating in an hour and fifteen minute commute if you're like me and have to take it the entire way.   The first thing freshman at BC learn is to take advantage of the fact that the C & D lines are a short shuttle ride away on the BC Bus and will get you there so much faster.  Of course, this doesn't even take into account the fact that the T could do one of any number of things once you are already on it:- Break down.- Break down again.- Restart, break down a third time, and require an emergency rescue from another T as you watch the minutes tick by and frantically type an email to your boss about how it looks like you might be late to work, again.- Decide en route to become ""express"" to a certain location, and skip all other stops along that route.  Don't worry though, there is a train immediately behind you making all ""local"" stops.  (What is this, the commuter rail?).  ** Side note: this is actually awesome if you are A) already on the T and B) not among the group of people whose stop was skipped.- This, again, is specific to the Green Line, but don't forget the bottleneck effect at Kenmore where are the lines merge into the underground system.So why two stars and not one?  It looks like the T has been trying to make a comeback in recent years, with new stations in some places and the CharlieCard system.  Though the T has a long way to go to reach the efficiency of DC's Metro, I give it props for trying. And after all, what else is there?"
236,2,"Jun 18, 2013","Transportation? To me it seems that cattle have sometimes better transportation than this so called ""T"". I think how I dont have to mention anyone who experienced the green line how bad it is. Yes, it is the oldest subway in the US, but it seems that MBTA thinks that we all are visiting a museum, not traveling somewhere. I walk faster than the green line on the major part of its routes. MBTA is a picture of apathetic Bostonians who would not complain to their local government even if they make them pay 100 % more for the ticket and offer less number of trains.  The blue line sometimes is decent and the red line as well. By the most part, I noticed how they have less number of trains on duty than they had before, while charging more for travel and not offering a service that would go at least until 2 am when most of the bars and clubs are opened and many people finish their work shifts."
237,1,"Jul 18, 2013","How is this not more modern? We have some of the best colleges around here, and this is the most archaic system. The underground sections during the summer are an inferno and the fans are freaking useless.  It also doesn't make sense that the T officially closes around midnight. For some reason they are still running after midnight, yet I can't ride on them- I know this because I can hear them and every time they pass by and they interfere with my crappy wireless internet."
238,3,"Jun 11, 2006","I love public transportation. just let that marinate for a second.  i have ferocious road rage so i generally try to avoid driving at all.  generally i rely on my legs to get me around (it's a wonder the places they can take you!) but some places are beyond my scope of reasonable walk time, so i rely on the MBTA to get me everywhere else. No, it's not a perfect system, but the fares are reasonable (though rising!) and with enough planning you can get anywhere you want in the greater boston metro area. Granted i've not witnessed any tales of horror that one hears of, and if nothing else it's a great place to catch a nap en route!"
239,4,"Apr 22, 2010","I love subways. I love nice big color-coded subway line maps that spiderweb across a city. I like the automated turnstiles...the roaring rush of a train pulling into a station. For as much as I adore subways, you'd think that I'd live in a city that actually has one. But I do not. Thus, I very much appreciate the ""subway experience"" when I travel elsewhere, and the ""T"" of Boston's MBTA is at the top of the list. The cars are pretty clean, the trains run frequently, and you can easily get pretty much anywhere in the city. It would be nice if they ran all night to accommodate late night revelry, but I suspect MBTA is intentionally avoiding the shenanigans that erupt when bars close their doors. A nice bonus is that many of the T stations have Dunkin Donuts located inside, which seems like a perfect combination for morning commuters.I spent much more time on subways than on buses while in Boston these past few days, and my couple of bus experiences weren't quite as superb as those of the T. The drivers seemed a little abrupt and one was visibly exasperated when I asked whether I ought to run my pass through the fare machine. I took the 71/73 out to Cambridge and back and I can definitely say that the bus wasn't running every 12 minutes on the return trip as expected. No problem for me as I wasn't in a rush, and I can't say whether the delay is indicative of the bus system in general."
240,1,"Mar 13, 2016","Bus #2290 on router 9 from Copley Square, driver refused to give her number. Needed to add money to card, so let everyone else go first. Fare box was not working correctly and was not registering button being pushed. Took an extra 5 seconds trying to get machine to work and driver gets impatient. She was 20 minutes behind schedule with another #9 behind her. Starts name calling, yelling, insults me for being slow and is generally aggressive for no reason. When I call her out for being rude,""that's so rude"", she becomes angry and kicks me off the bus. Won't even let me get her driver ID, had to grab bus number instead. Very unprofessional behaviour. Also yelled at another passenger for not letting an elderly further down in line on the bus first. Very belligerent and should be fired."
243,1,"Jun 19, 2017","The MBTA is dirty and smelly. The transit police have nothing better to do than issue parking tickets for slightly expired inspection stickers. But god forbid they actually do anything to fare skippers, people littering and smoking, pan handlers, etc. Thanks for absolutely nothing and please keep up all the great work you don't do."
244,3,"Aug 16, 2010","8:00 am Friday after a quick passby of the original CHEERS at Beacon Hill which I walked from the Hertz at Park Plaza, I was pretty much ready for some local flavour public transportation.  The closest subway station was Arlington from a local and she referred to the transit as the ""T"".  BTW, most of my comparison is with Toronto Transit Commission(TTC) of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.When I went down I noticed a service booth with a staff ready to assist when needed, however I also noticed throughout the day that they are not always there so do not depend on them as a reliable source if you're NEW to MBTA.  There are 3-4 Ticketing Machines that are very easy to use and accept most payments.  I had no problem getting my 1-Day Pass($9.00) CharlieTicket but the only negative was that I got $11.00 in one dollar coins which I was warned about from the friendly staff at this Arlington station.  I looked for a green arrow lighted up as I slipped my pass in the slot and it came out on top and the display gave me the go-ahead.  I stepped in front of the plastic transparent barrier and 1 SECOND after, it magically opened up.Be aware that Inbound train means heading towards the CITY while Outbound means to the suburbs.  I waited for the train in a somewhat worn down subway setting which still is better than TTC, however like TTC every station has a different appearance.  Even the trains were different from one line to another, some being modern while another being classical.Much like TTC there are announcements as to the next STOP however when its done in this method it can be missed by the patrons.  On the Orange Line I waited there forever waiting for the next train and sweated up a storm as a few of us struggled for prime position in front of 1 of 2 large fans."
245,1,"Feb 2, 2010","Unreal.Buses that pull away even though you made eye contact with the driver as you race towards the bus.Overpriced parking at all stops.Subway stations that smell of pee.

246,3,"Oct 6, 2011","Great way to travel but with some major character flaws.  Some of the buses are still old and rickety, giving off lots of smoke and heat even in summer.  You need a step ladder to climb onto them, same with some of the Green Line trains.  One car on the Green Line is usually an old one which are much harder to climb into and out of for the mobility impaired.  You never know if it's going to be the first or last car so you stand in the middle of the platfrom somewhere.  There's a scramble for the new car's door when it arrives.  Drivers are sometimes really surly too and revel in slamming doors in the face of passengers rushing to enter the doors.  They scream through the loud speaker alerting passengers to their intent to close the doors right on them as they are trying to enter.  I was once dragged a few feet by an Orange Line train that slammed its doors on my cane and proceeded to drive away despite horrified screams from onlookers.  I was finally jostled free but the driver didn't stop until she had near cleared the station.  Had I still been stuck I would be Yelping to you through a medium.  A rep for the T took my name and info, no one ever called.  Total apathy and loathing for passengers by some factions at the T.  A rabid bum stood on the Park Street platform screaming obscenities at another passenger that had gotten on the Red Line train to Cambridge.  The train sat there idling with the doors open for quite some time, allowing this guy to exorcise his rage filled tirade uninterrupted and threaten the frightened passenger inside while the driver watched from a safe distance.  At the very least they should have closed the door instead of leaving the passenger on board open to be attacked at any time without interference from police or personnel.  People ask me why I wear a coat in summertime.  It's because of the AC that runs on some of the trains and buses on the T.  The air blow gustily and strong down your head and shoulders, especially on the new buses.  The temperature control is minimal from what I understand from the drivers.  It will be 56 degrees out in October and the AC is still on in the bus.  When the T works it's wonderful.  It's better than looking for parking in the city.  If the weather is lousy out leave the car at home.  The T is the best way to go.  Don't be fooled though.  The drunks on the T are that way for a reason.  ;)"

248,4,"Jul 18, 2007","I live in Indianapolis now, home to one of the worst public transportation services in the world. The T could have gorillas for drivers and part of it could be underwater and it would still be better than the ""IndyGo"" crap we have here.I loved not having to drive in Masshole traffic. I hated waiting for the train, especially the Green line at Fenway. I loved the crackly announcements by that overly-perky woman (""Lllllladies and gentlemen...""). I hated the grouchy booth cashiers. One of them threw my money at me (I paid in nickels that day - I was broke, dammit) and told me to come back when I could pay ""real money."" But come on - it was always entertaining. My morning commute to Braintree was always made interesting by the guy with the beard who threatened to eat his Terry Goodkind novel if we didn't give him some ""speah change."" I moved from Boston right as they were implementing the new card system and phasing out the tokens. I see they've raised the price, too. It was still $1.25 when I lived there. Oh, the mornings of scrounging around for change so I didn't have to walk to work in the rain.I never understood why it doesn't run 24 hours, but it didn't affect me too much (except when I had early flights - trying to make it from Back Bay to Logan was a little hairy)."

250,2,"May 4, 2009","Basically, the transportation system sucks. I understand its old, but we live here now, and honestly, stop making excuses.  Here are my reasons:1. The announcements at the stations.  They are way too loud, See something, say something. Well, I say shut the F*up. Seriously.2.  The B line. 3.  The lack of schedules at bus stations. 4.   Service stops at midnight.5.  The annoying Hispanic ""singer"",( Id say noise maker at Park St), 7 am on a Saturday, he is there.  Cha-cha and rumba at  7 am is not really my thing. 6.

252,1,"Aug 7, 2018","Just ridiculous! It's the oldest city in the USA and the oldest public transportation system. How is it possible to have just poor service for such expensive prices? And the killer part is that there's a yearly increase for us! The employees are so miserable, I can't understand it. They get paid substantially more than most and are just the absolutely obnoxious. Plus, when you ask for directions they literally NEVER know where they're going! And to be completely honest, it's not just that they're miserable people, they tend to antagonize some riders. Common sense lacks in most of the interactions I've seen and personally encountered. It's too bad that this is what the people of Boston are subjected to when using a service they need so desperately. Maybe that's the reason the operators take advantage and mistreat the riders."
255,2,"Mar 29, 2006","In some circumstances, the T is okay. I especially like the Red Line. Going from Park Street to Harvard or Davis Square is a snap. Traveling undergound on the Green Line through Back Bay is not terrible, but I'd usually just prefer to walk. Going outbound on the Green Line though, especially on the B Line, is just evil. Anyone who is moving to Boston: do not live on the B Line. You will suffer. Why there needs to be a stop every 50 feet is beyond my comprehension. For example the BU East stop and the BU Central stop are not even a full block away from each other. The Pleasant Street and Babcock Street stops are also ridiculously close to one another. And to say nothing of the T during Sox games. Stay away! Just walk, I guarantee it's faster. I agree with the other person who mentioned there needs to be a way to get from Back Bay to Harvard without going inbound to DTC. Also, it would be nice if there was an actual subway connecting Back Bay and the South End. In order to get from Copley to the South End you basically either have to walk or take go in to Boylston and then take that evil Silver Line bus. At least there's a free transfer. I am putting myself in a foul mood writing this review. I am going to stop now. Bottom Line: usually easier and faster to walk."

I can't even count how many times the train has been ""taken out of service"" for some vague reason....The Red Line broke down more times than I can count just THIS YEAR.... The 66 bus takes an hour to arrive.... the drivers are generally rude.. Last week, one of the Red Line T drivers started yelling at someone over the loud speaker ""How dare you hold the doors open! You endangered the lives of everyone on this train!"" I can't even explain how often I have been late for important meetings and/or events, because of the T malfunctioning... it's insane. The ONLY positive about the T is that it takes you a long distance.. it's a very comprehensive transportation system.

Come on people, if it's not the smell, the sights (all those...people, god!), or the lack of reliability, safety, and almost ANYTHING else you can think of, then it's the RUDENESS of the VASTLY overpaid staff.

260,1,"Mar 28, 2006","Easily the worst mass transit system I've ever encountered. The green line is a freaking joke, especially the B branch. Subway trains are not supposed to stop at red lights and wait for cars: that's what buses do. These trains are constantly breaking down, and when they aren't broken you think they're broken because they start and stop, start and stop, making you want to puke. They have stupidly short operating hours and not nearly enough stops. You're pretty much screwed if you're in, say, Union Square. How could it get any worse? update: JUST HORRIBLE.

It's actually pretty clean here and the setup for purchasing Charlie cards is the best that I've seen (Chicago right now only accepts cash for our CTA cards unless you set it up online)."
262,3,"Aug 26, 2011","To be fair I want to state I am born and raised in Atlanta, GA so I rarely use public transportation.I have used the MBTA several times over the last 2 years when I come up to visit.  I have noticed that the timing of the trains vary greatly.  I am not sure how anyone up there gets anywhere on time!I really hate how crowded the trains get between 4 - 6 pm. It is obviously they need to run more trains at these times.I vowed yesterday to never ever ever ever take the MBTA to the airport again.  It took me 1 hour and 45 minutes to get from Alewife to the airport because of the timing of the red line and silver line.I know that a lot of my complaints are probably based off being a person who mainly does daily traveling by car because of where I live.  The trains are mostly trash free.  The seats could use a shampoo or too, but I know they won't get it.  The variety of smells (from the subways, trains, and people) can be sad and scary."

264,5,"Apr 19, 2007","I hardly ever take the T. I generally walk or bike around the city and I drive to work. But, the MBTA really came through for me today, thus the 5 star rating!  I got a flat tire late last night and had to get to work today in Watertown. So, after a quick 15 minute walk to Franklin & Federal and a quick 15 minute express bus ride on the 504 (where I was the one and only passenger on the bus so he was able to skip the Newton Corner loop) and a 3 minute walk from there, I was at work in 33 minutes! That isn't much longer than it takes me to drive on most days. And the best part was the driver! He was the nicest bus driver I have ever had, hands down. Friendly, happy, helpful...all of that. And when I thanked him for my pleasant bus ride and he told me ""I made his day"".Sure, it did cost $3.50 for a one-way bus ride which would be kind of steep, if you had to do it everyday. But, I did find a free paper on the bus to keep me entertained, which was a bonus.Yeah, I know the T has it's crappy moments with delays and annoying passengers and grumpy drivers etc. But today, the T was perfect. Hopefully my ride home will be just as enjoyable. Who knows, maybe my driver and I were both in good moods today because the rain has stopped and the sun is finally out!"

I went from the Airport, which was a little challenging with the buses to the subway then hopped on the subway to downtown then off the Alewife Station and found my friend's car in the large but run down parking structure.

Just these three things put it way ahead of the SF MUNI and London Tube (though I prefer the Paris Metro).A few things could be improved however:- it would be nice to be able to go from Back Bay to Cambridge without going via downtown. A line running along Mass Ave would be perfect- the token system is archaic and cumbersome. The airport stop has a nice new ticket system - when is this going to be rolled out?- when something does break down, the backup system is not very good. Last weekend, when the blue line broke, there were replacement busses from Maverick on, but it was total chaos, with no-one knowing where to go or which bus to board. It would also be nice if they let you know that there was a problem right at the entrance to the station, rather than letting you board a train before telling you. That way, people could catch a cab instead if they were in a hurry."
271,1,"Feb 2, 2015","After the fires, delays and cancellations in the last week; the rating drops.  Not just because of the service,  but the horrible attitudes of the staff and public relations."
272,2,"Jan 12, 2015","I give them 1.5 because its not yet at the level of a third world country.    Subway service is expensive and unreliable.   The best way one friend put it was  ""The t can get you around Boston in 15 minutes or an hour but you never now which.""  The people working the system clearly are burnt out and hate humanity.   The few times you ask for help with a Charlie card they tell you to just 'hop in behind someone else' rather than get off their seat.Bus service has been surprising in that there is some semblance of a schedule.   However it is a horrible experience with disgusting buses and people insisting on taking up whole sections of the bus.  The cost of keeping a vague schedule is that mbta drivers blow through red lights regardless of who might be in the crosswalk.And the commuter rail.  Late almost daily, but they dont count it if its not more than 10 minutes..then they subtract 5 minutes from the actual delay.   It's significantly late at least once a week.   The dirty cars are packed during the high hours to the point of having people stand.  To add insult to injury,  the employees of this arm of service have some of the worst attitudes.   The culture varies by line but the one I take regularly (Fitchburg express) is bad.   Conductors that are the worst about violating quiet car rules, won't ask some kid to move his bag so an older woman can sit down, they even move slow opening the doors at a station stop.  Only time they show a little life is when someone complains about an issue or collection of tickets.  When someone complains they are quick to either shed blame or just tell the customer they are wrong.   When it's time to collect tix they hustle through so they can hang out together at the end of the train together away from riders.   The fun part of all this is that this line had a great conductor...so much so he was almost a character out of some black and white movie...professional,  nice, high energy,  knew customers names.... but the union forced him out of his position. Oh and bit costs thousands of dollars a year for many to ride the commuter rail There are mbta employees out there that are nice and hardworking people...but from our perspective,  they're outnumbered. Oh and any mbta construction or renovation project costs riders and taxpayers insane amounts of money and 10 times the time any one could reasonably expect."
273,1,"Jan 25, 2008","This organization is truly a joke.  It is full of hacks who got their jobs because they know someone who works for the state.  When I talk about hacks, I mean the management of the MBTA.  There are a handful of surly drivers, but for the most part, there are a lot of good drivers and conductors.  The T gets only one star because it is incredibly unreliable.  I thank God that I no longer need to depend on the T to get me to work.  Some days it would take 20 minutes to get to work, while on others it could be an hour and a half.  Another problem with the T is that they cannot complete any projects on time or on budget.  Just look at Kenmore station.  It was supposed to be done years ago and it still is far from finished.  What does the T do since they spend so much money on wasteful projects?  The raise fares of course, which drives away commuters.I strongly support public transit, but not when the agency doesn't put commuters first.  Nothing used to piss me off more than when the T's spokespeople would ridicule commuters in the old Starts and Stops column in the Globe.  One more thing, restore the Arborway!"
274,3,"Nov 1, 2010","Okay.  So, I used the T again this October.  It wasn't as awesome as on my first trip, but I suppose it wasn't hideous, either.We stayed out of town (in Braintree) due to the fact that we couldn't get a deal on a hotel in Boston proper.  We found a motel across from a T station and were thrilled.  We only found out when we showed up in Boston that, whoops, the Red Line was being worked on that weekend.  Crap.  So we had to use a shuttle bus for part of the trip.So why didn't I rate the T lower?  Frankly, the employees.  Maybe it's because I'm from the NYC area, but I found every single employee of the T to be friendly and helpful.  Despite the track work, everything seemed to run quite smoothly.  The trip took longer, but there was no confusion.So, not bad, overall."
275,4,"Jul 10, 2010","Up front: I'm only reviewing the subway, and as a tourist.First, a...question, I guess: I'm not sure how crazy passengers equal a problem with the system itself. I mean, it's *public* transportation, and some members of the public are plain f--king nuts (PFN).Now.  I happened to luuuuurrve my 4 day T experience.  Nearly all the stops are wheelchair-accessible - one can even board without having to find a conductor to find a portable ramp (or pray and do a wheelie).  That alone would've sold me.  But wait!  There's more!  The lovely, color-coded, easy-reader maps are awesome, of course.  The trains themselves seemed clean and seemed to run fairly often.  We didn't encounter any crabby employees (to the contrary - everyone was quite helpful).I understand that delays/breakdowns/drunks can make anyone PFN, but I wonder if they show up any more often than on any other subway line in any other major northeast city (the snow factor).  I'm looking forward to using the T again."

Oh well, guess I'll just be sucking it up for the winter then back to walking as soon as the weather gets better :-)"
277,1,"Feb 18, 2015","The MBTA was bad before the weather turned ugly but it's even worse now! Long commute, three hours for a trip that should take 50 minutes. Trains and trolleys not running. Tracks not being cleared of snow. Bus stops with huge piles of snow that the MBTA doesn't clear. Our wonderful Governor (NOT) sits around talking about what's not his job in a state of emergency but if he had to get out of that SUV of his and take the T, it would be fixed immediately!  Horrible delays and now they say 30 days to fix it! Thirty days and when it's ""back to running"" the service will probably be as horrible as it was before!"
278,2,"Sep 7, 2014","BLEGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH. The MBTA is the bane of my existence. I'm literally counting down the days until I no longer have to rely on this god-awful service. In fairness, It's mostly the Green Line and the buses (OHHHHHHHHH, the buses) that cause the majority of the headaches. The Orange, Red, and Blue lines are usually OK. USUALLY. But not always. But the Green Line and the stupid buses are the WORST. UGH UGH UGH. I cannot express my contempt for having to rely on both of those terrible parts of the MBTA every single day. The amount of times my commute has been extended by 20, 30, 40, 50, and yes even 60 WHOLE MINUTES, simply because a scheduled bus never showed, or was dreadfully late, or there were ""power problems on the orange line"" or it took 25 minutes to wait for a Lechmere train to finally come to North Station. It goes on and on. Unless your commute is just Red Line only, or Orange Line only, you are likely going to experience some sort of problems. And how is there no crosstown subway??? The only way to get from cambridge/allston areas to the JP/southern areas is to take the 66 (pfffffffft) or the 1 bus (pffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffft) There really ought to be another subway line that addresses these problems. I've seen a few really nice theoretical subway maps that DO address them. I'd beg for their implementation, but since nothing would get done until long after I've stopped using the MBTA, I don't really care. Also, can we talk about how drug deals and usage go down every day at the BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER 1 bus stop? Seriously??? That needs to be addressed. So does pretty much everything else about the 1 bus, but I digress. And the fact that I sent 2-3 emails asking why scheduled 88 buses just never showed and I was stuck waiting 40 minutes in the frigid cold Boston winter waiting for another one to finally arrive? Never answered. Again, I'm am counting down the days until I no longer need to rely on this awfulness."
281,1,"Jan 11, 2018","If I could give zero stars I would. I'm a nurse in Boston and take the commuter rail on days when I can't drive in and literally almost EVERY time I take the train it is delayed or cancelled, yet they raise prices every year and promise better service. If you can avoid it, don't ever take the train. Not worth it. You'll end up calling into work late almost every day. Not only that, but the MBTA does a terrible job of notifying you that there is a delay while you are at the station. You have to just keep refreshing the app to wait for an explanation of why the train is so late. I often find myself taking a train that is several hours earlier than I need to be taking just because I know there will be a delay. Worst service ever."
282,1,"Mar 15, 2018","Took it today, and of course get late to work. At 12:30 pm they simply don't open the doors at chestnut hill station, so train took me to the next stop. When I left the train and cross the trucks in order to wait train back, next train don't came until 1pm - making me wait 17 minuets, the fallowing train run 1 minuet after it. I have no explanation why during no rush hours gap between train 17 minuets.."

I am writing a review today because I have never gotten such horrible service before. This was on the green line, when for some reason the green line was disabled, so everyone had to wait outside in the rain for the shuttle busses. I waited for the first one... packed. Second one...not packed, but got kicked out because the bus driver changed his mind last minute about sticking to the rules about the ""entire body has to be behind the line"" thing. Third time... 5 minutes passed and no shuttle, so instead I walked 3 stations to change to the red line..."
285,4,"May 21, 2015","I can see how this system would drive commuters crazy but if you're just a visiting tourist this is an experience you mustn't miss! For instance, we all got on one trolley-train labeled ""Heath Street"", then they turfed us off to go over to another trolley-train labeled ""Riverside"" and announced verbally (loud voice!) that the Riverside was now a Heath Street line. This was missed by one passenger who was visibly annoyed once the trolley-train got above ground and she found she wasn't on the Riverside line.  However, if you aren't in a hurry, big ole clanking trolley cars screech their way slowly out of the hub station (Park Street) via tunnels dug over a century ago and then make it out to above ground stops on the roads. But they will take you (sortof) to wherever you want to go, or near enough, with a Charlie card that you can use on bus or trolley etc. It's allegedly wheelchair accessible -- and I did see hand-crank lifts to get wheelchairs into the trolley cars -- but little signage or other written assistance and if there were elevators, they are tucked away so this is going on my ""Not wheelchair accessible"" list."
286,1,"May 15, 2014",Why is the MBTA commuter rail late 90% of the time?  It is late more in good weather than bad weather. It is completely unreliable and yet prices go up every year? Where is the accountability to customers?!
287,5,"May 21, 2015","I forgot my wallet and in it were my pass,  card and cash. I told the mbta conductor before boarding the train that I forgot to get my wallet with the pass and if I could board the train, he allowed me to. I was impressed by his really understanding nature.."

I rarely drive as I live on the red line, a two block walk from my house and work off of the red line. Which is great for me but must be difficult for others farther from the sparsely located stations. After 15 years living in NYC riding the subway I miss it!"
290,5,"Jun 4, 2012","Just returned from Boston.  While there, my friend introduced me to the MBTA.  Wow!  What a great public transportation system.  My husband and I travelled to Boston from Abington every day.  It was great!  Didn't have to deal with the crazy streets, traffic and expensive parking in Boston.  One can transfer conveniently throughout the underground network railway system. The stations are clean, and we never felt unsafe in our travels.

294,3,"Apr 29, 2008","It's broke. Both meanings of the word.  It has no money. It doesn't function properly. And the two are related.Totally agreed that it's BS it doesn't function past bar-time. But the MBTA has come out and said it COSTS them more to run the T that late than profit they bring in. Like the T needs to be more in debt than it already is? (How many billions are they in debt already?)It's falling behind, and it breaks my heart to see this system failing so badly when I know it could do better. It's a vicious cycle -- it can't afford decent upkeep, people get mad, they stop using the T, there's less revenue. I don't know how the MBTA is going to turn itself around, but something needs to happen. As other posters mentioned, people complain about public transit in every city -- almost no one loves their public transit. It's a city's punching bag.  I'm pretty forgiving when it comes to the MBTA but, that said, most of the gripes about poor service and deteriorating facilities are totally valid.  The worst thing is that this really is the real face of Boston. Whenever I visit a city I make it a point to check out their public transit -- the state of that transit, to me, speaks volumes about the health of that city and its populace. Public transport -- the T -- is for ""real"" people, not for tourists. So how does it reflect on us as a city that this is how we treat the residents?  I don't feel comfortable with the impression that the T gives our visitors about how we think of ourselves."
295,1,"Apr 5, 2007","I've seen somone pee on the bus.  And that should, you would think, be the grossest thing I've seen on the MBTA in 9 years of living in Boston.  But it's not.  Because I've also seen someone poop on the bus."
296,3,"Sep 22, 2011","First off, I come from an area with a pretty much D-rated public transportation system. So I, Julie D. am not savvy to the ways of the train system. So, when hopping the train at Copley Station, I wasn't smart enough to pick the one going the right direction. While I am looking at how to cross the tracks to get to the ""other"" side, someone is kind enough to point out to me that I have to go back to the street, cross it, go around the corner and pick that station. Stupid tourist! And, crap, I have already paid my $$. So, I use a nearby phone to call up the help line. They tell me to simply hold up my ticket up big and proud and slip though the gates with another passenger. Well, don't you know a very loud alarm goes off and people stop and stare. But that's okay, because I am holding my ticket up. Gawd, help me. Next issue, the train comes. It is packed with a ton of people. People behind me are pushing to get on, so I go with them. We are like sardines. Did I mention we are going to the Sox's game? Yes, that explains the gazillion peeps on the train. So, someone at the front of our car manages to get stuck in the front door, so it won't close. Then, a message appears on the board saying ""this train is out of service"". Yay. Then there is the announcement on the speaker system, ""this train is out of service"". Double yay. So, people start to shout ""hey, open the door, we need to get off"". Well, the door doesn't open and even if it did, I'm not getting off. This goes on for quite some time. People are getting mean and shouting ""open that door"". Crazy town. I don't think I would want to be in a life or death situation with some of these people. So, finally the door at the very back of the train opens and people start pushing their way out. And about 30 seconds later and door closes. And we are on our way. Gawd. So, the trip was pretty much uneventful after that. And so was our trip back.  The trains and stations seemed pretty clean, however I never got a look at the seats.  I love public transportation.  I wish I had some!"

I called the MBTA help line and they were NOT helpful with providing information about purchasing a card in the Waltham area.    I was told the only way I could get a card is at a subway station.  I don't ride the subway and have no reason to go there!!  I was told that was the only place I could purchase a card.   The online information did identify one store called the Village Market.        My first bus ride, the driver was angry at me because I was going to pay in cash for my trip.   Bus line 70A.....He let me on for free.

(see above)-Service ends at 12:45...  'nuff said-I haven't heard it yet but I'll add it to my list - that the MBTA has the audacity to think that most people would want to listen to T-radio.

Kidding.It was a Friday night, a little after 1AM, and a co-worker and I exited the train and passed through one of those old fashioned turn-styles -- you know the kind, the revolving door with black, germ infested bars jutting out like evil teeth...An MBTA drone locked it behind us, which we thought nothing of, and got on the escalator to head towards freedom, fresh air, and, most importantly, last call and a bathroom.  I had to pee like nobody's business.I mean, I really had to pee.I cannot stress this enough.We got to the top of the escalator, walked straight, turned the corner and lo and behold, the grating was down over the exit/entrance to the station.Trapped.We ran down the upward bound escalator, got to the bottom, and started yelling for the MBTA employee who locked the revolving door.  No response.  No luck.  Gone.  That mofo made a suspiciously quick exit.Two phone calls and 35 minutes later, an MBTA car pulls up and two henchmen get out.  Both were disgruntled, androgynous looking things who were completely cold and unapologetic.  I swear one of them had a giant, circular key chain and used a skeleton key on the padlock for the grating.I jokingly tried to convince them to drive us home.  ""No.""  When that didn't work I tried to convince them to hail us a taxi.  ""No.""  Well, boo.I still had to pee.If I didn't have a sense of humor, I'd be pretty angry.  That said, I can't believe how long it took them to respond to our call.  We sat in the cold station for 35 minutes.  People kept walking by staring at us, which really just made me stick my arm through the grate and reach out at them.Anyway, this was a pretty traumatic experience.

306,1,"Mar 29, 2013",At least once a week I see an MBTA bus running a red light...  Pedestrians (like me) need to move quickly to avoid being hit.At least once a week there are significant subway delays or canceled commuter rail trains...Online alerts and LED signs at stations rarely provide accurate  information.There are many days in the winter when the heat doesn't work but the AC is on full blast.Some of the bus drivers and conductors are outright nasty.I moved to Boston 20 years ago.

That is so disinterested in improving their extremely lackluster performance. It's never on time. I am not sure if there is even a schedule. Most employees are rude. They financially try to get over on you on the reg. It is a direct representation of how our state is run. Poorly.
311,1,"Apr 20, 2015",The MBTA SUBWAY is a joke. They make delay announcements in the stations that are inaccurate and so infrequently they can collect revenue from folks who are trying to get to the commuter rail that end up walking. Of course there isn't any refunds offered. We have been dealing with this all winter long and now it looks like we will have to deal with it again all Spring. Do you consider 25 minute delays as minir? I don't.
312,1,"Oct 18, 2006","I arrived at Kenmore at 10:48 pm last night. No one was there waiting, so I assumed I just missed the bus and would have to wait 15-20 minutes. I didn't have the bus schedule on me, but know that the 57 always runs every 15-20 minutes at that time. 30 minutes later about 40 people were waiting and grumbling with me. The bus finally pulled up at 11:19pm. I grabbed a schedule as I boarded the bus and the bus driver humorously commented: ""Picking up some fictional reading, huh?"" The schedule stated there was a 10:45 bus, an 11:00 bus and an 11:20 bus. The 11:00 bus never ran! This is not the first time that a bus never showed up, and I can't fathom how you can just not run a scheduled bus altogether. It's not that it was a few minutes late - IT NEVER CAME. With the recent announcement of the fare hikes, I find it reprehensible that an entire bus route is just skipped, but I have to pay more. Also, I find it amusing that even the bus drivers know the printed schedules are a joke and they are rarely accurate. I have more skipped bus stories and service complaint stories to count.  But I do appreciate that the service is available - even if it isn't consistent.  Generally, it's decent, but I expect the buses to actually show up.EDIT:  Here is a complaint I wrote in to the MBTA this morning, after another skipped bus service.  I am downgrading my rating to 1 star now.  ""My boyfriend and I went to a concert at Harper's Ferry last night.  I got tired and took the car home early.  Tom said he would stay until the concert ended and take the bus home.  We know the 57 schedule and know there are trains until at least 12:30.  The concert got out at about 12:15 am this morning.  Tom waited at the bus stop, but became cold, so started walking home toward Brighton Center.  We live along the 57 route, so he walked along, pausing at each bus stop, hoping to catch the bus the rest of the ride home.  When he finally got home after 1 am, he had not seen one bus pass him, neither inbound nor outbound.  If there are supposedly buses being run at 12:30 in each direction, and according to your schedule it only takes approximately 18 minutes to get from Kenmore to Watertown Yard, how did he not see one single bus on his walk from Brighton Ave through Washington Ave?  This service is despicable.  People count on your service to get them home and instead, they are forced to walk over a mile and a half in the middle of the night. The price increases are an outrage, considering you don't even run bus service after 12:15, even though you say you do.  If driving didn't cost so much, and parking were more readily available, I would boycott the MBTA altogether, given the horrendous service I've experienced.  It's been especially heinous these past few months that I've been living in Brighton.  This is the second time I've complained in two weeks about a missed trip on the 57. I don't often take the 57 because I commute in on the 503.  However, my last experience on the 57 was a skipped bus from Kenmore and now, my boyfriend had to walk home because another bus didn't run.  How can we plan to use the service if two out of the last two times we've tried to take it, it hasn't even run on it's scheduled times???  You're batting 1000 here, but not in a good way."""
313,1,"Nov 25, 2014",The MBTA is the. worst. The idea that anyone would give this operation anything over one star blows my rushed and frenzied mind. I used to show up to work and social functions on time. I prided myself on my punctuality. Now I leave my house for a place that takes me 25 minutes to bike to and arrive in about an hour. On a good day. Green line trains show up in inconsistent waves and packed with flying elbows and disgruntled commuters. Orange line smells like urine and is only marginally better in its organization. And the Red Line seems to choose which doors to leave open based on which side has less people needing to board a train. Boston is a decent city but the MBTA feels like a failed middle schooler's attempt at transiting commuters to and from their daily destinations.
314,3,"Apr 4, 2012","An A-OK public transportation system.The good: It is well organized and reliable. Stops are conveniently located. Between trains and buses, it is possible to get almost anywhere in the city. The Silver Line was a great addition. Fares are reasonable.My wish list: I wish the Green Line didn't stop every two blocks. I wish there were some sort of Red Line-Green Line connector out west so I didn't have to travel 90 minutes or more to get to Newton from Davis (a drive that takes 15-20).""The next train arrives in XX minutes"" signs like they have in DC would be nice. More detailed information on delays would also be nice. ""Attention customers, the Red Line is currently experiencing delays"" can mean anything from ""There was a disabled train earlier but things are back to normal now,"" to ""Things are going to be a bloody mess for the next several hours so don't bother waiting.""In a lot of the cars--it seems like more than half--the intercom either doesn't work or is turned down so low that it's inaudible. This might seem like a non-essential feature, but whenever there is a problem (often) it becomes really, really important. When there is a delay, It doesn't help that the driver is making announcements every two minutes if nobody can hear it.My best example: I was taking the train home from Harvard Square to Davis, as I do nearly every day, and standing on the outbound platform as usual. I was confused when a train pulled in going the opposite direction. it was announced that an outbound train would be coming shortly.When the next train came, it was going in the right direction, so I got on. And waited. And waited. And waited. At least 10 minutes, maybe 15, as the train filled up. No announcements were made (that I could hear). Then, the announcer came over the intercom: ""The next stop for this train will be Central."" WRONG DIRECTION! The train was turning around and going inbound! I hastily exited the train before the doors could close and asked a T worker on the platform if there would be an outbound train coming soon. She rolled her eyes, gestured to the lower platform, and said, ""That train already left. We MADE the announcement."" So, they had inbound trains leaving from the outbound platform, outbound trains leaving from the inbound platform, and a worker standing right on the platform who couldn't be bothered to walk up and down the train making the announcement at the open doors of a waiting train, since the PA system was apparently broken (or not--they managed to announce which station was next!). At that point I just gave up and took the bus instead.The charade they go through every spring--threatening to jack up fares and cut service drastically (e.g., threatening to eliminate all bus lines), holding the legislature hostage until they get their budget funded, which they ultimately always do--is annoying.The commuter rail is pretty good if you are in fact commuting into Boston from the burbs. However, it would be nice if the service were more frequent at off-peak times. It would be nice to be able to take the train to my friends' place in Wakefield on a weekend, but there are trains only every 2 hours or so. If you go to Providence for some Saturday-night fun and want to come back to Boston at the end of the night, you've got to be on the train by 10 p.m. The first train on Sunday isn't until 11:20!!And of course, I wish the T ran 24 hours. I essentially can't take the train to the airport if my flight leaves before 8 or 9 a.m., because the first train is 5:30ish. And if you get in close to midnight, good luck if your flight is delayed at all. You're looking at a $40 cab ride.But all in all, my life is far better with the T than it would be without it."

Try taking the Red Line without a disabled train, signal problem, or more frequently than not...a shuttle bus.  Lately, to get home I have to take the train to  JFK or Broadway only to get off the train, get on a shuttle bus, and get back on a train.  This has happened three or four times in the last month...and it's happening again this weekend.  Oh, and they want MORE money as of this July.

Try living in a ""city"" that is so spread out that there is very little general community--only pocket neighborhoods--and might as well call itself a big town.  A public transport system as integrated as this one is a huge element in making Greater Boston a pedestrian city, and in my view they're not doing badly at all.Oh, and (strangely) except for at Copley station, three times in a row, the agents have all been cool as fuck, quite helpful, and friendly.god bless the MTBA (neither piety nor irony intended).Some of you don't know how good you have it.

But of all the places I've been (L.A., D.C., NYC, Atlanta, Chicago, Dublin, Boston, etc.), Boston has the fastest and most regular system I've seen. Maybe that isn't saying a lot. Maybe all of our systems need overhaul. But I never have to wait long for a train when I'm here, and there's always a station near the places I want to go (even in the near 'burbs), it isn't overly expensive, and it's relatively clean (except for that one station, but we won't talk about that).

Our family of four waited at the stop and our bus blew right past--leaving us waiting 20+ minutes for the next bus (and plenty of time to write this unhappy review)!Thankfully, we don't have a tour time or we'd have missed it. This is a fairly inexpensive option, but not reliable. We've used Uber 4 times while in Boston--the drivers were super nice and available within a few moments--even after a Red Sox game! My advice if you're a visitor using this system: if you need to be somewhere on time, look up your destination's travel route/time and tack on at least 30 more minutes. We had a much easier time with NYC public transit when we visited a few years ago."

The service is extremely slow and poorly designed.The T features outdated subway routes which never run on time or as frequent as they should. The commuter rail is typically 5-10 minutes late. In my 3 years of taking it I don't believe that it's ever been less than 2-3 minutes late. My experiences with the DC metro, Septa, and NYC subway in the past make the T look pathetic."
327,2,"Nov 9, 2011","The MBTA is not bad when it is working.  BUT that is WHEN it is working.   A few weeks ago there was a small snow storm, so the T was shut down between Central and Downtown and we had to take a bus to the next stop but the driver didn't tell us when we were at each stop.  When someone asked why the T was shut down the response from the MBTA worker was ""it is snowing and the elevator is broken"".  I don't know if that makes sense to anyone else.Another time the commuter rail was over 2 hours late and no one showed up to tell the hundreds of morning commuters to find another way to work.  Even an announcement would have made me feel slightly better but we were all left stranded and wondering...ALSO, wayyyyyy too many stop on the buses.

331,3,"Apr 13, 2006","It's weird how the reviews here just plummet after last year.  My major issues with the T are that it shuts down too early and the express trains can make you really friggin' irritated if you have to be somewhere.  I swear some of those bitches on the train even polish smug looks as they blaze past your station without stopping.  I did just read -- in the metro newpaper that they hand out for free (+1 star for real human hands that you can say good morning to consistently) in front of subways stations --  that partially because of our mass transit system, Boston is the second best city to live in just in case we have some crazy oil supply shortage.

Well, I suppose I forgot that#1 This is Americaand#2 Boston just don't give a f*ckEven the Czech Republic has a more efficient system. I want to cry every time I ride the T and that's at least once a day. What is up with the pointless test trains every hour? What needs to be tested so often? What is up with half-full trains that don't stop for no reason whatsoever? What is up with the dirty floors? Do they ever get cleaned? Can they clean them while they test them? Why are the stations so ugly? Why do trains not come for 15 minutes, then 3 at once even going outbound (before street level) Please, someone, overhaul this system. I'm also pretty unhappy with the general geographical area the T travels. First of all, why is there no easy way to get across the river? Why are there stops every 30 feet by BU? Kids can walk. All I can say is, if you think the T is great then you should never travel. Once you go to Europe and see the amazing technology in places like Berlin and Paris (where I lived for a short time - I will kiss the metro the next time I go) you will never be able to withstand the Boston T. It just kills me."
333,4,"Sep 21, 2007","I'm really sad that there's so much hate about the MBTA here. Okay, it's no Chicago El but I would rather have ""semi-reliable"" service (which is very reliable if you're not on the greenline) than a car. Compared to owning a car, it's cheap. The monthly pass that includes unlimited train and bus service is 59 dollars. That's about 1 round-trip a day; on face value, it doesn't seem like a deal. If you make multiple trips a day, or if you make a stop on your way home, however, it will definitely save you money. I live right on the green line so I hardly ever take a bus. I know that they're more unreliable but, hello, it's a bus. Traffic does exist in this world. Overall, it could be better but so could everything else in the universe."

But in all honesty, if you visit other places, you'll quickly come to realize that the T is generally clean, and cheap in comparison to other systems (I'm looking at you NYC). The heavy rail subways (blue, red and orange) move pretty fast, with reasonable frequency. The light rail line (green) is pretty slow, but realistically, the b and c lines could be better served by dedicated bus lanes than by rail. Are there things that they could do better? Yes, of course. But let's give them a little credit for what they do right. Boston is fourth in the country for the percentage of people who use transit, and fares are really low compared to other systems."

The lady I was with, she and I wanted to check out Plymouth Plantation so we caught the Red Line to South Station, caught the commuter rail to Plymouth, took a bus a ways and then walked a few blocks and there we were.  We went everywhere this way and loved it.  You can kind of do that in the SF Bay Area but it is tricky at times.  We loved the versatility and functionality of it and were envious of what a cool system it was."

339,3,"Jan 28, 2008","Talk about a mixed bag. The thought of even trying to write coherent paragraphs about the T makes me want to adopt the rocking fetal position in a corner of the room. Instead, I'll stick with the good, the bad, and the ugly.The good: -The red line has rarely, if ever, let me down. No transportation system is ever going to be perfect, but in my opinion, the red line is the best in Boston as far as staying on schedule, accomodating crowds, and taking you from point A to point B in a reasonable amount of time.-All of the green lines are far from perfect, but I can usually live with the C line. It seems to run more frequently than its green counterparts, and it doesn't take too too long. It also stops at places that I actually need/want to go. Yeah, the D is quick and there aren't many stops, but how often do I really need to go into suburban Newton?The bad: The green B line. Ugh, where to begin. Okay, it's a nice convenience to have a T stop literally steps from my front door, and obviously that beats the alternative of not having one nearby. But living and commuting at Harvard Ave. has to be one of the single most frustrating experiences alive. Back when I used to work in Government Center, it was always a total crapshoot trying to judge when I would arrive at work, particularly if the weather was bad, because apparently Harvard Ave. is the do-or-die cut off point for express trains. I can't tell you how many times I've seen a train stop just up the street, but then blow by the tons of people waiting in the rain, snow, or freezing cold, leaving them with looks on their faces like they're ready to kick Lassie. (There is a flip side to this of course- if you're on the train that gets expressed, seeing the look on those suckers' faces is one of life's small pleasures.) My biggest gripe with the B is its lack of consistency. You just never know what you're going to get with it. The ugly:Goddamn you 66 bus. First, if I wanted to deal with traffic, I would get a car, so that part is my own fault. But how is it that the MBTA STILL has not figured out how to space these things out even somewhat evenly? If I had a nickel for every time I've seen two 66 buses putt-putting up Harvard Ave doggy style, I would be a rich man. It drives me absolutely batshit, to the point where I regularly risk the loss of one or more extremities by walking to work in the freezing cold, rather than wait to see if I will be blessed with the presence of a 66 within a reasonable time frame."
342,2,"Sep 18, 2011","This is the public transportation system in Boston.  It gets you where you need to go...sometimes.  It is slow, and often not on time.  Sometimes it is dirty and there are weird drunk/inappropriate/crazy people riding with you.  Oh well!"
343,3,"Feb 11, 2008","Figuring out how many stars is difficult--I mean, should I rate the MBTA in the context of transportation networks in the U.S.?  In the developed world?  In the known universe?  I couldn't decide, so I averaged the three ratings:Context of the U.S.: 4 stars.  The major plusses are:- Racially and socioeconomically integrated!  After living in Boston for a while, I had forgotten than in America, white people drive, and people of color people take the bus.  Recent trips to Philly and DC made me appreciate that in Boston, people with the means to own a car do not see taking public transportation as slumming, and melaninically-challenged people do not have an aversion to being locked into a passenger cabin with blacks or latinos.- Inexpensive! Granted, for just 30 cents more, you can travel anywhere on the much more extensive NYC subway, but compared to any other city in the U.S., it's hard to get somewhere far and get there efficiently for only $1.70.- Decent connection to the airport! Both the blue line and the silver line bus, which, for a bus, is pretty sweet, more or less go to the airport, and with enough frequency and consistency that you're not going to miss a flight because you got unlucky with the T.  To get to the airport in San Francisco you have to take the infrequent BART, and in DC you can't get there (there = Dulles) yet, and in Philly it's really expensive and the rest of the transportation system sucks so unless you live near where the airport train goes, it's difficult.   Major minuses:- Silly, silly layout.  Yes, the T has to deal with the cow-path-based geography of Boston, and yes, it was built incrementally rather than conceived of rationally as an integrated system, but just because it's not the current T's fault that its layout is lousy doesn't mean it doesn't get docked for it.  I mean, the orange and green lines downtown are a friggin' block away from each other?  Why not space them out so you can cover more of the downtown?  Also, stops on the green line (mainly the B and C) are unnecessarily close together.- No express trains.  This is especially a problem on the green line, where, due to stops at intersections, trains frequently get bunched up at busy times.  Occasionally, the crowded, slow train in the front will declare itself an express train and skip a couple stops, which makes eminent sense, but there really should be a more regular system of expressness.- Buses are infrequent and don't stick to the schedule.  Taking the bus is workable if one of the following is true: (1) you have tons of time on your hands and a book of crosswords; (2) the bus picks you up on schedule and drops you off on schedule.  This requires planning on your part, but even in the cell-phone age, most of us can still do it; or (3) the bus is frequent enough so it doesn't matter if there's no schedule or it doesn't follow it.  Unless (1) applies, MBTA buses with a few exceptions are not workable.  Sometimes they're early, sometimes they're late, sometimes they're so late that it's as if they were early.- Stops at 12:30.  In most of the U.S., people drive drunk all the time.  This happens less in Boston thanks to the T, but if it ran later on Friday and Saturday (like the usually-stopping-at-12:30-but-staying-open-till-3:00-on-weekends DC metro does), we'd all be better off.  Fund the later weekend hours with a 1-dollar surcharge on drinks dispensed after midnight--people will be happy to pay a few more bucks when staying out late if they then save big on cab fare.Context of the developed world: 2 stars   Major pluses:Eh, not many.  It's not a complete loss, so it gets more than just one star.  But come on, three train lines, one of which nobody uses (blue line), a couple streetcars (green lines), worthless buses--just this for what's supposed to be a second-tier world-class city?  Major minuses:As you can see, some of the minuses have been included in the pluses section, so here's a list w/o explanation:- Usually quicker to ride your bike.  If the weather weren't so awful in the winter and Americans didn't have an aversion to biking to work, no one would bother with the T.- Bumpy, jerky, rickety old rails and trains.  The U.S. may be the richest country in the world, but you'd have no idea and you'd lobby your government to be more generous with its foreign aid if all you saw of America were the MBTA.- The MBTA has the chutzpah to pretend that the Silver Line is the equal of the actual rail lines.  The comfort and efficiency of a bus, at the price of a subway!- Seriously, mold colonies in Europe and Japan have better transit systems. Context of the known universe: 3 stars.  Damn, this is way too long already, but you get the picture."

I got a 7 day pass ($18), which I used only for a few days, but was well worth it. Getting from point A to point B to point C in only a few minutes, and not being stuck in traffic! The wait for the next train was never more than 5 minutes. BONUS at one of the stations, their was a guy playing a bass guitar for tips. He was pretty damn good! As for complaints... 1) Never use the elevator! I rode in 2 different elevators at 2 different stations and they both smelled like urine! My advise, don't be lazy and TAKE THE STAIRS! LOL! 2) Don't rush, leave a little early! One morning we had Duck Boat Tour and had to make it to the Prudential Convention CTR, but one of the trains had mechanical problem. Instead of waiting, we walked from Kenmore Square. It took about 30 minutes. So be prepared! 3) A couple of times we had trouble with our tickets. Once, my ticket got stuck and keep on going in and out of the turnstile machine. I had grab it and yank it out. Another time, my wifes ticket didn't even work. Luckily a janitor was present, he let us in. So would I recommend MBTA? YES!!! I know I have a few complaints, but the positives out weight the negatives. Whenever I go on a vacation, I always drive and navigating through traffic for hours on end, which feels like work. So just hanging on and enjoying the ride, now that's my kind on vacation."
346,3,"Dec 7, 2010","I took the commuter rail from South Station to Foxboro for the Patriots/Jets game (GO PATS!) and it was alright. They guarantee an arrival to Gillette one hour before kick off and we got there at 8pm for an 830pm kick off. Because of the long entry/security lines, we barely got to our seats by the time the teams came on to the field.  It left 30 minutes after game time, as promised, but once we started up we stopped and just sat on the train for a solid 20-25 minutes without any announcement. That's my biggest pet peeve with the T - lack of communication. I can handle delays if I know what's up!  I would definitely recommend going to South station to board if you have the time. It fills up quickly. All that being said, it's a relaxing ride where you can close your eyes and not worry about traffic. I would take it again in a heart beat."
347,2,"Aug 11, 2014","The service sometimes sucks, especially the green line. There's no schedule when the subway train is going to come, and sometimes I have to wait for a while. I remembered I was late for class because of the train. The mbta should know that there are people who has places to go to, and majority of them go to work or school in Boston. Therefore, we can't afford to be late. Another factor is that some of the conductors are rude to the passengers. I remembered a conductor won't let my friend go into the subway because he ""doesn't look like a soldier"" when he's clearly in his uniform AND showed him his military ID! SERIOUSLY?!? I've been on the subway for years and I've never heard anything like that. My friend have no problem passing through as long he showed them his ID (which is a policy I saw looking through their website); conductor let soldiers go in for free as long they show them their military ID. But this conductor was so rude to him! I also have other very rude and weird stories while I was on the mbta.And the cost for the mbta is expensive as well. However, thank god they have discounts and passes for making a commuter's life easier. Anyhow, it's whatever for me because I only use it for transportation to go somewhere I need to go if it's a long walk.If you wanna take the subway, green line is the slowest and comes in randomly. Other lines are a bit better."
348,1,"Jun 4, 2014","A BELIEVE IT OR NOT: On MBTA Bus Route 60 from Kenmore to Chestnut Hill, there is an official, announced stop for 850 Boylston, a Brigham and Women's facility on the other side of Boylston. The bus stops at a guard rail(!) next to the sidewalk, with no crosswalk (!), forcing all who get off either to walk on Route 9 (!) back to the nearest crosswalk (which is also at the previous T stop), jump that guardrail to the sidewalk and walk back to the crosswalk, or to dash across Route 9 to the medical building. ""AMBULANCES ARE STANDING BY, FOLKS!"""
349,1,"May 19, 2010","""due to thursday's incident at downtown crossing, we are operating with delays in service ... ""the preceding announcement was actually broadcast at red line stations for a week and a half after the 'incident' in question took place (it was an electrical fire). this, in spite of the surprising fact that the T seemed to run uncharacteristically smoothly in the days that followed. it's almost as though the managers decided to leave the announcement in place to be milked in the event the system did actually run up against all its standard glitches (""signal problems,"" ""disabled trains up ahead,"" etc.). the above announcement and its factual context seem to encapsulate nearly everything wrong with T. you have the decrepit equipment failing and sparking subsequent delays in service, the vague announcements that do little to educate you on the hold-ups, thereby making it hard to estimate how late you're going to be to wherever you're going, and a breed of apathy bordering on willful contempt for passengers. other good stuff: orange line trains that seem to run on a schedule consistent with the passing of halley's comet, a B train choked up all bottleneck-like with a series of stops within about a block of each other leading up to the green line's busiest intersection, and buses that run so out of whack with schedule that it's not at all uncommon to see a merry caravan of two or three of the same bus going the same route spaced within a car or two of one another."
350,2,"May 27, 2014",One of the less efficient and reliable subway systems compared to others in the USA and abroad. Most of the drivers are rude and do not have the skills/training to deal with a multicultural/diverse population in Boston. Delayed service most of the time. Insufficient trains to serve a growing population resulting in packed trains during peak service hours. This subway system is not at level as it should be for an important city as Boston. Disappointing overall.
351,2,"Sep 9, 2010","Just some commentary, having ridden on many public transport systems throughout the world. Ours is not the worst, but far from good.  Each city presents its own logistic challenges in terms of topography, and population, but the T just doesn't seem to want to make itself work.  A couple of necessary improvements: 1. gotta run till 2:30--- (a huge part of taking transport is to prevent driving drunk..running till 2:30 would be a huge economic boon to the T as well as establishments in downtown Boston.   2.  Circle line--- though expensive, a circle line running from somerville-brighton/brookline-JP-South End/Back Bay-Cambridge would unify multiple lines and give a myriad of options to the rider.  Suddenly it would make sense for tens of thousands more people to ride the t.  3.  Better Stations-- kiosks, smoothies, bars, convenience stores provide money making opportunities for the mbta, and a much better ride for the consumer.  Kill 2 birds with one stone.  4.  easiest fix of all..PLEASE cut the number of stops at BU in half.  SO unnecessary.  Other pipe dreams include burying the greenline, quieter tracks and trains, and maybe a couple more cameras so  the thugs actually feel like they are being watched."
354,4,"Oct 8, 2011","Living near Baltimore and D.C, I have to say during a weekend trip to Boston using the T, I was impressed with how clean the public transportation system is in Boston.  The stations were clean as well.  Big fan."
355,1,"Mar 20, 2014","Oh MBTA how you fail the commuters of Boston in so many ways. Even when you say you will try harder it seems like it's just more of the same. Why can't you be more efficient in your daily work to make sure we can get to where we need to in a timely fashion. I believe that every T employee should be required to take the T. Then they would go through the same bs the rest of us do. I don't understand why it's so difficult to get things done in a timely fashion. You basically have to take people from point A to point B. Yet you find it so damn difficult, whether via train or bus there's always something that comes up. It is so frustrating & makes it difficult to not be constantly annoyed due to these circumstances. So many other cities don't run into even a 1/4 of the problems you do. You think all these fare hikes are what's going to solve the T's money problems, it's not. Making service actually happen w/put so many issues should be your primary focus. There isn't a day that goes by that problems don't arise on every single line & that is ridiculous & completely unacceptable."
356,1,"Mar 12, 2016","Unreliable, dirty, overcrowded and really, really slow. For the quality of service they provide, the T is way over-priced."

On that next train, some shyster came along the car, yelling about how he was in a drug rehab program, had effed up his life, and needed money. Seriously?! I had to walk past four other people all begging for money today on the way to your damn ride, and now I'm held captive? You really gotta get these guys outta here. I'm all for helping the homeless, but I recognize the druggies and the drunks by now, and I don't appreciate that they're at every turn at North Station. Can't you protect your riders?"

Well, it's standard policy, and there's nothing they can do about it ! Ridiculous !"
361,2,"Aug 11, 2013","Lack of service on weekends when tourism is your 4th strongest money maker, you suck. Trains are dirty and the platforms are a disgusting mess with equal stench. The fact you have no discounts for disabled vistors and only your own residents show you do not give a damn. The free AT&T WI FI, what a freaking joke on for two seconds then you have to reconnect, save your money and lower fares. The markings and signs for a visiting person was non existent, we had no idea the platform the Worcester train was coming in on and could not find a soul to ask and we pushed the button on the call box and it rang and rang and rang and rang then stopped."
362,2,"Jul 8, 2008","I give the T two stars because it's not all horrible.  At the right times, it actually gets me where I need to be relatively quickly.  I live across the street from a T, and my school was across the street from the same T, so in that sense it was always very convenient.  I have huge gripes about their Greater Boston service.  It should not be an epic journey every single time someone in Allston/Brookline travels to Cambridge.  On a bike or in a car, it takes me approx 15-20 minutes to get to Cambridge, on the T it can take me an hour and at times has taken me two hours.  TWO AGONIZING HOURS.  Seriously, I'm not going to New Hampshire.The worst is their late night service.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that on Saturday nights they run a last T at 1:45am.  I don't know if this is for all lines, but it's taken me home a few times, usually after I see a bus thinking it's the last one and then am forced to sit there for an hour and a half waiting for it to leave, annoyed that I left whatever I was doing at midnight to catch this fucking stupid bus which wasn't going to leave until nearly 2AM anyway.  They also don't run this service on Friday nights.  Or any other night for that matter.  Which is just inconsistent and annoying.My favorite T story:  I was riding home from Central Square to Brookline and instead of taking my ordinary route (#1 bus) I took the red line to avoid the possibility of missing my transfer.  Luckily for me, the last C was waiting at Park St and I was like ""Yeahhh going homeee!""  Well, we got to Kenmore, they ejected everybody from the train, claimed ""out of service,"" and drove off.  Another T did not come for OVER AN HOUR.  Not another C, another T.  PERIOD.  If I were smart, I would have split the cab with a bunch of people going to Washington Square, but I was stubborn (I'd paid my fare, the T should take me home, why spend the extra $$?) so I ended up taking the B because it was the first train I saw and I didn't trust that there would be a C or D coming, and walked 30 minutes at 2AM from the B line to my house.  I didn't get home til 2:30AM and had checked my clock in Central Square at 12:15AM right before I left.  I could have walked home faster!  This was not the only time it took me two hours to get from point A to point B because of the T, but it was definitely the worst.  (And I must note that this does not count the amount of times my ""stop requests"" have been blatantly ignored or I've been left out in the cold with arms full of groceries/whatever because the bus / T has chosen not to stop at its stop, JUST missed a bus that does not show up for an additional HOUR, I've been late for school/work/everything because of unannounced and unpredicted detours or construction or shuttle buses, so on and so forth... the list goes on.)Ugh, just thinking about the time the T has stolen from my life!  It makes me hate the world."
363,1,"Dec 17, 2010",Truly lacks the wisdom that you would expect with such age. It seems that its administrators never bother to understand why their customer's think so little of the T. Their mapping system should be upgraded to one standard instead of the mix of horizontal (in-train) and vertical (in-station) orientations. They can't blame the tourists for being clueless when the system directories are so disorganized.The buses are another story: What's the point of having clocks on the bus when the operators often run early and late for no apparent reason?
366,2,"Dec 4, 2011","Like the extent of the coverage, but the user experience is lacking.  The green line trains that are super-slow and often late used to bother me, but lately, it has to do with the bus system.  Started over a year ago when my car was nearly squashed by a bus near the downtown Boston library- which was cutting across turning lanes, illegally.   Also followed by the driver flying me a big old bird.   My email to the MBTA went unanswered.Last week it was that I was waiting at the bus stop in plain view and the driver blew right by me.  Again, email feedback went unanswered.  If you want riders, the drivers need to stop and pick them up."
367,2,"Jul 17, 2014","I have used public transit in over 20 countries and this is one of the worst. Commuter rail is often late. So far there has only been one day in July (out of 17) where neither inbound or outbound train were late. It's too hot, too cold, signal problems, switch problems, conductor problems, engineer problems, something different every day.Commuter trains can only be boarded at certain doors. That's the most idiotic setup I've ever seen. It takes longer to exit and board a train at a busy station then with a Boeing 737. The doors are typically dependent on how many and where conductors are, so the passengers are left to guess. There is often a ""get to the open door"" stampede on the platform. Number of cars and configuration of cars changes day to day for the same train for no apparent reason.The only ""known good"" door is at the platforms which enable level entry. The platforms are Back Bay and South Stations are as far away from the station entrance as possible so everyone who actually needs the platform (disabled, strollers, heavy luggage) must walk the whole length of the platform. To make matters worse, the train often misses the platform, so the whole crowd needs to shuffle off the platform and climb in through the stairs anyway. The Trains technically have WIFI but it almost never works. Commuter trains have almost no signage and require ""insider knowledge"". There isn't a single sign anywhere at the Back Bay station platform. No schedule, no train indicator, no message board not even a clock. NOTHING. There only a bunch of bull horns that garble unintelligible messages. Apparently the first car after the engine is a ""quiet car"" but again there is absolutely no sign indicating that this is the case and what it actually means.Last week a friend of mine had to get to the airport and since it was during rush I recommended the train to South Station + Silver Line. Bad choice: there is no place to store even a regular sized carry on bag. The train had a problem a, stopped prematurely at Yawkey and all passengers got booted off with no help and/or further instructions on how to continue from there. My friend was lucky enough to find a friendly local to help him on his way but he didn't get on his flight anyway.It's not all bad though: the trains are clean and in reasonably good shape. Seating  is tight but workable, although sometimes the train is so full that there is only standing room. The conductors tend to be friendly and nice. It's also very expensive. My commute  of 22 miles one way costs ca. $21 round trip. 10 pass cost exactly 10 times as much."
368,2,"Apr 20, 2007","How can I complain about public transportation that saves me the hassle of driving in this town, saves me from spending my discretionary income on taxis (so affordable in Chicago, but not in Boston), and thus helps preserve our environment?  In my informal, unscientific study of the T, I find that 80% of the time I am *just* missing the C line.  So I take the D line instead, which seems to run more cars, which is great but some idiot conductor stops short at the Longwood stop.  This makes the second car run over the wooden boards that were laid between the tracks so us paying users can walk from one side to the other.  This usually happens when I'm on the wrong side of the track so I have to hurdle over the rails.  Thanks.  I also love this female conductor for screaming at me when I use the back doors to enter.  A) I just had to hurdle over the tracks thanks to your poor spacial judgment.  B) In all the years I've taken the D line, there is something called Show and Go! C) You don't have to be a raving banshee.  I'll swipe my frakkin' Charlie Card when I get it out of my bag.  I can't grab my lovely card AND hurdle at the same time.  That's just my morning commute.  The afternoon commute usually consists of just missing the C or E at North Station, and having to wait 15-20 minutes, sometimes 30 min. if there's something wrong with the tracks, etc.  Or I just about make it to the door, and wham, they slam it shut in your face.  Don't tell me that this never happened to you.  If it's not happening to me, I'm watching it happen to you.  It's like the conductors live to do this."

371,1,"Apr 21, 2014","Worth 1/2 star.Worst subway system ever !!Expensive: 11 Bucks for 1 day unlimited ride ! And $18 for 7 days.So when you stay for 2 or 3 days like i did you feel quite stupid.I have been using the subway in NYC for months and it is by far such a smarter and more efficient network. Boston should get inspired by it.Moreover you have to step a few stairs in norder to get from the platform to the subway floor. Another way to loose precious space in rush hours.Also for outdoor station you will have to queue so everyone can vadlidate its ticket at the SIngle machine near the driver. Just like in bus you will tellme, except that here, it is a mass transportztion vehicle.After loosing space, the mbta this is a good lesson on how loose time stupidly. It feel like you are riding the subway a few decades ago.Another important point, the govermznt center station. This station is closed and will be that way for 2 years. But no f***ing signs tell you that, neither on the platform or in the train. You will just have to wait until the last moment, when the driver tell you it won't stop there.With such an under-developed and not reliable system, I understand why so many people use their cars in this town.Well done mtba !!"

It is however clean, safe, and convenient for us with no car and little money for a cab.  I wish it hadn't increased to $1.25 because digging for that extra quarter is a hassle, but it's still cheap.  Wish it didn't shut down between 1 and 5am.  It's clearly not the NY subway, but it works.  A major overhaul would cost millions and millions... maybe one day."

But I have to get into Boston someway, and it's relatively cheap and runs pretty frequently and there's heaters at the stations, so I can't complain about being to cold. But ewwwwww. Also, is *every* T stop being rennovated right now? What the heck?"
374,2,"Dec 7, 2007","I was spoiled big time when I lived in Paris. While no public transit system is going to be 100% on time and without issues, the Metro definitely kicks the MBTA's inefficient ass all over the place.Unlike the Metro, the T doesn't have many access points. So, its difficult to live in a lot of areas in the city without having to walk 3 miles or resort to buying a car. If you are lucky enough to live near a station, that's great - but with all the weird 'technical difficulties' that the T seems to have on a daily basis, I sometimes wonder whether it would take me less time to walk from Cambridge to Downtown Boston. I'll be fair though - the Red Line isn't too bad. It holds a lot of  people, tends to show up more often than never, and is way faster than the pitiful Green Line. But you have to wonder what is going on when it suddenly stops dead in the middle of a tunnel for no apparent reason. Sometimes you'll get on a train with a driver who isn't half stoned, so they'll make an announcement to let you know what's up. That doesn't happen too often though. So, most of the time, you just sit there (or stand there) for what seems like an eternity, wondering if you'll ever see the light of day again.I have to say though...the reason why this review gets only two stars is because of the Green Line. Seriously, if I could give, like negative 10 stars, this is what I would give it to. The Green Line is slow, seems to show up randomly, and doesn't hold many passengers. You should see the chaos that ensues during the morning commute at Park Street. The young, spry Red Line keeps coming into the station, letting out loads of zombie-like commuters, who all trek right up to the Green Line platform. A lot of times, they will join the throng of other zombie-like commuters who are already there - still waiting for at least one..one single train to show up. Its amazing how long you can wait there...the minutes go by languidly, which makes the crowd swell even more. When a train finally rolls in, the stampede commences and nothing is safe any longer. At this point, come to terms with the fact that it will take you even longer to get to work, because now you have to wait for everyone to pack into the train, leave the station, and then go to the next station, where even more people will try to pack in (while others try to leave the train - a very difficult thing to do on such mornings.)Don't even get me started on the section of the Green Line where the train has to stop at intersections. Helloooo.....can we say BUS?! I thought that this was supposed to be a subway system?!Anyway, if you can, try to just take the Red Line - maybe forget about most of Boston entirely and just come and hang out in Cambridge. It's a great place to be - cute restaurants, bars, etc. Not only that, there is some chance that you might actually get there in time to meet up with your friends. If you insist on trekking a couple miles over the river though, make sure to give yourself like two hours to get there. With the Green Line as your mode of transport, you'll need it."
375,1,"Jan 18, 2009","The RED LINE SUCKS! when you get on the 8:25am train on a Monday morning and it sits there in the middle of rush hour because of some mechanical mishap that happens, to have happened for the past four MONDAYS IN A ROW it's like ""seriously you had all Sunday to make sure these piece of crap trains would be in working condition for the Monday rush."" then the past few Fridays I've noticed that people have bee riding home on the trains in complete darkness. With parking in Boston so ridiculously expensive, $11-16 dollars a day, you have no choice but deal with there BS... which wouldn't be so bad, if they actually at least made it LOOK like they cared or are working out the kinks but they make it seem like pushing a button to make a train go and announcing a stop is sooo tiring. Not to mention when they act like they're doing YOU a favor when they bother to announce whats going on with a broken down car instead of just letting you sit there for 15-20 minutes without saying anything like they usually do. I swear we need to get together and stage a boycott...and do a city wide car pool month....That'll learn em'"
378,1,"Apr 3, 2011","The MBTA is ridiculous and awful. The rates keep going up for abominable service. I won't get into the MBTA workers, because I generally try to avoid them and understand that they are probably overworked and underpaid, but many people I know have issues with their attitude.Let me say that I have lived in the Boston area my whole life and have always used the train. I remember when you still had to use tokens, the service was good, it was easier sneak on, etc etc.The new T system is a complete scam. Machines don't accept pennies, give back Sacagaweas and eat money all the time. The validation machines are bogus because they put a time limit on your verification--since when does my money expire from trying to convenience others by not using the machine? Second, it has gotten to the point where you must plan your day around your transportation. You must schedule fifteen minutes of waiting time into your plans, plus, I don't think I'm exaggerating when I say up to 30 minutes from inconveniences such as broken switches and other BS we have to put up with.I also really love it when I see someone knocking on the door of a bus or train, begging the driver to open it for them and they keep going. Also when you ask to get off at a stop and they tell you that you have to press the request line--You have a control pad in front of you. Isn't that your job, asshole? This is absolutely unacceptable and ridiculous behavior and it is going unpunished. Lastly, if you're not going to run 24/7, there should not be this many glitches all the time. What are you doing for those hours that the T is closed, because from my experience, maintenance has taken place during the afternoon, rush hour and other times that really seem to stick it to the people.In short, I hope that someone posts the current president of the MBTA's phone number for the public so that we can all call him and tell him what a scam artist he is and what a terrible thing he is doing to our city."
379,1,"Mar 15, 2016","I wish that yelp would allow people to put a zero star review, because I would gladly do so. The MBTA is one of the most, if not the most, terribly organized and managed organization that I have ever seen. I really cannot comprehend how they are almost bankrupt, considering that they are running 20 year old buses, 35+ year old trains, pay their employees about 60k a year, and just raised the fare to $2.80. It is ridiculous. Another big issue is the safety of these trains; just a few weeks ago, TWO Orange Line trains began smoking, and people began to break windows and jump out to avoid suffocation. There has not been a single day, in my 3 years of riding the T, that there has not been a delay on one of the 4 subway/trolley lines. The old trains that they keep running (because they are ""out of money""), are always breaking down, and the stations are not well maintained. Remember those smoking trains I was talking about? Well, that was because a metal panel fell of the side of a train, and shorted out the third rail and the electronics in the train, causing it to smoke. Then, after the first train smoked out the station, it left, and nobody decided to turn off the third rail and remove the panel. I bet you can guess what happened next; yet ANOTHER train came into the station, and the train and third rail shorted out. The employees are lazy, over-payed, and think they are entitled, just because they are the ones getting you from point A to point B, even if that involves inhaling smoke for 5 minutes straight. Don't even get me started about the buses. Just today, the bus was supposed to leave Alewife Station (where the route begins) at 3:30, and it didn't come until 3:50. At around 3:32, two buses had ""79"" on the front of the bus, ready to take passengers. One of the two bus drivers changed his sign to say ""Out of Service"" and drove off. The other bus driver decided it would be a fine idea to just pull the bus over, turn it off, get out, and enjoy her coffee break. To wrap things up after this long review; if you plan on moving to Boston, and taking the MBTA daily, say goodbye to your wallet, lungs, and brain cells, because all of them will be gone after a few months."
380,4,"Jul 22, 2005","Both the T and the commuter rail are pretty reliable. It gets hefty for me riding the T into boston, because I live in the suburbs, and going into the city from Newton, I pay $3.00. The commuter rail gets you to Boston faster than the T...coming back outbound taking the commuter rail, you should ask and make sure that you're getting on the right one. I've gotten on the wrong one a bunch of times, and its really inconvenient, because the commuter rail doesn't run that often.   For the T, Green line, it gets pretty crazy on game days for the Sox because everyone takes the T to get to Fenway, so you might have trouble getting onto a train."

Driving is usually the worst. However, if you're in downtown Boston and aren't going all that far, you might as well just walk. The stops are only a couple blocks apart. The green line in particular is the worst with cars breaking down, arriving late, being overcrowded, etc."

386,1,"Jan 27, 2016","I've lived in Boston for my whole life. Everything is pretty nice in the city, but then there's the MBTA. Literally, nothing is worse than the MBTA. Even Hell probably has better transport systems than this city. One time, I was going to the Museum of Science via the green line. I wasn't really going though, because I had to wait for over an hour at one station to go two stops. At the next stop, they said ""this train is going out of service."" People on the train said ""They're not actually going to kick us off right?"" Through years of ""riding"" the MBTA, I knew that it would be their mission to make sure everybody left the train, even though we were all going one stop ahead. I then sat in the leaking, dirty, crumbling station for another 15 mins, and then a train went right through the station. People were flagging it down, but little did they know, the MBTA doesn't serve anybody. After another half-hour of waiting, the train finally came and what should have taken 10 mins ended up taking over 2 hours. We missed the iMax at the museum. I'm glad they're raising the fares!"

390,1,"Dec 10, 2015","We used the train to ride from Framingham to Downtown Boston (South Station) and back to Framingham. While the ride itself was not unpleasant, for such a large metropolitan area the seamlessness of purchase left much to be desired, and the visual systems lacking needed information. An additional column indicating arrival time AND departure time would help eliminate confusion for travelers. Additionally, the staff had literally no desire to be helpful. We purchased one way tickets after being told the cost would be the same, but we're surprised to be charged an extra $9 for purchasing our tickets from downtown. What a serious disappointment considering the ride is $8.50 per person. The attendant rudely said it was said numerous times at the station... Perhaps, among the bustling shops, large crowds, etc., but it went unnoticed even after missing our first train, waiting 40 minutes, and all of us have a pretty high attention to detail. My take on it was there's no good reason for this extra fee other than greedy nonsense, and the rudeness was the icing on the cake to leave me with the feeling that the train ride, while lacking, was nothing like my awesome experiences on BART and other metro transits. Lesson learned, looks like we paid for an extra person!"
391,1,"Aug 4, 2014","The MBTA is the worst public transportation system I have ever experienced. I have lived, spent significant time in or visited New York, D.C., San Francisco, Chicago, London, Paris, Madrid and Barcelona. Your trains are old and antiquated, worn out, leaky, rusted and loud just for starters. The fact is this is the only subway system that does not run trains at 2 minute intervals during rush hour. 7 - 10 minute splits results in overloaded trains, long lines and daily frustration. In London, trains run every minute at Oxford Circus, a major hub.  This is only city where I see people running to trains every day, pushing and shoving, being told repeatedly by frustrated drivers to clear the platform.  It is your poorly run system that causes bad behavior among riders.  Barcelona's trains are large, and fast. People can stand 4 across between the seats.  I went from Central Barcelona to the suburbs in under 25 minutes.  It takes 45 minutes to an hour to get to Downtown Crossing from Wellington, 5 miles, and I often have to wait for a second or third train. It's the same on the return trip.  This should be a 20 minute ride at worst.   It takes 17 minutes in New York from 137th to 59th on the One Line, 5.3 miles. The New York trains run according to schedule. I have no idea when MTBA trains run. It's different every day.  This system needs new trains in addition to new stations. More stations will just clog the system more.  Whoever is in charge of city planning is a moron.  A 15-year old using Sim City as a guide could design a more efficient system.  The Chamber of Commerce should stop attempting to portray Boston as a major city until it can transport its citizens like other true major cities.  BTW-The Green and Silver lines are trolleys, not subway trains. In San Diego, the trolley takes you from downtown to San Ysidro in 45 minutes.  It would take at least 2 hours to go the same distance on the Green Line.  And the price just went up $5 a month.   This is what the New York MTA is doing: http://web.mta.info/capital/. Where is our money going?"
392,3,"Aug 19, 2014","With all the engineering and scientific talent within a 95-mile radius (Harvard, MIT, Wentworth, the UMass campuses, etc.), you would THINK that the MBTA would be the MOST efficient, MOST technically-advanced transit system in the country, if not the world. Instead, the whole system,but especially the Green Line, Silver Line and Commuter Rail WREAK of a ""Is this really the best we can do?!"" stench. Let's talk briefly about these three biggest stinkers:a) Green LineA recent ""Trains Magazine"" article about modern streetcar systems in this country (July, 2014) didn't even mention the MBTA's Green Line because, guess what, no part of it is MODERN. So, you say, ""Fair enough--as America's first subway it has a lot of old charm,"" except that that's not the case EITHER. If you look at San Fran's or New Orleans's streetcar/trolley networks you get the old charm feeling--the Green Line just kind of EXISTS. It's not like the MBTA even TRIED to keep ANY of the charm either:*Wherease NYC Transit takes PRIDE in the original mosaic artwork and tiling at many underground stations, the T walled OVER them with bland white walls.*Park Street had the most charming, yes charming, green lampshades on the Green Line level--they replaced them with ugly ""office style"" fluorescent lighting.*The T does very little to hype the Mattapan ""High Speed"" Line, the Red Line's extension from Ashmont to Mattapan. This best-kept-secret utilizes the old PCC cars which also ran on the Green Line through the mid-1980s.b) Silver LineIf you looked up ""bustitution"" in the dictionary, next to it should be a picture of a Silver Line bus, for the Silver Line continues the MBTA's long tradition of convincing inner-city residents that replacing fast, truly ""rapid"" rail transit with an effing bus somehow makes things ""more"" efficient:*A-train, which split off from the B at Packard's Corner and ran to Watertown Square, scrapped for the 57 bus. *E-train semi-permanently truncated from Arborway/Forest Hills to Heath Street for the 39 bus. When the traffic is bad they short-turn the trains even further up the line at Brigham Circle. It's not like the 39 buses don't ALSO get stuck in traffic so why not offer people a one-seat-ride out of JP?*The Washington Street Elevated Orange Line was scrapped for the 49 bus, which became the Washington Street Silver Line. This was after years of promising some of the lowest-income residents in the City in Lower Roxbury that it would be a light rail line (trolley/streetcar) line. Numerous environmental and transit watchdog groups have derided the so-called ""Bus Rapid Transit"" Silver Line as being one of the worst such implementations of BRT in the WORLD!*Forget linking two major rapid transit lines, the Red and Blue--instead let's use what little money that came from the Big Dig that was earmarked for public transit to build a brand new tunnel for buses to run through it at 10 mph and change power mode halfway to the Airport.c) The Commuter Rail, a-k-a ""Purple Line."" Where. Do. I. Start? I've ranted and raved on numerous blogs, including my own about how, the Commuter Rail needs to start, yes start, to electrify. I've heard every excuse in the book; and I have an answer for them all:*What's the point?Electric trains are faster, quieter and much more environmentally-friendly. Back Bay Station in particular should be the SHAME of the entire system, with dozens of locomotives belching diesel into the station throughout the day.*Who's going to maintain the equipment since the MBTA facilities have no overhead wiring? Really? That's like 5th grade mentality. BUILD the facilities!Certainly $500 million could've gone a long way towards building electric maintenance bays, with enough change left over to start electrifying at least the Fairmount Line, rather than blow it on reopening the Greenbush Line--which wasn't even PROJECTED to bring in a decent passenger volume.*Where's the equipment going to come from?This speaks volumes about the MBTA's procurement process in general--why does the MBTA need brand new ANYTHING?! For the most cash-strapped public transit agency in the country, why not take ""certfied pre-owned"" equipment from Metro-North and NJ Transit, give it a mid-life overhaul and run it for another 20 years. SURELY that make more sense than running what you've got INTO THE GROUND, causing numerous delays and the infamous double-trains. Oh, wait, because the MBTA tries to compete with the Joneses and buy brand new cars all the while still using old, diesel-belching locomotives. You're right, MBTA, people want brand new, shiny cars--not locomotives that won't start or go but then stall out. I had to laugh when, with the orders for the new locomotives falling behind, the MBTA was forced to lease used-but-very-functional ones from MARC. Throw some old Metro-North M-4s and M-6s on the Providence Line and start electrifying the rest of the syste"
393,3,"May 17, 2013","Ah, finally, my review of the MBTA! It's kind of one of those things that you think about for days, weeks even--what do I even start with? What to focus most of my attention on? Is this even worth it? But here goes . . .I've been riding the MBTA, the ""T,"" for over three decades. I just feel the need to throw that out there to distinguish myself from the transplants who have that ""one bad ride"" and want to flame the entire system. You know what--nobody and nothing is perfect. I've ridden every mode of the MBTA extensively except the Ferry--I'm not basing this review off of one bad ride on the ""B"" Line.#1 PUBLIC TRANSIT IS PUBLIC TRANSIT (IN THE U.S.A.)Public transit in the U.S. stinks. That's a fact. Metaphorically speaking it's a constant tug-of-war between Conservative-leaning politicians (and their constituents) who see little to no value in it other than ""another wasteful Government program to help the poor"" and Liberal-leaning politicians who see little to no value in it other than to pander to their constituents who value it for one or more of the following:*Environmentally-friendly*Sanity-saving over sitting in traffic (in a personal vehicle)*Avoiding exorbitant parking fees at their destination*Moving a car and losing a parking space (especially after a snowstorm)Thus, when Transit System X tries to make improvements, you get Conservative politicians who staunchly oppose as little as a $0.005 (yes 1/2-cent) tax increase to help cover it; and when the Liberal politicians push it through, only about 1/3 of if actually gets funneled toward improvements (the remainder goes to pay down various debt). Thus, the MBTA, like most other transit systems in this country, comes up broke every year, and every other year gets forced to raise fares even though raising fares doesn't account for even HALF of revenue stream. Sound familiar?#2 THE MBTA SQUANDERS WHAT LITTLE MONEY IT DOES HAVESo that little bit of money that comes from taxes and tax increases that actually DOES make it to the MBTA--where does it go?! I think what confounds me, and others who've lived in the Greater Boston Area long enough, is that the T is one of the LEAST expansionary systems in the country, and, what little money it did have for expansions in the last 20 years (after the Red Line Extensions to the North and South) got funneled into A. the Greenbush Commuter Rail Line, which nobody wanted and, even worse, created more congestion at an already-congested South Station,and B. the Silver Line, part of which was the greatest lie ever told in the City (should've been light rail vehicle service), and the rest of which only served to compete with bus service it was already providing to South Boston and transit service already being provided to the Airport (Logan Express).Meanwhile, beneficial projects have been pushed back numerous times or haven't even left the drawing board.*The Green Line Extension into Somerville/Medford was supposed to have been COMPLETED in 2008--no wait, 2014--no wait 2019 . . .*The Blue Line Extension to Lynn--still in ""proposal"" phase.*The Red Line-Blue Line Connector--still in ""nice to have"" phase.#3 CUSTOMER SERVICEThe bus and train operators certainly could take a chill pill: not only are they some of the highest paid people in the state without ever needing a college degree, their pay scale is WAY above that for most public transit employees in this COUNTRY--and that's even adjusted for cost-of-living! Add in being  part of the Carmen's Union--arguably one of the most iron-clad organizations since the Teamsters--and it certainly is a recipe for apathy towards the riding public.Part of the problem is that the MBTA relies almost solely on a lottery system (let's be honest, there's always some *hush hush* grandfathering-in--but we won't talk about that!) to hire bus and train operators. Sure, everyone gets a fair shot, but, wouldn't it be nice if SOME of the hiring was done of people who come from similar jobs who left in good standing?Let's say Bus Operator A  worked at Peter Pan/Trailways/Greyhound for ten years and got tired of the long, boring drives: Boston--NYC, Boston--Concord, NH, etc. Bus Operator A leaves with an exemplary record and is just looking for a change of scenery. That bus operator would be great for the MBTA! But, because of the lottery, Bus Operator A is competing with Pond Scum who dropped out of high school and just got his/her GED.  Sure, Pond Scum needs a job too--but, let's be real--there are people who take jobs because they even REMOTELY love what they're doing and there are people who take jobs because the Carmen's Union negotiated RIDICULOUSLY high salaries and generous pension plans for doing the same sit-in-traffic (cry me a river) job done by MILLIONS of people worldwide. You know what you wind up with when the  T hires Pond Scum? You wind up with the bus operator who took out a car trying to run down a ""meter maid"" because of her personal unpaid tickets."
394,1,"Sep 29, 2015",Why can't you fix the escalators and elevators at the Rt 128 Train Station?  The escalator from the north bound track has been out of service - literally for years!  Now the escalator inside the station between the 1st and 3d floor is out of service and has been for months.  Additionally one of the two elevators inside the station is out of order.  In MBTA terms this is a relatively new facility.  It is a disgrace that it is allowed to deteriorate.  Has the agency lost site of its mission - to provide reliable public transportation to the community -  a mission which management and employees should be proud?  Where's the leadership on this?
395,1,"Feb 26, 2011",wish I could rate no stars. I waited over 30 minutes for a bus that should have come twice. I watched them lose over 20 customers while I was standing there(not good business). Every time I take the T I am reminded why I ride a bike. Its never on time and everyone you talk to seems like they would rather stab you than take you 2 minutes down the line. Why pay to stand around and be late?
396,3,"Jun 1, 2011","I have been riding the MBTA my entire life, I wish they do the projects promised with the big dig project, big dig falls apart and we still don't have green to Somerville/medford, green back to JP, blue/red connector, blue to Lynn. Also the T loves buses over subway/streetcars.. there are so many grown over short train routes such as Lynn to Wellington via Saugus. This right of way would make a good bus rapid transit.. not the bus rapid transit on Washington st in South End to Dudley.. if that silver line was on a former train right of way, yes it would be good but not on the street.. insult to those people who once had the elevated train. In the 70's the T was all about orange/red expansion and now since they have taken the train system over from the private companys such as Boston and Maine they rather care about 100 train riders, bring back Bud cars to carry so few people."

There was only 1 clerk at the service desks (5 were empty).Other MBTA personnel started to come in about 20 minutes into may wait and in that time joked around, drank their beverages, cleaned their counters, played with their computers BUT not one of them helped anyone in line. After 30 minutes I had to get back to work. With nothing accomplished.The wait at the old windows (right next to the NEW Charlie Card Store) only took up to 10 minutes EVER in those lines. Unfortunate that the money (yours and mine) that was put into this new store was sorely wasted.Great way to waste money MBTA."

399,1,"Nov 20, 2014","There is often something wrong with the train, there are usually delays of some sort. There is no expectation of any sort of consistent bus/train schedule. The 32 bus from Forest Hills station has been especially vexing. When I get there in the afternoon, there are lots of kids who just got out of school trying to get on the bus. It's always crowded, even if I wait for the next bus. Today, two empty buses passed right by. Others waiting have said they've complained to the MBTA, to no avail. The 32 seriously needs to run more frequently or start using double-decker buses because this is ridiculous. It is a waste of people's time. And in a city like Boston, public transportation is cheaper and is supposed to be more convenient than driving one's own car. The entire public transportation system needs to be more efficient. In addition, it needs to be easier to purchase Charlie cards that work. There are a limited number of retail locations where cards can be purchased.  Charlie tickets are easier to get, but the turnstiles don't read them well--or at all. The machine takes a Charlie ticket in and out several times trying to read it, and sometimes doesn't work even though there is a sufficient balance on it. You need to fix those machines. I could go on about how inefficient everything is, but I'm too tired. -One very dissatisfied customer."
400,3,"Sep 25, 2012","I wouldnt say the MBTA is really ""that"" bad.. instead, i think its okay. As long as i get to the places i need to go to. Although, the MBTA can be dirty at times and sometimes require a really long wait to get into a train, but overall, I think that as long as i get to the places i need to go to then i'm fine. There are air conditioning during the hot summers, which makes it somewhat more enjoyable when taking the mbta. However,  the fare increase lately so i'll think twice before taking the train again. Overall, i think we could use some new trains or at least a renovation here and there."
403,1,"Oct 1, 2014","I am forced to use the system to get to work and everywhere else I need. I have had times in the past where I will be going out to the bus stop (well before the time posted on the rider tool of MBTA website) and it will be driving away... OR I will wait for almost 10 minutes after the posted time until it finally decides to show up. TODAY though, I needed to get my rabbit to the vet, so I used the Ride Planning tool to figure out when I would grab the bus from my stop to get to where I was planning on taking a taxi from. Iit was scheduled to come at 1:16, so I headed out (in the pouring rain, mind you....with my rabbit in her carrier!) at 1:08, which i thought was more than early. I stood out, getting soaked, saw two THE RIDE busses pass me, and by the time it was 1:35, I was very upset. I decided that I would no longer make it on time for my appointment, I had just kept my little rabbit out in the rain and wind for longer than expected, and I ended up having to reschedule my whole appointment! I am not happy with the posted times vs actual pick-up times.... be it too early or too late. I KNOW they can't possibly be exact every time (wheelchair pickups, traffic, whatever) but this was outrageous! If you are going to pick people up ten minutes before the posted time, then change the time online so we know! And if you are going to be more than 20 minutes late to a stop, put out an alert or something! This is not ok."

Just the other night, a driver shut the door in a woman's face and drove away.  This morning, the woman driving the bus sat at a stop for almost three minutes waiting for a passenger to find her wallet while others with passes waited patiently to get on the bus instead of getting everyone on and continuing on the route.

The guy madly yells at me that i need to buy the ticket on board. No other info is provided. i ask him that i heard there is a $3 surcharge for buying on board and also how will the ticket checker know which station i boarded from and he gives me some gibberish which i fail to understand since his tone was very rude.

It's simple, straightforward and had stops everywhere I needed to go. The one day pass for $9.00 was perfect for me to get around wherever I needed to go. I was only in Boston for one day but it was less crowded during rush hour than it was in New York or DC at least. I will admit the trains themselves are complete trash. The screech that emits from the train's brakes sounds like your old math teacher scratching her claws against the chalkboard right next to a microphone with the volume turned all the way up."

If it was privately owned, then it would be much better.  There is an idiotic and jerk conductor who is very rude and very apathetical in the Lowell line.  I asked that jerk conductor to have the 2 stupid guys to keep quiet and he said that it is okay that they talk when it supposed to be a quiet train.  He does not care at all.  I put a complaint against that jerk and idiotic conductor.  I feel that the complaint department will ignore me.  MBTA does not take complaints very serious.

418,3,"Jul 1, 2006","i've done some thinking about this and i finally decided to yelp my true feelings for the mbta. i've become carfree in 2006 (using zipcar, my bike, the T, and my feet to get around) so i've had to take mbta more often than i did before, to places i would've driven to before (i.e. to brighton or to the suburbs like waltham or newton from where i live in somerville). and yes, it totally is a mixed bag. shit is broken half the time, buses don't arrive, you're waiting for the T forever, the bullshit new ""an outbound train is now arriving"" announcement (uhm, try an actually useful system like the MUNI or BART ""a pittsburg/bay point train is arriving in 5 minutes..."" system), fare hikes, etc. BUT the fact of the matter is that i CAN get there from here. for instance, there's a bus that goes from cambridge to brighton so i can get where i need to go. yes, it only runs once an hour on the weekends, but there still is that option. same goes for the 'burbs...i was going to a friend's barbecue in waltham and there was a bus i could take - it didn't run that often but there still WAS a bus. get the picture? if you're willing to have patience and work with the system and allot yourself a LOT of time to get where you need to be, the mbta gets the job done. in some cities there just aren't buses or trains that go from point A to point B and the mbta system is expansive, if not reliable. the T is also randomly awesome sometimes - like when you're walking to the hynes stop and there's randomly a number 1 bus there, which you can take straight down mass ave to harvard square in half the time it would take you to go inbound on the green line and then outbound on the red. or the commuter rail, which you can ride with your subway pass within zone 1a. my boyfriend works in the north end and instead of having to deal with red to green (or orange) crap, he just takes the commuter rail one stop from porter to north station and his commute is cut down from an hour to like 15 minutes. a big beef i have with the system though is the whole bikes on Ts thing. i called the other day to inquire about what buses have bike racks on them since i wanted to bring my bike with me to where i was going, and the woman on the phone had no idea what i was talking about, and had to ask her supervisor..who then told me that the only buses that had racks were crosstown buses and those ""used to have them, like a couple years ago"". uh, hello?? shouldn't you be INCREASING the number of bike racks to reduce the number of cars on the road instead of DECREASING them? also, we desparately need the proposed ""urban ring"" to cut through all of the lines. going inbound just to have to go back outbound is damn stupid. it would cut down on a lot of the congestion on the green line (which is only really bearable during the summers when the college students aren't here)."

420,1,"Sep 29, 2012","They're cracking down on fare evaders, which means it's ok for T employees to be rude to ALL of the passengers again. Service is worse than ever but at least grouchy unionized drivers have a reason to get up in the morning."
421,4,"Apr 11, 2013","I am a fan of the T.  I do not drive and take buses pretty much everywhere. I take the trains on occasion.  I live in South Boston, so, the T from here can get me to another bus to where I may be going.I've only encountered 2 really disrespectful bus drivers in over 45 years.The last time was just a few weeks ago.  I was on Bus #73 from Harvard on Sunday, March 24, between 12 and 1 pm. It was my first time on that bus.  I had no idea that folks tap their Charlie cards upon exiting the bus.  I was the first one on the bus, so, I tapped mine when I got on.  After a few stops outside of Harvard, I noticed that people were just getting on and a few who got off, tapped getting off.  When I first got on, I asked the driver about a certain street just before Belmont and he said ""g'head, just sit down, g'head"".  So, I sat down and when I saw the street coming up, I rang to get off.  When I was getting off, I told the bus driver I didn't know that the passengers tapped their cards getting off, and, I had tapped mine getting on and he said ""Just get off, keep going, get off"".  I was the only passenger at that time.I still cannot get over his rudeness.  I thought maybe it was a bad day for him, but, it was really a bittersweet day for me for where I was headed and I just could not excuse him.  He was a jerk and later on, I remembered seeing him in action on another line where he humiliated a young man until the guy got off of the bus swearing...then, he threatened to call the police.  He antagonized the kid.   It was totally uncalled for.This and, another time are the only times that a bus driver was rude and condescending and sarcastic and surly and disrespectful and unkind for no reason whatsoever only that I didn't know that you paid getting off of the 73 bus."
422,2,"Feb 22, 2015","I heard that the MBTA dosn't treat riders nice with refunds anymore? If they cancel service you don't get to have your money back as a refund, on a bus and subway and the commuter rail and boat, if you buy a pass that's good for all services. That's if you can't use your monthly  commuter rail zone 8 pass do to suspended services for many days, then that's taking money for no reason, that's not right, if they don't refund your money for a cancelled or suspended service for many days, that really hurts and it isn't fair period.If companies think customers should come first that they serve. Then they should give you a refund for like a monthly pass , if you were not able to use the pass for many days due to bad wreather, suspended services, that's the way it should be, a refund is really important. Since the MBTA dosen't give out refunds due to distrupted cancelled services or suspended services for many days, then it's not customers come first period. No refunds anymore is really bad unfair customer service, when transit service is cancelled or suspended for many days, even if you have a monthly pass and can't  use it, that's not right at all, that's not fair period. It's like you paid for cancelled or suspended rides. They don't have to treat customers that way. What happend to? You have the right to be heard, as a customer bill of right's as an apology and to give you a refund or a free ride ticket hello? Seems like customer bill of right's don't serve riders anymore, that's terrible. A customer bill of right's is stll needed ok, thank you MBTA."
423,1,"Jul 16, 2015","I am actually on a failing green line train as I type.lol lmfao Boston. Anyways. I wish I could vote 0. I've lived outside Boston my entire life and over the years...I've seen the quality of all the lines plummet. Whoever manages the T should be fired. Every single one of the executive people. I bet those truly in charge pocket half the budget that is already much too low. No matter how early I leave to get to work...I always end up delayed or late. Its total BS. the green line is a joke. The RED line that is better is still delayed all the time. The Orange line looks like it's from the 50s and runs very inconsistently. They recently spent all this money to ""refurbish"" the green line. For one. None of those ever run on the B. We still get the short end of the stick. But nonetheless. Slapping on some paint and new lights is not going to fix the severe track and electrical malfunctions of this old and decrepit system. The T and Boston transport/road system in general is deteriorating. Just angers me how much we pay in this state and city yet none seems to be going to the transport"
424,1,"Jul 6, 2011","The absolute worst, most lame, ignorant, disorganized, disrespectful, financially irresponsible, poorly managed, over worked, under maintained public transit ""system"" the city of Boston could ever have.  Being one of the most cutting edge, sophisticated, hi-tech cities in the country, you would think that the bus and train system would not only make sense, but also work on a reliable schedule.  But of course not! In classic ""Old Boston""/Blue-blood/""Old-money"" fashion, cronyism and pathetic customer service win out over all.  The so called ""General Manager"", recently promoted Richard Davey is a world-class moron who for a moment impressed me with some personal correspondence about system-wide improvements, but quickly lost any respect after much expected lack of further communication.  I personally have used the ""Write to the Top"" form so many times, gotten SO MANY ""confirmation numbers"", and haven't received ONE follow up as they promise.  I keep reading news articles about how the MBTA is becoming less and less responsible for keeping schedules, maintaining good customer relations and other basic functions that one would come to expect from public transit organizations.  So basically, as time goes on, there will be less penalties for late service, passenger bypasses, breakdowns, out-of-service vehicles and a plethora of other nuisances we'll face without any hope for improvement.  So it's likely while I'm writing this review, that thousands of people are waiting in the blistering heat for a late bus, train, trolley or ride.  the MBTA is so ridiculously terrible at everything it makes me so angry.  Hopefully we here in the Yelp community can speak loud enough to our government and have them step in, kick a$$ and take names.  This pathetic company they call the MBTA needs a serious regime change, and lord knows they ain't gonna do it any time soon on their own.  Come on people! Let's get Richard Davey and the rest of those overpaid a-holes out of their positions and into the ""real world"" so they can see the crap they are were in charge of, and experience all the shoddy service that comes with riding the MBTA.  I'm glad MBTA is on the top 10 worst list, but it should be number ONE not 8!"
