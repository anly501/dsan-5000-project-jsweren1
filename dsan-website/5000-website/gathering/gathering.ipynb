    "The initial piece of data that was gathered comes from the American Public Transportation Association, and can serve as an introductory synopsis of the state of public transit ridership over time. This gives a broad view of quarterly ridership across the entire country from 1990 onward. Thus, this data has been chosen for the potential of setting the stage for the problem which we intend to explore.\n",
