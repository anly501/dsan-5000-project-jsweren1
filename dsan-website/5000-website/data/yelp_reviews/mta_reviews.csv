3,1 star rating,"Aug 23, 2023","This Company is A Literally A Gangsters Mafia , an Organized Group of Criminals with uniforms !!! and I'll explain exactly why I say that . (1) they are stilling people's money , by damaging their metro cards on purpose !!! In the Busses and subway train station machines !! All that is happening from one reason only that people would buy another card , and another one , and if you send your damaged card to them ? they taking the card and say goodbye to your card and to your money !!! For example in the last six months , I buy in the beginning of the month , a monthly unlimited metro card , pay 127$ !!! And already twelve times I purchased the same card again and again , I mean in a six months !!! why ? Because suddenly and surprisingly the card after two weeks or so is damaging !!! So you guys probably asking how come ? And why every card ?? So I'll say /ask the same question to you !! How come every time a different card in a different trains and buses of MTA damaging after two weeks or sometimes after one week ?? And if it's happening to me , who can tell me how many people in NY , it's happening to them also in the same way ?? And I don't play with the card or use it in not appropriate way , like throw it like a garbage in places that would damage the card !! No No !! it comes out of the wallet in the morning , I use it in the bus and the train and it goes back to the wallet !!! No games with the card !! But any it gets damaged !!! And every month after two or three weeks of use !!! I don't get to use it the whole mont !!! And I use it only two times in a day , on my way to work and when I go back home !!! And I buy Monthly unlimited on purpose , because I live in Long Island , and working in Brooklyn !!! So the cost of day by day to pay 11$ cost to much for me , only for the transportation , plus I need food so I don't want to spend that much money in every month so I use / Buy the Monthly card !!! But this company decided I guess to still the peoples money !!! And again , if it's happening to me ? Who promises that it's not happening to thousands of people in NY every Month ?? And every day ?? One hundred percent for sure that it's happening to a lot more people !!! And by that ? they forcing people to buy their "" new  technology  card ""  and pay more and more money , The OMNI card !!! instead of pay one time monthly purchase metro card and use it for a monthly unlimited uses the people have to pay for each ride separately !!! (2) Look in the Subway tunnels , always dirty like a pothole's !!! Full of Homeless people that bother everyone , including tourists !!! And the company making millions and Billions of money !!! where that money goes ?? Look at their representatives !!! How they treating innocent people that come to ask simple questions about how to use this and how to do that , or for directions to somewhere !!! Go by yourself , Go to places like Flushing NY !!! Or Bronx !! Or Brooklyn NY !!! insulting People , and they get out of it without any punishment !!! why ?? Because they are a Big organized  company!!! And they can bring to the courthouses more lawyers !!  And know exactly that you can not allow to yourself to pay !!! And they pay them with the money they stilling from the people !!! the individual citizens can not do anything against them !!! That's why they are the only one company in NY !!! They are the only Monopoly company in NY , and They Have the union that Belongs to them , and fallow the American History , how the Union started to build up in America !!! And the people in NY city don't have any other choice only to use their services , Because ther is no other companies around in the area to use their services with a normal price to go to places from the five boroughs to Manhattan and back !!! and you can not to talk with them even !!! Like Every other Gangster in the world , they will call the police on you !!! And will put you in jail for at least seven years !!!  But they they can talk to you whatever way they want !! To insult you !!! And kick you out of the bus or the train and you can't do nothing at all against them !!! In other words ?? They are A Big Cruel Filthy Mafia !!! Gangsters !!! Nothing else !!! That's what I feel on this MTA Company !!! I wish I had another choice to use other companies cervices in a reasonable prices to go to work and back !! But there is non of them !!!"

5,1 star rating,"Oct 25, 2023","Why should customers pay $2.90 for buses that skip their bus stops? The Q3 bus driver ignored me and skipped the bus stop even though I signaled and he had time to stop there was sufficient space even though repairs are being done at the side of the road. Regardless the bus driver still had the time and space to stop at at 180th street Hillside Avenue. I don't think bus drivers are friendly at all with that attitude. What if an elderly person was waiting for that bus, then what? Please clean up the act, thanks."

Delays, lies on the map, lies on the transit app, app shows bus already when the bus did not even arrive at the bus stop.

21,1 star rating,"Nov 13, 2023","I know this review will fall on deaf ears so consider this speaking my disgust into an empty, deep-pocketed void. I absolutely love when the machines don't work so patrons are forced to jump to avoid missing their trains right where cops are conveniently placed... but all of a sudden they are no where to be found when you have people passing out on the platform from heat exhaustion, sick individuals that threaten to harm an entire subway car during your daily morning commute so you have to resort making a report through a Twitter DM (totally not speaking from experience)... absolutely disgusted at the regression of service since the fare hike. If anything, you should have waited until all of these services were in ship and sharp standing before charging people extra for your seriously embarrassing delays. Pull yourselves together. Forget the visual ascetics and focus on your failing, broken infrastructure."
22,1 star rating,"Nov 25, 2021","Consider this as an over arching review of the nearly three decades I've been alive being born and raised in the city and the possibly 13 to 14 years I've used this system to commute to either school or work. Question: how are you guys getting worse as time goes on? I could care less about the high tech ads or whatever new ad-on that natives don't give two shits about. Yeah, a nifty subway is absolutely welcomed, but could you maybe focus your updates on your trains to be a little more punctual, you know, services people actually care about? I remember going to high school and I could actually predict when a train was going to pull in to my station, as came in around the same time every morning. Now, you'd be lucky if a train even pulled in!Tell me how you guys want to keep raising these prices on fares but then decide to do track work in the middle of a work day and shut down both sides of the tracks so people are stranded every which way. Get your shit together. And stop raising the price on rides. Like everyone has the luxury to pay for this incompetent service.And OMNY is such a ridiculous idea. Like everyone living here has the privilege of smart phones and credit cards. AND considering the city's up in crime since the pandemic, that makes no sense to implement a system to flash those items out in the open in order to hold a ride."

24,1 star rating,"Aug 12, 2022","Current NYC mayor Eric Adams seems to have even less common sense than his pez-headed predecessor Bill de Blasio, if that's even humanly possible. The MTA's scheme to raise $1B in incremental revenue through congestion pricing for automobiles entering Manhattan is fraught with so many unintended consequences that I can only assume that they are in fact, intended and the comedians who run city government just don't care. In a scenario laid out by British newspaper The Daily Mail (London already has a similar plan) a ride into NYC from my home in Princeton will trigger $120 in congestion pricing on top of tolls, gas, parking etc. No sympathy expected, it's just an illustration.That's $200+ just to come to Manhattan in order to work, dine, play, shop etc. I don't care whether I can afford to pay or not, this punitive tax is an automatic non-starter. Under this plan it would literally be cheaper to fly into Dallas to catch a Rangers game than arrive at MSG by car. Of course that example is not perfect but you get my point. Adams is screaming for remote workers to return to their offices full time via mass transit but the Subway (not to mention the streets) remains a crime spree so who's kidding who Mr. Mayor. And as we all know the MTA is a dumping ground for cronyism and political patronage so a profound no thank you to their very porous fiscal oversight.So now you're in Manhattan and an Uber or Lyft will run you an additional $40 on top of their ridiculous dynamic pricing. Do they really want to turn Manhattan over once and for all to the gilded plutocrats for whom no cost is an impediment or imposition. Maybe they do. I have commuted to and worked in Gotham for decades (mostly on public transit) and would have no problem writing off NYC completely with my middle finger waving in the breeze.Do the Apparatchiks in NYC ever stop to consider the countless micro-decisions people make everyday about where to spend their money. If tax revenue falls 10-15 percent because tri-state suburbanites decide to venture in less often -- what happens to the majority of mainstream restaurants and theaters in Manhattan already dealing with depressed patronage. The Met Galas of the world will always be fine, it's the remaining 99.9 percent of commerce that I worry about. It's just insane.My firm belief is that NYC's government is congenitally stupid and so desperate for revenue that I have no doubt whatsoever that some version of this hair brain scheme will be implemented. Goodbye NYC you can see by my finger I think you're number 1.(BTW, if some version of this passes, there's little doubt that congestion pricing will soon be coming to a city near you.)"
25,5 star rating,"Aug 3, 2022","Today I used the MTA Mobile Van Service because my Senior Metro Card stopped working. The card is an online automatically refill because they have my credit card on file. When my trips reduce my account to $10 balance they bill my credit card $25. I can't refill it at the subway. You can call 511 for Metro Card problems and the MTA representative will tell you where the van will be located near you. I also found the full list of locations online at the website. I decided to walk to 78th on York today because the weather was not too warm. At first the line looked intimidating but within 15 minutes I was next to go inside. The employees are all definitely friendly,  professional, and people persons! I gave the one employee a laugh when he asked the problem and I said my Metro Card is broken. Once inside the really nice employee asked for the card and a photo ID. He said he would need to call to verify the balance on my card and then he would have the ability to take possession and give me a temporary Senior Card. He then also filled out a form that was multiple copies with all my information. I received one as my receipt. Then he said if I had cash I would be able to put money onto my temporary card right there or I could wait and go to the subway to put money on it. I took advantage of giving him enough money for Five Trips. The temporary card is good until September 30, 2022. He assured me my new card would come by then. If not I have to get another temporary card. He also advised me when I get the new card to use up the balance on the temporary first. When they put your cash on the card they show you the balance on it using their scanner. I'm so glad they have this service. The van is at the 92 Street Y the first Thursday each month 10-12. If tomorrow wasn't going to be so hot I would use that location. If I have problems in the future I'll know what to do now. They really made me feel like a valued customer and they have the drill down so it's as smooth as a babies butt. I'm recommending!"
26,5 star rating,"Sep 4, 2019","I cannot think of a better review for my NUMBER 1300 than the MTA. Everyone can complain all you want. Look at the numbers people! Look at the number of buses and trains that operate daily on a 24 hour Seven day 365 day basis. Look at the number of riders. Look at the great improvement like the Second Avenue Q Train. I survived the construction! The employees are neat and clean in their uniforms. I spoke to two this morning. They are on the job in shifts. Five in the morning to 1pm and around the clock. They are friendly and responsive when you are in need. I know some subway stations are old and dirty. I see the homeless. What do you expect with over 8.5 million people in the city? I'm paying a lot of tax. Yes there are things that I feel my money is wasted on. I can definitely say MTA is not one of them. Come visit my city. Ride the bus and train. Enjoy the sights. Breathe in the fine NYC Air (hahaha). When you do, please remember the vast number of hard working employees that are making all of this possible on a daily basis. Tell them 'Thanks' if you have the opportunity. They really do appreciate hearing it from YOU!"

The station displays were not working and the booth operator did not provide us with any information/updates on the situation. It was FREEZING that day so I ended up driving to work rather than continue to wait in the station.Now the MTA is denying my transit delay application with the response ""We have researched your request. Our records indicate that the trip you took did not experience a delay as you described."" Really!?! What kind of research did you do?! I want to know, because you came to the wrong results.The 7:02 AM train DID NOT COME!!!"

It's been around for a long time and in some regards - okay in many regards - it looks like it's been around for a long time. Some of the employees aren't friendly, and some of them are better. It services soooo many people from so many places in so many neighbourhoods, and it's pretty impressive. The network is pretty vast and endless.

Driving between boroughs on work days is out of the question because traffic in the  busiest city in the country is ridiculous.  So you're stuck with few options other than with this uncomfortable mode of transportation if you do decide to move here.  GOOD LUCK!!"

46,1 star rating,"Sep 26, 2021","Can't think of anything good to say about the MTA. The subways are slow, unreliable, and sometimes dirty. Possibly also unsafe if you believe media reports. The subway costs twice as much to operate as similar systems in Europe and even some parts of the US. Multiple investigations (by the New York Times, Bloomberg, and the former governor) have shown that overtime fraud is rampant. MTA workers claim overtime pay and leave work early. Even if you don't use mass transit, you're probably paying the MTA hundreds of dollars a year in the form of at least four different taxes."

The sites and map apps are the worst they never tell you when the bus will come. And if they do it'll tell you it's coming in 10,7,5,2,1 and then it'll say it's departing now. And the whole time your standing there like a penis while the bus never comes. Or sometimes it'll say the bus is 7 minutes away so your standing at the bus stop like a hooker waiting to get picked up expecting it to actually come in 7 min because the cocksucking site says it will then it never shows up. very unreliable, this is what the prices are going up for? For us to be willing to pay and you not being able to hire enough drivers to drive the bus when it's there only job? Hire more people then.

The busses are even worse because you have to wait for them   forever. One day I was waiting for the bus for 40 minutes and I thought that it will never come. This nightmare has to stop because I have no patience waiting for subway trains and busses all day long. There is also a big problem with 511 representatives because they are giving me the wrong directions on purpose. I don't call them anymore because I don't want to waste my precious time on these liars.

It is getting expensive but still less than a taxi. Don't even think about getting on one of the awful busses. I only gave it a second star because it is quick (most of the time) and less costly than other modes of transport in the city. Fogettabout it on weekends when services are rerouted and disrupted. You have no idea whee you are going and how to get there since no one works in the boots anymore. An antiquated system for use by way too many people it has no future but to get worse"

Turns out they do not offer a replacement, only a refund. Not only that, the refund is a check or a credit on the card you used to purchase. The gentleman at the registration gets your info and sorts people out before grabbing a ticket. Decent guy but a bit rude. The guy at the customer service desk was even more curt and wasnt really trying to help me. Once I explained I was from out of town he offered the credit charge back. That's should've been offered as an option from the getgo.Overall, it was quick (less than 30) and efficient. I'll take that, especially for a govt agency."

65,2 star rating,"Jan 21, 2020","Crap. It's nice being able to not drive but this can be frustrating. The MTA is the local subway  system in NYC. Not all of it is bad. Of course, much more of it sucks like shit.  First the good. It has a way to get unlimited rides. There's weekly and monthly passes that you can use countless times. Bad things now. The passes are made of a tough paper, which if you're not careful enough, can get ruined. In DC they have plastic cards. Why not here? If you're extra careful like me you'll put the cards where they can't get bent. This doesn't always prevent problems. Sometimes the cards just won't work for no reason at all. That's enough about the cards. A lot more is bad. The thing getting the most complaints is the poor service. If you're paying for this system through not just your card purchases but also through your paychecks, it should give you reliable service as in trains not being delayed and other annoyances. Trains routinely have many problems.  How about fixing that air conditioning or heat. The booth workers also seem to have surliness as part of their job requirements. Many stations are really fucking gross. Walls are covered in black mold or piss stains. It still is the best transportation available. Much better than paying for outrageous cab fare. That's not saying much for the subway though."

68,1 star rating,"Jan 6, 2020","Ah, MTA - you take one of the world's greatest cities and make transport so bad that it wouldn't even be fit for purpose in the smallest of UK town's.The MTA really makes me grateful for the transportation systems we have in the UK even if they can be pretty shoddy in their own rights, it makes Northern Rail look like the Hogwarts Express for goodness sake.The subway might be one of the fastest ways to get around town, but I really don't understand - Why do they have different numbered routes and different colours with no obvious signs to which goes where- Why are stations so dirty and smelly?- Why are staff at stations generally rude?- Why can't you pay with contactless with a similar system to London's Oyster Card? When travelling in the Big Apple you pay one fee regardless of going one stop or several, this is compared to London's zonal system where you can travel in central London zones 1 and 2 for £7 per day (even international tourists), this means you can hop on and off all day on buses, trams or the tube, meanwhile MTA just charges you per journey.- Why is disabled access so poor? There is only one gate at most stations for prams/wheelchairs which requires a special disabled MTA ticket otherwise you could be stranded trying to get in/out which makes no sense.I also noticed the buses seemed so old too, spraying harmful smoke everywhere and the overcrowded, dirty, old subway trains weren't much better either.The transit system of NYC and the only way to get across the city and all of its' boroughs (buses, subway) is just so shockingly poor. I'm not sure how the system works in the states, but if Transport for London operated to such standards they'd be mass riots and something would be done and I think it's just unacceptable how they've been able to carry on with sub-par services while still charging high costs to get around.1*"

72,3 star rating,"May 1, 2018","It is $2.75 for a single ride on the NY MTA subway system, but a 5% bonus is added when you buy or add $5.50 or more to your MetroCard.I calculated that I would need to take 13 rides to benefit financially from the unlimited pass, but for convenience's sake, I purchased a 7 day unlimited ride metro card for $32 plus the dollar charge for a new card on my recent weekend to this city.  The only other unlimited ride option is 30 day for $121.I ended up having taken 11 trips over my 3 day 2 night trip by the time I headed back to Boston, but I had a great time!I was confused by their subway system since the T system at home was so much simpler, but just a few tips I picked up along the way:Uptown is NorthDowntown is SouthStreets are short blocksAvenues are long blocksNumbered streets go up as you head northNumbered avenues go up as you head westWhite Dots for ExpressBlack Dots for Local stopsDownload the Free New York Subway Locator app (the black icon with the white S) for an offline map option.Watch out for service changes due to track maintenance, particularly on the weekend.  Check it out on http://www.mta.info/On the Google Map app, be sure to select the Transit map detail option to help identify the lines available at each station.  Also, the map seems better able to locate you when an offline map has been downloaded.  I'll have to download a NYC map my next visit to test out this theory."

74,5 star rating,"Nov 11, 2019","Yes, that is right, I am writing a review for the best subway system in the United States bar none. In fact, that goes for the entire transit network, the LIRR, Metro North, the whole kit and caboodle. But this review will focus more on the subway. The New York City Subway is one of it's kind, with 469 subway stations and vast lines formerly owned by several companies before the MTA bought them all and now own and operate the subway as it's own. And they do a damn good job at maintaining it despite it's flaws. Is it perfect? No. Far from it. But for a system that is 115 years old, I would say that this is the system to mimic for all it is worth. It stops EVERYWHERE. It is CHEAP. It is THE BEST DEAL IN THE CITY. Trains are fast, frequent, and always available. It is a 24/7 system after all!And the system is always looking to modernize. Yes the system sometimes shows it's age, but at the same time it is always looking ahead towards the future. Automating lines, improving the stations, making safer walkways, there is always something to be done here. The New York City Subway is the reason I love trains. I mean once you start riding it maybe you can understand why I feel so strongly about this network of trains running above and below ground. It just feels so right to ride it everywhere. Complain all you want about the delays during rush hour and weekend maintenance, but somebody's got to be inconvenienced if you want it to continue to run at a high level. That is a small price to pay. Speaking of small prices, you just cannot find any other deal like this one in New York, and it pays off, big time."
75,5 star rating,"Apr 22, 2019","State of the motha effin' art! For REAL! This transit system is world renowned and there's a perfectly good reason as to why; because it's effective and will get you to practically ANY borough of New York during any and all hours of the day and night. It's crazy to think that the rating is only an average of 2 stars. But then again, I don't live here. I don't know all of the ""issues"" that may be associated with this transit system. However, what I DO know is that it saved me so much money and time while visiting New York. Before I hopped on an NY subway for the first time, I could never understand why so many New Yorkers didn't know how to drive. I mean... you can ""try"" to do this in Cali, but good luck. It's hard trying to get around here on public transportation, let alone in and around the far East Bay Area and beyond. And like NY, ridesharing and taxicabs are just too expensive to be taking every day. Once I hopped amidst that mystical subway train, I knew that I would probably never rent a car or take a taxicab in NY ever again. NOW I understand why all of you New Yorkers don't know how to drive! Because you don't have to!!! The MTA goes every damn where! I am so jealous that we aren't this advanced in California. To honest, our transit system is laughable when even compared to the buses in NY! So ridiculous, but so true. It's hard to believe that this train station is over 100 years old and is still in working condition, transporting millions of people throughout New York each year! I'm sure some things can be spruced up of course, but generally speaking, this transit system is amazing. For one thing, the majority of the subway stations are located underground. Nowadays, that's not really ideal I guess. But it's just amazing how fast you can get from one end of NY to the other on the subway. Tons of people take the trains at all hours of the day and night, so if you're going solo, you won't feel alone. The stops are never too far apart from each other. NY's transit system uses a ""Metrocard"" which is good for all public transportation within the state including the NYC transits subways, local and express bus lines, Staten Island Railway, the Airtran to JFK, and a few other transit partners. The cost per ride is around $3 and you can refill your card at any Station Booth or Metrocard vending machine. They also have a 7 day and 30 day unlimited ride passes available. I purchased a 7 day unlimited ride pass for around $30 and it was really a great deal. I've spoken with a few locals in the area who have told me that the prices for the train are expensive. But to be honest, these prices are WAAAAY cheaper than our Bart train in the Bay Area! I could easily spend $10 a day getting to work and back, and that's just a short distance compared to other people who have to travel much further. I would GLADLY pay for their unlimited passes to get around NY if I lived there. Since the trains are underground, phone reception can be pretty non-existent. The train stations aren't the cleanest but I've seen a lot worse where I live. If you're carrying large luggage, good luck trying to get it through the tiny little entryway! I struggled trying to get my luggage through, and it was only a carry-on bag... okay fine, it was overstuffed... but STILL! I wish they had a least one wider entrance for large bags. Oh yeah... and all of those stories about huge NY rats at the train stations... yep, it's true. I saw the biggest rat of my entire LIFE just moseying along the waiting area at one of the stations. While I was practically dying, everyone else just went about their business and the rat ran clear across the platform. I ran to the other side. This Cali girl was NOT about to be getting attacked by a damn cat sized rat! Aside from those nuances, I truly envy NYC's transit system. I hope that one day California's transit system will advance the way that NY's has. But until then, I'm stuck with this sh*t that we call a train! NY, you need to be more appreciative of the MTA! It's a wonderful perk to have."

80,4 star rating,"Nov 24, 2018","I think my bf and I were incredibly lucky the weekend we used the MTA in NYC. After trying to use an Uber or two -- they were expensive AF, just not ideal for a quick ride (the wait was sometimes 8+ mins), and NYC tends to be  busy - the ride alone takes a long time. Remember: train stations are everywhere in NYC. Download the CityMapper app on your phone. It tells you live updates on the trains & which station to go into. Super easy. I'm directionally challenged and I was able to figure it out! We got the unlimited 7 day pass for like 30 bucks each? Around there, it wasn't outrageous. Note: we were constantly going somewhere. The unlimited pass came in handy and it saved us $$$ ride-wise (again Uber is expensive AF in NYC!). And I think 7 days is the minimum for the ""unlimited"" pass. They have more days available but we were only staying in NYC for like 4 days. As for the trains - most of them came on time (perhaps like 90%). The other 10% of the time, the trains were delayed maybe 5 mins. I heard other NYC-ers tell me that trains are sometimes very delayed. Perhaps if you're lucky, you'll see a celeb riding a train with you as well."

88,3 star rating,"Oct 3, 2015","Oh... the MTA subway system..In my 20+ years in this city.. A couple of positives. LONG list of negatives. Some interesting experiences. Some interesting people.First of all, I agree with reviewer Tina C., in that ""New York City has the MOST efficiently covered citywide system. It is truly the ONLY one system in the whole world that operates 24/7 @ 365 days a year."" Now I can't speak for other major cities, but I can speak for my home city of Shanghai. Ok, last time I was back in Shanghai was 2011..and even then, the subways in Shanghai..however technologically advanced they were compared to NYC, however clean and well maintained they were compared to the dump that is MTA's subways.. The subways in Shanghai DO NOT run 24/7. So just on that point alone..NYC's subways has the win! But damn..back to the maintenance issue. Many of NYC's subway stations are so filthy! The stations themselves are dirty.. the tracks have so much garbage..frequently starting track fires that cause delays in the commute. Lots of homeless people congregate in the subways too. From my experiences in taking the E and F trains, I've seen homeless people hog an entire corner in the a subway car, sleeping on the seats and having bags of their belongings strewn about in front of them. Navigating the subway system is more efficient and easier in recent years. Most major stations have wireless connectivity. And there are many mobile apps you can download like Embark NYC and Exit Strategy, that can give you up-to-date information on Subway times, delays, etc.Taking the NYC subway system as a primary transportation every day..you can see people from all walks of life..and many people may say, that is the ""beauty"" of NYC; it's such a huge melting pot of different cultures. And that's true.. You can see some interesting people in the subways..loll Although, I know many people who say it is because of so many ""weirdos"" in the subways, that they refuse to take the subways and prefer to drive to the city or take the LIRR. So it is honestly a love/hate relationship..loll"

91,1 star rating,"Sep 21, 2016","The Easy Pay Xpress metro card is a huge joke-- DO NOT GET IT Not only do you need to call their support service line, which means spending 45 minutes on hold during a week day, to cancel your service should you massively regret signing up, they do not send you a different Metro card that you can begin using, since the EasyPay card cannot be reloaded using their regular machines apparently. Their website looks like it's from 1995 and is impossible to understand. They also do not refund your balance back to your credit card for 10-12 business days even though your card is immediately canceled. Oh and the best part is after waiting those 45 wonderful minutes on hold, you will likely find the tellers' explanations of why you've been incorrectly charged a variety of different amounts to vary person to person, and you are only met with sour attitudes when you ask for clarification. Not like being out $150 for two weeks is frustrating enough. Gotta love MTA....."

Most other American cities only have buses or ""light-rail"" trains that have to share the road with other traffic. New York City still has the best transit system in the country despite the service problems. That's why you don't need a car here.2. Cheaper than Uber.CONS:1. Service delays due to train traffic2. Metrocard doesn't work if you just used it like if you entered the wrong side and had to exit and re-enter on the other side. They need to remove the 18 minute time restriction. Also sometimes the Metrocard reader does not work because the machine can't read your card.3. Equipment breakdowns... (Trains, track signals etc.) if the train breaks down in service, it creates a massive bottle-neck and you can be stuck for a long time. This is a serious problem that needs urgent attention. Somebody has to pay for the maintenance and upkeep of this system. If the private sector isn't paying, then a tax increase may be necessary. I don't think anybody wants another fare hike..."

It is truly the ONLY one system in the whole world that operates 24/7 @ 365 days a year, in the ""City that Never Sleeps.""The system is over 150 years old yet so vastly complicated of gargantuan size that is impossible to upgrade and maintain for outdated equipment; dilapidated stations; dilapidated signal switch problems, inefficient on-time service among other major problems.  Just follow the sound of unwarranted hostility with service issues as nearly every New Yorker will devour how the fare continues hiking to infinity, in conjunction, with ill service performance are a rapid tale spin grave decline.  Panhandlers everywhere and their strong stench airing the trains, ""trains are delayed due to congestion ahead"", ""emergency brake is activated, train crew is investigating the scene"", ""police activity"", or the annoying ""signal problem"", plaguing delays, and the infamous ""this train is out of service, no passengers!!""  MTA is a commuter apocalypse brewing a perfect storm of subway repairs, construction, and commuter rail travel woes that worsens gridlock congestion is creating a commuter's worse nightmare."
102,4 star rating,"Apr 12, 2015","Inter-crossing from Brooklyn to Queens? Or continuing into Manhattan?Hoyt-Schermerhorn Street Station has four island platforms/ cross-platform interchange with six tracks (only 2 in passenger service) which the remaining two are abandoned, no longer used in revenue service.  The two abandon island platforms are, occasionally, used for filming such as 1978 ""The Wiz"".  Nearby is the defunct Court Street station which currently serves as the New York Transit Museum.Due to its width of the station's large mezzanine, inside Hoyt-Schermerhorn Street Station, is a NY Transit Police Station and several NYC Transit Authority offices, and a 24 hour a token booth attendant, ergo strap hangers feel safe.  Few pan handlers exist here, no street busks, and no loud religious preachings.  A, C and G trains are accessible here."

That said, for the weekend a friend and I spent in Manhattan, staying near the Theater District and wanting to see the usual tourist sites like the Statue of Liberty, 9/11 Memorial, Chinatown, Columbus Circle, etc. the subway system was perfect for us. It was fairly easy to navigate, it was reliable on that particular weekend, and the cost was reasonable as well.   To boot, we were able to map our route via Google Maps and understand which line to use, where stations were located and how best to get to and from everywhere we wanted to visit."
104,1 star rating,"Jun 5, 2017","All you need to know about this organization is that the top ""braintrust"" make $200,000 plus per year, they spend billions on shiny new stations, yet don't have the intelligence to invest in signal systems that are 100 years old, therefore trains are always delayed. S Stations and train cars are dirty and reek of urine. The fares cover half the cost so every business in the state within 100 miles has to pay a tax to subsidize this nonsense.

Especially the MTA is running on some third class standards in this supposedly 'world class city'.I have to warn anyone on a vacation that the city smells like pee, and the subways smell worse than that.Never have I ever come across a station that doesn't smell or is rotting, even the newly renovated ones have managed to look like catacombs.People say it is 150 year old so not to expect anything spic and span but they had 150 years to atleast learn to do the bare minimum, like make the trains and the buses run on time, have some hygiene, courteous employees, make ticketing more efficient, train traveling more safe, accessible for all. I am sure they had strollers and disabled population 150 years ago when this shitty concept was conceived, or do the old white men never cared for that part of the population? If God forbid I have to take the elevator, I have to hold my breath.This is by far the worst subway system of all, learn from London, Paris, San Francisco, Singapore.For $2.75?I don't even want to get started on the buses."

GOD FORBID it gets lost or stolen (or both, like in my case), it is impossible to reach someone because apparently, there is ONE single person named Erica who handles any issue you may have.  The phone rings endlessly when you call (877) 323-RIDE and the website was down for 3 days. When someone finally does answer, it's Erica. Well what if she's busy? What if she's on vacation? What if Erica dies? How does a company that keeps charging more & more offer sh*ttier and sh*ttier service???  Get with the times! And the website is like something you'd access when the internet was first invented. May as well use a Commodore 64.  So stupid. They claim to have cancelled my lost card and mailed a replacement but 4 weeks later I've still never received a new one so I just cancelled my Easy Pay account all together. Now I have to monitor my credit card to see if I get the remaining balance returned. Not worth the hassle. Metro cards are bound to get lost or damaged, may as well just buy & refill at the kiosks.  At least those things still work."

Yes, the buses aren't bad other than at rush hours.And the BusTime app is great - why can't they do that with every subway line? It shouldn't be hard to put in a few sensors showing where the train was *last* (forget about between station times)."

At least the rats are enjoying the heat.This is one of the Lexington Avenue #6 line stops I take to work occasionally, or the 28th street station, depending on where I want to grab breakfast before walking into the office. Basic subway station as with most. Not a horrible station as it's fairly clean. No access to the opposite side tracks below ground so you have to cross over Park Ave if you enter the wrong side. No express service - just the local #6. One stop up is Grand Central where you can transfer to multiple train lines.Eh, it is what it is. Understaffed. Announcements suck. MTA ride cost gouging. Yet, it's still the easiest and quickest way to get around the whole city. Cheaper than a cab ride too. Unless they are doing trackwork for the zillionth time! Or there are signal problems!

You can sleep on train while heading home without dealing with noisy riders.The train are clean (shocked)Cons:I hate when they do repair work, so it forces me to take an alternative routeDuring the summer, they tend not to follow their schedule, eg they leave 1-2 mins early. Tip:I do not know why I posting this tip here, because I do not want the world to know all my tricks. Oh well, I drive so it is ok. If you heading downtown, from Union Square, head Uptown 2 stops and get you will always find available seats. Trust me on this one, because people are fighting for seats on 14th Street.

Trains weren't breaking down as frequently and the stench in MTA has not changed; still smells like piss everywhere I go. Same, if not, a declining service but they have no qualms about increasing fares. Once one fare increase passes, they're already vying for the next fare increase. It's not about managing a debt, it's about a quick fix to the detriment of riders. deja vu. Can't do nothing but move out of NYC."
121,1 star rating,"Aug 28, 2014","So I can write a review for the MTA, that's great because I am so displeased with their service. I have lived in NYC all my life and know the supposed ""progression"" in service that has occurred all these years and lemme tell y'all, it's limited. Almost at the end of every budget year they scramble for more money and their scrambling is coming up to the citizens of NYC and telling them to cough it up by paying extra for fares. That's crazy. This is in addition to the tax dollars we pay. Where is MTA's money going? In my opinion, I think it goes to pay for unchecked overtime that workers do but who supervises these overtimes, then there's pension and then there is MTA's debt. Why should the citizens of NYC pay for their mistake in mismanaging their money and suffer bad service? I don't need more signs to tell me where my train is or wifi in the train stations, those are added bonuses. Your main objective is provide me and everyone else service to get from point A to point B which means your concentration should be on creating better train service not a better train experience. That's secondary. Get your priorities straight MTA!"
122,4 star rating,"Apr 22, 2012","This is the 33rd street local station on the 6 IRT subway line; it's one of the original 28 stations in the system. http://forgotten-ny.com/2006/01/the-original-28-part-1-a-look-at-the-artwork-from-the-nycs-first-28-stations-opened-october-27-1904-2/ There is no transfer and no express; there is an alternate entrance/exit at 32nd street in addition to the one at 33rd. It's been remarkably well-kept, with the original glass tiles and natural woodwork. The neatest thing in the station is the public, functional art: graceful cast-bronze rails that wrap around pillars in the station and make surprisingly comfortable seats. (Plus, your butt helps keep them polished.) The piece is called ""Lariat Seat Loops"" and was done in 1997 by James Garvey. (I noticed today they've also got some of these seats in the Wall Street station of the 4 and 5 trains as well.)"
123,4 star rating,"Feb 27, 2012","Oh, how I love this station...oh, I love how the name comes trippingly to the tongue. Only in Brooklyn do you have melodious names like ""Hoyt-Schermerhorn."" [sarcasm]This subway station is truly a ""piece a woik,"" as they say. If you read my other reviews, you know I really do love the gum-stained concrete platforms and white tile walls with yellow railings on the staircases. I have no idea when the station is scheduled to be renovated, although the Jay street station one stop up on the A/C line has just been completed.This is a sprawling station that includes both the A and G (Brooklyn-Queens crosstown) lines; there are plenty of inactive platforms, and still it's a pretty efficient station. The G parallels the A here giving you an easy transfer. (The G itself is a whole 'nother story; that train is a sorry piece a woik.)From SubwayNut's guide to stations: http://subwaynut.com/ind/hoyt_schermerhorna/index.php""Hoyt-Schermerhorn Streets is a very unusual IND express station and across platform transfer point between Fulton Street Line A,C trains and Crosstown Line G trains. The station has four island platforms and six tracks in total, with only the central four tracks and two island platforms are currently in use. The outer two island platforms (The A,C trains platform at both tracks) and wall tracks are permanently closed and only saw about ten years of service for the Court Street shuttle, to that IND station that is now the transit museum. The tracks do see service at times for movie shoots and the station name tiling beneath the wall trim has been known to be for other stations from time to time courtesy of this. The station's former large full mezzanine have been cut apart in a completely ridiculous manor, now with a NYPD transit police station and other non-public areas. There are two staircases up from each platform to a small mezzanine towards the middle of the platform to where the station's only fare control area is, after fare control narrow passageways lead in either direction along one side of the former full length mezzanine to a single staircase at each end up to street level to exits along the north side of Schmerhorn Street near either Hoyt Street or Bond Street. Unusually, each of these exits is set at street level within buildings."""

A city below a city.  Quick pace for the knowledgeable users.  Once I started using an app on my cell phone all fell into place and I got it. Pretty amazing a 7 minute ride can save you 40 minutes of walking time.  Cheaper than a taxi and you don't have to sit in traffic.  Lots of characters down below and normal travelers.  Always something to see and it doesn't have to be Halloween to see it.  Just remember to wash your hands after traveling!
128,1 star rating,"Jul 14, 2015","INEFFICIENT SERVICE. I have traveled to Paris, London, Moscow and all have highly superior subway systems. The MTA has frequent delays. The tracks are covered in trash at a lot of stations, I think the people working for the MTA are purposely delaying trains. Something is very wrong with this system. Why do they not power wash the beautiful remaining Mosaics? They don't wash them so that they can create jobs tearing them down and putting up new ones with ugly bathroom style tiles and take several months to finish the job (as usual).THE MTA is beyond bad. Here is a blatant example of typical behavior from the system administrators (excuse the confusing language but this exemplifies it)""LADIES & GENTLEMAN THE TRAIN ACROSS THE PLATFORM WILL BE MOVING FIRST"" (the herds scurry across the platform, fear stricken, some panicking, some angry and agitated, many tired) MTA: ""LADIES AND GENTLEMAN THIS TRAIN IS NOW OUT OF SERVICE YOU MUST NOW MOVE ACROSS THE PLATFORM TO THE NEXT TRAIN"" (The doors remain shut, it's cold windy and rainy outside, people are visibly upset, meanwhile subway doors are shut and won't let anyone in the cars) People sit. ""DO NOT BLOCK THE DOORS (Roars the loudspeaker) YOU ARE DELAYING THE TRAINS (Notice how they avert to blaming the MTA customers for the delay and scolding them like little children) The train sits there for 15 minutes and finally moves. This could be an excellent system if it had an overhaul and changed it completely. For now it will continue to be a piece of sh*t. I don't think this is what the builders of the system intended."

And the new measures to make stations with electronic wait times and announcements along with the new internet hot spots (even if bandwidth is still an issue) help make me feel the rate hikes are actually doing something more than paying for some rather high blue collar (no offense meant by that term) salaries.  The buses, though.....meh.  I know they can only stick to their schedule due to traffic but so much....but I've had to wait, and had friends have to wait, for buses which never come....or decide they're not doing the last run of the night...and the only way to find this out is to call some magic number, which isn't easily found through public means, to see if the driver called off.

The MTA is a joke of an organization who's execs makeMillions and continue to raise prices and continue to lower quality. Don't even get me started on MTA booth workers. They hate their lives and people who actually make them do their job. God forbid you ask them for directions or to combine the money on your metro card. They should just replace them all with a machine at least the machine has manners an etiquette although that's programmed into it. The rats in the station have more social skills then the employees.

They established totally illegal courts to ""sue"" their livestock cargo (humans) who had their UNLIMITED metrocard in their pockets but entered without using it because otherwise they would miss their lousy trains (trying to squeeze against exiting traffic). I'm talking about a train, which was already 30 minutes late. They managed to employ CITY POLICE which are paid by TAXPAYER'S MONEY to enforce their PRIVATE CORPORATE fake ""laws"".They intentionally cause up to 2 hours train delays just to enjoy seeing their cargo suffering, losing money off work and canceling 2 months long waited doctor appointments. They do it just because they can. They are proud of ruining people's lives. They lobbied most politicians in NY to do what they say.Their conductors play ""I gotcha!"" game, pinching their cargo with closing doors and ohh..... they enjoy doing that, especially if it's a 99 years old grammy!!! I bet they compete amongst each other on who got the highest number of livestock pinched that way at the end of their shifts. And, like classic tyrants, they had the audacity to enact another illegal ""law"" toprosecute any head of livestock cargo (customers) who dares to open his mouth for complaining to such a noble ""His Majesty Conductor"" for being pinched with closing doors repeatedly for several times, after they waited their standard 1 hour for the damn train. And to intimidate they cargo even more, they even put those stickers that say ""7 YEARS IN PRISON!"" for complaining against anything. You can observe these stickers in every subway car.They intentionally created a system where there's no responsible person for anything. This is done so that they can get away with any crime and violation of human rights they can possibly come up with.Their employees are severely overpaid. Anyone can observe up to 20 of them sitting on the tracks or stations, drinking soda, laughing and having good time for 4-6 hours straight, during the time they were supposed to fix the tracks. They especially like doing that on weekends and nights so that their leisure time would be paid x 1.5 for weekends plus another x 1.5 for nights.Did I mention the brown sludge that pours on heads of their cargo in the 150 years-old catacombs they call ""subway stations""? They had 150 years to fix that but won't do it because then how will they enjoy seeing their cargo obliterated?MTA is the single most criminal, most anti-human, anti-american and most suppressive organization in NYC."

Dirty trains and platforms, delays, signal outages, power failure, unfriendly employees, disappeared money....I am just wondering how much progress will be made if I give the subway to monkeys instead of so called ""MTA employees"" to operate?Have you heard a subway system change its route every week??Have you seen a heaven of rats just feet under ground????Have you experienced a train horns the passengers to deaf when it entering the station???Have you seen a modern subway without automatically voice reminder?Have you .....Gosh!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Among all the world, London system is older than New York's, Tokyo rail systems running as twice as entire New York population everyday. Why don't you learn something from them? Every month, millions of NYC commuters pay 112$ for a large pile of shit. AND THEY ARE PLANNING A FARE HIKE!!!!!"

Every other times its either late, shut down for ""repairs"" (i question whatever repairs they do because the service never seems to get better), or over crowded because they don't run enough trains in a logial amount of time.I bet hell is more comfortable that riding an MTA subway."

My visit was rather painless, although I frown upon the need to deal with a situation like this using pen and paper.  The clerk who assisted me with this issue quoted a turnaround time of several weeks, though I noticed the refund in my account about 10 days after my visitIn my case, I got refunded for slightly more than 80% of the damaged monthly metro card that I took in: $93.50 / $112.Note that the refund amount is calculated using the length between A.) the day your metro is either taken in or mailed and B.) the expiration date of the damaged metro card."

146,3 star rating,"Dec 27, 2014","Always a part of the NYC experience, you have to try it in Manhattan although you can still walk most places if you really have to.  Pluses compared to Chicago (my home town): much bigger train carriages, wider seats, more stops in more areas, .  Negatives: dirtier, too many annoying performers, maze-like labyrinths (that are actually sometimes fun when tipsy, you just walk and walk and there are hidden little artistic touches at most stops), often too hard to figure out which is express and which is not (the sound speakers are horribly garbled, a real shame), and too hard to figure out limitations for weekends and after hours for casual users.  Once you get the basics down it is somewhat satisfying but get ready to make mistakes as you enter the beast.  Horribly overheated in the summer!"
147,1 star rating,"Mar 12, 2019","Honestly, taking the subway was the WORST part of our trip. We decided to rent an Airbnb close to Harlem (to save on an expensive Manhattan hotel), so we relied on the subway to go to any tourist attraction.  Considering this is a world class city, the subway is an extreme disappointment.Heads up:- Expect delays (during the day, but especially at night). - The M.T.A. can cancel a part of the line unexpectedly, for the whole weekend. Their app won't help as they are slow to update. Download a PDF of the subway map to find an alternative route. - They can also end the train schedule earlier at their own discretion...""from 9 pm to 11 pm."" It was quite unpredictable what time exactly the last train would run. Again, the app/website was not updating as quick as their changes. Always plan an alternate route!! - Some ticket  booth operators are lazy, they will not help you to purchase the exact amount of trips, even if you know how much you want to put in. Plan and do your research! If you know you need 20 trips, pay for exactly 20 trips on your metrocard. If they say only to put $10, and you know you'll be staying for more than 2 days, you're saving them time on your dime. For exactly 20 trips on the pay-per-ride metrocard, I knew to put $52.40 so I would get a 0 balance (technically $0.02) at the end of my trip. I guess they hate counting change, because they insisted on only putting in $20 and just keep adding ""whatever."" - The speakers are crap. Download a .pdf map on your phone, so you feel you know where you're going. - There is Internet! BUT it only works in stations. So when you're actually travelling on the train, you lose connection. What is the point of that? - The subway is really dirty. You do see rats on the tracks. Certain areas can smell like a combination of hot garbage and urine. - There are a lot of panhandlers and drug addicts on the subway.Pros: - It's the cheapest mode of transportation in New York"

You can get into Manhattan during rush hour much faster from just about anywhere.There are times where you experience the most random shit that will make you laugh because it's so ridiculous. Cons: So fuckin many cons it's ridiculous! I will most likely not be able to list them all or come back and add. I've literally come into work saying ""I hate the fuckin MTA"" more times than I can count"". Listen, I get in order to fix the subways they need to shut down certain lines and most likely will be during the weekend, but SHIT I see so many MTA workers not doing  a damn thing (this goes across the board of all types of workers). They raise the damn fare it seems like every 2 years yet where are the improvements? WHERE???? Then, like many others have stated, many of them have the worst attitudes. Only thing I can say is the damn signs telling you how long til your train comes(which I do appreciate) and the damn 34th street Hudson yards station that was added. Btw, that station is the cleanest/nicest station I've ever been in, too fuckin bad not that many ppl commute to that stop. Yeah, yeah I know it's ""up and coming"" area...blah fuckin blah. Stations are still dirty as hell, random homeless ppl will stink like PURE HORSE SHIT and carrying (legit 5 carts) of their shit so no one will sit on the whole bench because the stench is so bad! Let's not talk about the signal issues going from the Bronx-Man...I swear like every day! Or being held up from a sick ""passenger"" for 20-25. I understand shit happens, I don't have an issue w/homeless ppl but damn these are the things you deal with commuting & I'm trying to get to work! On top of seeing shit like someone clipping their nails right behind you or a girl w/a fuckin hamster on her shoulder (ike that's normal), or these girls whipping out a dick on the 6train and sucking it like fuckin nothing!(Go to world star to see these hoes because I can't make this up man). You also gotta be alert for your phone, purse etc cause it gets real in NYC...you WILL get robbed if you aren't paying attention. Oh forget about if you are taking the Q67 bus in Queens...THE FUCKIN WORST LINE EVER! How do drivers not get in trouble for having ppl wait anywhere from 30-55min for a bus!?! Yes, you read that right.smh I can go on and on. I've clearly written a novel and can most certainly continue because this is what the MTA does to me...gets me hyped to ""pop off"" on someone. My last words will be that I agree with Jerome T in saying MTA= THE GREATEST SHIT SHOW ON EARTH  (but I have no choice in taking it) FML!!! Tip: Ppl are fuckin IRATE in NYC...especially during rush hour. I suggest throwing your headphones on to tune out ppl and their nonsense to avoid an incident. Also, like stated above be alert no matter who/how old/race etc of the belongings."

153,5 star rating,"Jul 20, 2013","The MTA is the best public transportation system in America. If it sounds like I'm bragging, consider:* You can ride for miles on just $2.50 - less if you buy a monthly pass - and monthly and pay-as-you-go cardholders alike enjoy unlimited free transfers. Even a beater car or truck will cost you more in the long run. * No matter where you live in the 5 boroughs, your destination is less than an hour away, so long as you know how to take the bus and can understand the coverage maps. Before you throw your hands up and declare the system too confusing to bother with, take an afternoon to memorize the maps. It really helps. * The stations are safe, and most are quiet and acceptably clean. Many folks have vivid memories of MTA trains and stations in the Beame/Koch years and the customer experience has improved by leaps and bounds since then. * Manhattan coverage is arranged on a logical grid system, and identifying which lines take you where is a breeze if you think about them as ""the Lex"" instead of ""4/5/6"" or ""6th Ave. line"" instead of ""B/D/F/M.""* Even if you live beyond a train line, such as in far Eastern Queens or Southern Brooklyn, you will find multiple buses that take you where you need to go. * Most lines run 24/7/365, unlike any other public transit system in the USA.Are our trains and buses sometimes late, occasionally missing (during strikes or inclement weather), and infrequently smelly? Sure. And it also sucks to pay $2.50 per trip if you're used to getting anywhere in NYC for a dollar. But keep in mind that you live in America, a nation of millions who worship the personal automobile and refuse to fund city infrastructure ('cause it's a ""handout"") while demanding that city taxpayers grant them free highway upgrades and low-cost parkway tolls (""they owe me"") across thousands of cul-de-sacs, gated communities, and exurbs in all 50 states. You'll be hard-pressed to find a better transit system without a passport and a pricy plane ticket to capital cities like London and Tokyo. So the only folks who can legitimately complain are those who grew up outside the U.S. Take a deep breath, check the map, swipe your card, and enjoy the ride. The MTA will get you there in the big maze known as NYC."

Join New York City's most mediocre in their quest to legally steal exorbitant sums of money from NYC's hard-working lower and middle class citizens. Love schadenfreude and watching humans suffer? The subways are the place for you! Here you'll be able to inflict pain daily and see people squirm as they try to breathe intolerably hot air rife with the smell of body fluids and pollution. Maybe you're more into exacting physical pain? Not to worry! You can operate the train doors and allow them to close on people, or, if you're especially ambitious, orchestrate a full derailment! Ensuring that our trains are consistently late and overcrowded makes for hilarious scenes of people just trying to squeeze in before the train pulls away. If you time it just right, you may be able to trap a mother AND HER BABY in the doors! So don't delay! Work for the MTA today, and see why our motto is, ""Hey, you wanna get off that crosstown bus? That'll be $100 fine, and no, we don't care that you already paid the fare!"" (Our motto is long, just like our delays, but we're working on it. Just kidding, WE DON'T WORK!)"

It takes a second and sometimes third swipe for it to open.  Each beep is my fare being charged again and again.  Einstein working in the MTA booth always refuses to issue me a credit or refund saying it's my fault.  Also, I couldn't believe the shuttle between Grand Central and Times Square wasn't running on a Sunday.  Ridiculous.  Thank god I don't need to ride this cranky dinosaur very often and only when I visit NYC."

157,1 star rating,"Jun 4, 2017",".Honestly the MTA doesn't even deserve a one or a zero, what rating does pure and utter hell get? If they were getting a grade, they wouldn't even get an F, they should be expelled and banned for a lifetime. Seriously there are no words to describe how terrible it is to ride on the hot mess that is the MTA subway but I will try. *sigh * In the past two months I have not made a SINGLE RIDE without a delay or ""train traffic"". I ride 2-3 times a day. I often have to leave 2 hours ahead of time because who knows how many delays may occur. You could literally travel 100 miles or more or go through 2 states in the time it takes to go to Queens to Manhattan. Human piss and feces in the train cars are the norm, I shouldn't have to gag and hold back throw up (which if I did throw up and couldn't clean up myself would probably stay there until it crusted over.) on my commute. Many of the cars don't have ACs in the summer, my experience on the 123 train last year (2016) was 2 out of 3 times the cars did not have air which is difficult if you have asthma. Often times I opted to take an Uber, being able to breathe is a priority but obviously the MTA doesn't take that seriously. I've seen people being carried out on stretchers from heat exhaustion (example 14th St F stop and Jay Metro R train 2016). Trains change over to another line or skip stops without any announcements. The irony of it all is that as I write this the F train conductor all of a sudden announces the Queens bound train is now going back to Brooklyn and that we all need to get off. The only thing worse than having to deal with the MTA on a regular basis is having Trump as President."

I had to head into the city (I live in downtown Brooklyn.

Thank goodness for that. They did try their best."
159,4 star rating,"Dec 7, 2012","The subway is by far the best- quickest and cheapest- way to get from borough to borough and back, as well as a quick jaunt up just about ANY avenue.  The only two problems with the MTA are cleanliness and temperature control (in stations) and for this I can't really blame them because most of their system is running underground 24 hours a day, all that traffic leaving little time for servicing and cleaning. I am disgruntled and upset by MTA's lack of a consistent refund policy. Metrocards expire in a year window. During the two years after that, you have to trade in your card, but that process is way more difficult than it needs to be.  Perhaps it wouldn't be so difficult if I had been told that certain new machines can issue refunds for up to 12 months, and I am just beyond that point now. Terrible training and conflicting information regarding when and how to get a refund. That's the peril you will face if you buy 4.5 rides on one card just to get the 70 cent bonus. Perhaps I should have paid full fare a la carte with paper tickets instead of involving myself in the money waste that is a stored value card. The savings sounds good until you do the percentages and find out how much excess money gets left on the card after usage and reloading."

Consistently unreliable service and delay after delay, lousy attitudes by employees, garbage trains, horrible communication, lack of upgrades, lack of cleanliness, horribly tourist unfriendly....it's a third world subway system. I've been living in NY my entire life, and just when I think it can't get worse...another delay."
161,4 star rating,"Sep 13, 2013","We always use the subway when we're in town. If you take a few minutes to familiarize yourself with the layout, it get you where you want to go.  For the benefit of out of towners, I would make a few suggestions to the system:1. MORE MAPS EVERYWHERE. Before and after the turnstiles, on the platforms, everywhere. The London Underground is plastered with maps and it really helps.2. LIST THE STATIONS AT THE PLATFORMS. London Underground has a list of stations that each line stops at, on the wall facing commuters as they board the train. It's hard to get on the wrong train if you see your stop on the station list.3. Keep upgrading the stations. I know urban grunge chic, but c'mon...That said, NYC subway is THE model for public transit in the USA, it really works and it should be copied everywhere."

This is absolutely, without a doubt, as good as it will ever get for the MTA and I don't mean that as a veiled dis either. The subway system is old and massive; 468 stations spread out over 4 of the 5 boroughs (not including the SIRR of course). The sheer amount of volume it handles is staggering, so of course it can be filthy, require constant construction, have weekend service cuts bordering on severe for some lines, etc. I pose this one question for the standard MTA hater; Can you imagine NY functioning without it?Sandy was a colossal bummer for sure, and the slow recovery messed me up big time. Yes it is pricier than it was, and the price is going up. I still consider it the main lifeblood holding NYC together. For all the times I've waited 25 minutes for a train to take my drunk ass home only to see the station cleaning posse arrive there have been other times where I've made it from Manhattan to the outer boroughs in much less time than a car would take.

Don't put a lot of money in your metro card.  If you have a problem -NO ONE will help you (see below) -just get the single ride ($2.50).  The bad - We had problem with our Metro cards (1damaged and 1 damaged and double charged).   Nobody was willing to help us our problem. The operator told us we had to buy brand new Metro cards and handed us a form to fill out and mail in to get a refund.    The forms were a pain in the a** to fill out because it required detail information that nobody would even remember or know about( but lucky for us we kept all our receipts).  I'm still waiting to see if we will actually get a refund.   After our terrible experience with the metro cards, we decided whenever we need to take the subway we brought  the single ride tickets ($2.50 per ride)  instead of the Metro card even though it would have save us a little money ($2.25 per ride)."

174,2 star rating,,"I had a similar experience as a previous poster regarding EasyPay.  I had purchased an EasyPay Metrocard thinking it would simplify and quicken my daily commute. Firstly, I applied for the card online, and did not receive the card for over 3 weeks. Then, after sometime, the card stopped working and told me to report to an agent (who simply told me to call EasyPay).  It took another 4 weeks to receive a new card.  Recently, I noticed that I had lost my card and reported it as soon as I realized.  Then I began getting all these large charges on my credit card from EasyPay (even though I had set up a specific replenish amount that was nowhere near the amount of these charges).  When I called EasyPay, they told me that I was still responsible for this over $200 charge because it was incurred before I reported the card lost.  If you go into my activity, you will see the general pattern of where and when I use the card, and the sudden influx of uses once it was lost (over 30 uses in one single day at the same location that is NOWHERE near where I use my card). Even though the woman I spoke to agreed that there was an obvious misuse of my card, she said that I am still responsible for the cost. They need to fix this problem so that it doesn't happen again or to anyone else.  I have family and friends in other cities around the world who have a similar metrocard system, but have never had to deal with such an archaic way of dealing with situations like these."

176,1 star rating,"Jun 12, 2017","I had a similar experience as a previous poster regarding EasyPay.  I had purchased an EasyPay Metrocard thinking it would simplify and quicken my daily commute. Firstly, I applied for the card online, and did not receive the card for over 3 weeks. Then, after sometime, the card stopped working and told me to report to an agent (who simply told me to call EasyPay).  It took another 4 weeks to receive a new card.  Recently, I noticed that I had lost my card and reported it as soon as I realized.  Then I began getting all these large charges on my credit card from EasyPay (even though I had set up a specific replenish amount that was nowhere near the amount of these charges).  When I called EasyPay, they told me that I was still responsible for this over $200 charge because it was incurred before I reported the card lost.  If you go into my activity, you will see the general pattern of where and when I use the card, and the sudden influx of uses once it was lost (over 30 uses in one single day at the same location that is NOWHERE near where I use my card). Even though the woman I spoke to agreed that there was an obvious misuse of my card, she said that I am still responsible for the cost. They need to fix this problem so that it doesn't happen again or to anyone else.  I have family and friends in other cities around the world who have a similar metrocard system, but have never had to deal with such an archaic way of dealing with situations like these."

The trains are always delayed and stop randomly with no warning. Especially considering how much money their passes cost, the service they provide is shoddy and unreliable. I hate the MTA."

You ain't nothin'!"" -- DarylPeeling paint aside, Hoyt-Schermerhorn gets five stars for its cinematic history alone. The station has hosted a who's who of music and Hollywood heavyweights, including Michael Jackson, Martin Scorsese, Sidney Lumet, Eddie Murphy, Wesley Snipes, Michael J. Fox and Diana Ross. The mezzanine area brings back fond childhood memories as the filming site of Michael Jackson's 'Bad' video, while the subway platforms have been featured in classics such as 'Coming to America,' 'the Warriors' and 'the Wiz.'Besides, what other subway station bridges the worlds of Daryl (BAD) and Darryl Jenks (the Prince of Soul Glo)?"

184,2 star rating,"Jul 4, 2012","The temperature in the actual stations and on the platforms when it's over 90°F outside, feels like it's only somewhat cooler, with all the heat trapped inside, so take note that it will be quite hot inside, while you're walking through the stations and waiting on the platforms.  Inside the trains, it wasn't that bad - at least the ones I went on were all air-conditioned.  The speed and frequency, when it comes to how fast and often the trains arrive and depart, were pretty fast and frequent for the most part.  I used the Metro about 5-6 times during my few days in Manhattan and although I was glad to have been able to get to my destination and back in a relatively quick amount of time -- overall, I wasn't too impressed with it.  Really sucks if you have a problem with your MetroCard though, especially if you happen to encounter a problem with it at an entrance/exit point where there appears to be absolutely no station agent staffing available at all.  If you already paid and the turnstile doesn't work, for example, you're pretty much screwed so you'll have no choice (unless you want to pay your fare twice) but hopefully have someone open the emergency exit door to let you in/out, which of course sets off a loud alarm.  And adding more $ on that existing MetroCard that's not working though, unfortunately does not solve anything nor does it make it work, as we learned, so please do not do that.  You will need to just buy a single-ride ticket and try again.  We thought that inserting the current MetroCard we had into the machines to add more fare would spew out a new one (as some transportation systems do), but this is not the case. The turnstile system here is at times particularly tricky in my opinion and I especially would advise against using the high entrance-exit turnstile, called ""HEET"" (the cage-like revolving doors), unless you absolutely have to.  I understand how the whole concept works and the reason for having these types of turnstiles is to curb fare-beaters from jumping the low-bar turnstiles, but the designs of the HEETs are just simply not user friendly.  Yes, it's to most people, simple and straight-forward since all you do is swipe your MetroCard, step straight ahead and push the bars forward, but of course, things can and do go wrong.  I personally didn't have any problems with it, but I had witnessed a number of people having trouble with it.  If you incorrectly push the wrong set of bars, the turnstiles won't work.  Or if you step into the wrong opening of the HEET (slightly left of center) the turnstile will rotate in the correct counter-clockwise direction, for a few feet, then it locks again.  Re-swiping your MetroCard because you thought it didn't read correctly without looking at the display, will charge you twice for one ride.  I learned afterwards that even regular/long-time riders will tell you to avoid the HEETs if possible and rather use the waist-heigh turnstiles if available.  In general, I would give one star for the Metro for being available to take you around from point A to point B and one star for the frequency and speed.  Though much more complicated (in terms of the sheer amount of the different lines/platforms), the JR subway system in Japan on the other hand, was to me, much more better overall."

189,1 star rating,"Jan 9, 2014","On 12/16/13, I signed up and paid for an EasyPay MetroCard that refills automatically. It's supposed to arrive in 3 weeks. It hasn't, and the card I'm using now is expiring, Sunday, 1/12/14. I called. The MTA admitted that, because of fraud in their offices, the card wasn't mailed and they cancelled it. Any chance they'll FedEx the replacement? No. So now I have to buy another card in the interim, for which I will have to chase the MTA for a refund of any unused balance. Is this perhaps a scam the MTA is perpetrating on the public to increase revenue, by getting people to buy MetroCards they won't fully use? Please write if you have had similar experiences."
190,1 star rating,"Oct 17, 2015","If ridership is up, what is the purpose of raising the fare when the service gets worse? Trains run less frequently, they are jam packed even in non rush hours, piling in like slop hogs and much of the track work they do is likely unnecessary. And they work like snails. Litter in trains, deadbeats panhandling, and they shorten too many trains. And anyone with a backpack that doubles their girth has no business entering a crowded train."

I keep hearing: ""it's an old subway system"" as if that is a great excuse for me having to pay $125/month for having to hang out 20 min in the station, with the rats, waiting for the train... Let me tell you, it's old alright...and not getting any younger!!!!!!!!!"
194,1 star rating,"Sep 9, 2015","I have been a regular customer of the MTA (and Metro North) since 2000. Overall I have to say that their level of service is very very poor. While the New York City public transit system is a much larger enterprise than most others there is no excuse for such a sub par level of service. There are so many things wrong, but the most glaring issue is the complete lack of transparency and communication to the general public. The Paris metro system is a prime example of how a large metropolis can get it right."

Wish we had the Metro in the Bay Area.   Be prepared for late night train closures.... a normal 15 min ride can turn into a 1 hour adventure.  Hey but it's still a NY adventure!"
