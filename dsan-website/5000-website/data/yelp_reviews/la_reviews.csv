6,3 star rating,"Mar 13, 2022","If you've spent two hours sitting in your car trying to get from Santa Monica to Glendale, you likely come to the conclusion Joni Mitchell made: ""They paved paradise and put up a parking lot."" The traffic is so bad that there was enough time for an entire opening credits production number in ""La La Land"". Being stalled on the 405 motivated Jamie W. and me to try the LA Metro for the very first time. We heard mixed things about the subway, but what the hell.Mixed was how we felt after our inaugural round trip. We each bought a one-day pass for $3.50, half off the regular $7, by adding Tap cards to our Apple Wallets. We got on the Red Line at the cavernous Civic Center/Grand Park station and took it nine stops to the evocative Hollywood/Vine station which features Art Deco palm trees and miles of empty film reels on the station ceiling. That part of the experience was kinda cool, but the train itself was well worn...There was a surly vibe to the onboarding passengers. After nine stops, I could see why. Random yelling. Bros chugging beers. Seniors left standing. Few masks. But there was no getting around the convenience or the bargain price point. Maybe because LA is all about the car culture, the subway didn't feel as indispensable as the NYC Metro. We had a better experience later that day using our pass for the 4 bus to WeHo on Santa Monica Blvd. Perhaps LA won't be too much for the man.RELATED - Exploring LA?

We told her to go to Slauson and make left. And she can't communicate and explain to any one what is going on because she doesn't speak Spanish. Fortunately a gentleman who is bilingual was able to translate. On another note I  believe a driver should be able to communicate to the people of the line/area they are working.Update she made a u-ey at 40 something and long beach back to Vernon. We told her to go straight  to Pacific

So thanks Metro for making me late for work. I  hope I don't get fired! Edit  5am bus came. Says freeway was closed. If there was an alert I could have taken an alternate route. Two other options. How hard to have an alert? On web site or app? I could possibly lose my job! BIG FAILURE METRO! Edit 2. Seriously! bus is on wrong street. I had to ask are you lost? No bus is on detour. Driver never informed us. Ppl ha to get off. We don't know which way hes going. Bus 8547 on Soto going north. Cant make this up.

15,1 star rating,"Jun 19, 2020",I'm confused. Why are some buses making me come in the front and some the back? Even when I step to the back they only open the front door. It's bad enough the buses are so packed there are no seats and every one is touching each other cuz the front half the bus is literally tied up with the wheelchair straps. It's no wonder the hispanics have a high covid rate. Newsome check that! Btw some drivers ask for payment some don't. Which is it? 06/23 same 605 has ppl enter in front and tap is social distancing over?.

SANTA MONICA STATION THIS TIME... we arrived at the santa monica  station and the metro wanna be police aka tap card crew were demanding tap cards from the riders... ok  lets see did you ask for the tap cards from the homeless bums with the garbage bags cigarettes .. which they are not supposed to be smoking.. waiting to ride around free while working people pay.. this is about the 100th time that I have seen this and when I spoke wit a metro employee on the platform.. they said "" of course the paying passengers get hasseled because the bums are no fun..."" will be filing with the Federal Dept of transportation.  Maybe if metro gets their free money restricted maybe they will start treating the riders that follow the rules and pay better than they treat the homeless. Just make it free or make everyone pay. its not that hard people...idiots!"

24,1 star rating,"Apr 19, 2023",The bus from San Gabriel to Sierra Madre Villa ditched us at the bus stop and left us stranded in the freezing cold. A large group of us were huddled near the bus stop eagerly awaiting its arrival and watched with horror as the incompetent bus driver proceeded to drive past us into the distance and leave us in the dust. I'll give him the benefit of the doubt and assume that a seagull magically flew by the bus and somehow covered his peripherals. Even though it was late at night there is no excuse for us to be left there when there was a lamppost right next to us to illuminate our sad and forlorn faces. We were left to wait in a bubble tea shop nearby for the next bus which was almost one hour later: in sadness.

This is how the homeless are boarding and making the bus an uncomfortable place.  Two days ago (posting this on May 28, 2023), the Metro board approved the agency's $9 billion fiscal year 2023-24 budget.  Thats $9 billion with a B.Shouldn't the bus be a better and safe place for everyone?  $9 billion.  What a joke."

EVERY.DAY!!!I'd say, if you're taking the metro AT ANY TIME, make sure you wear a bulletproof vest, a gas mask and, have hand sanitizer, cause the LA Metro is NEVER tended to in benefit to riders and is JUST as dangerous as South Detroit.The way our politicians handle the metro, just shows how corrupt the city is, see how with ALLLLLLLL the money we pay in taxes, non of this should be happening. But it is so, that means NO ONE is doing their job! And we regular train riders have to suffer. I would advise no one to take the train.It's dangerousIt's grossAnd it's offensive that we pay for it TWICE and, nothing is being taken care of. Do not take the metro, IT'S HIGHLY DANGEROUS!!!!"

33,1 star rating,"Jun 24, 2023","Until recently I would have given the LA Metro System a much higher rating. My beef with them is their new Stored Value payment system for the buses & subway. I am a senior and for years I have been getting a monthly pass for unlimited use for $20 a month! The new Fare Capping system with stored value on your tap card is going to cost Seniors & the disabled who only ride the bus a few times a week MUCH MORE than the old $20 Monthly passes! Why would LA Metro want to add even more hardship to it's senior & disabled riders? IT REALLY SUCKS! Now, instead of the ease of adding my $20 for a pass at the beginning of the month I am going to have to keep an eye on my Stored value & if I run out of money ( which I do EVERY month trying to live on SS Retirement ) I will have no money left to ride the bus & be stranded. I would like to thank the IDIOTS at LA Metro for this added hardship to both the Senior & Disabled communities of the LA area. Inflation is already crushing us & now you just have to go and ruin it for us all even more. Why screw-up something that was working fine for us? Because, you obviously do not care even one minute iota about us seniors or disabled!"
34,1 star rating,"Jun 19, 2023","A good system to use as a taxpayer but maintain poorly from a sanitary perspective. After homeless people pee on the elevators, why not hire people to clean the elevators with a mop with bleach? Spent lots of money to build a Metro system and I do not see a cleaning person to maintain it for the taxpayer to use pleasantly. instead, it is used by homeless people for dumping their body secretions and sleeping. The urine smell in the elevator in the Wilshire and Western is worse than any third-world country public toilet, I do not understand where the taxpayer money goes."

44,1 star rating,"May 18, 2022","This is a general review of the LA Metro, and I'm sure it's unsurprising, as it's a negative one. I've been riding it on/off since I've moved here in 2012 and I can't tell you how many times I've been let down by the unreliable system. From public safety issues to trains/buses being late or completely never showing up, it's awful. It's affordable, which I'll give credit for, but it's inconsistently truly drags down the system overall. I couldn't imagine commuting via public transit to work every day in LA. Depending on where you're at, you'd need to plan 2-3 hours MINIMUM to even make it to your destination on time. Don't be surprised, however, if you plan way ahead and still end up late to your destination."

46,1 star rating,"Jan 25, 2023","I rode the Metro Green/C line for many years. It had its issues but was efficient. After returning to riding the train in recent months, I was shocked at the decline in security and cleanliness. Transients take over a lot of space on the trains and inhabit the stations. I was ""treated"" to a screaming fit by an unstable woman who was halfway across the car for being ""too close."" I've been stalked and harassed; people regularly smoke marijuana and other things on platforms and in the trains with no consequences. The final straw was getting a parking ticket that Metro refuses to dismiss on a technicality even though I paid the fee. Continuing to fight it would cost me more money. I'd rather put my money into paying for gas instead of continuing to compromise my safety, sanity and dignity by riding Metro."

I asked the bus driver what is the official time the bus is scheduled to arrive. His answer was ""what does it say on the internet. I have missed this bus because it was 5-10 minutes EARLY. Then late to work because the following bus driver drove ridiculously slow. Sundays, sometimes the bus doesn't come at all. I've called customer support and I was told ""the bus is on time but it's a little behind schedule."" Your service is atrocious and some of your drivers have no people skills. Asking a question shouldn't result in me being asked to get off the bus or the police will be called and I paid. If I could give u 0 stars I would. Can't wait for my car to be fixed."

If you're looking to explore LA, go on the weekends, it's not busy at all.Although the bathrooms on the train is kept in good conditions, I still recommend checking toilet paper, trash bin more frequently."

59,2 star rating,"Dec 3, 2018","I wanted to leave a public comment on what is perhaps a glaring oversight of Metro Los Angeles. If you look at the public transit rail system for Southern California, there is a place in Santa Fe Springs/Norwalk where they should have combined the LA Metrorail Green line station at Hoxie Avenue, Norwalk with the Amtrak station on Imperial Hwy to allow people from San Diego County and Orange County to access LAX and the LA Metrorail with better ease. If you look at a map (picture uploaded to this review), the stations are 10 minutes away from each other. Given this glaring oversight, at the very least, there needs to be another Green Line station at this Amtrak station to combine the public railway systems. It's a no-brainer that would have been done decades ago in any European country."

My hopes of working here was blown into pieces due to the instructors have their 'favorite ' students they want to push FORWARD in the classroom.  If you are VERY outspoken or very outgoing,  they don't want to deal with you! Well the TWO male instructors I had were like that and they were racists against afro American women.  I would suggest you do your homework on this company BEFORE  applying to it. The senority will also talk about you and find someway to degrade you amongst their 'crew'!! Being trained by this company is like being in a hazing for a  sorority! Just being honest"

62,1 star rating,"Jan 21, 2021","I've traveled and worked all over the world. I've never posted on the Metro bus system although I've ridden it on multiple occasions. I'm just too exhausted and demoralized after each ride. The bus system is so wracked with inconvenient routes, long waits for transfers, and the worst punctuality for schedule keeping, even compared to impoverished developing nations. The Swiss and Japanese bus systems aren't in Metro's aspirations. The NYC bus system is light years ahead of you, Metro."
63,1 star rating,"Jan 6, 2020","How is anyone even giving this two stars? Is it that same mentality that is indicative of ""you have a beating heart"" followed by a trophy for breathing and ""here are your accolades for involuntary respiration!!! Keep up the good work!"" There is literally no excuse for the subpar public transportation in Los Angeles, the second largest city in the United States. If Los Angeles can create movies that make Scarlett Johansson look like she can act, then we should be able to expect more from our public transportation than what we have currently. Honestly, even gophers are better at this than we are. So are earthworms. And they don't even have eyeballs. Getting from Point A to Point B need not involve ten switchovers with imbecilic waiting times. Also important: the 5:1 ratio between the severely unhinged commuters and the rest of us, i.e. the marginally mentally ill commuters that keep hoping today will be different when we look at the Metro's time schedule and expect it to be only *slightly* incorrect. If more expansive cities that are ten times the size of LA can figure out how to efficiently and semi-safely whoosh millions of people around the various regions of a metropolitan area, so should and can LA."

68,4 star rating,"Feb 4, 2018","Overall for such a large transit system Metro isn't to bad. As for the bus, you can take the local which are the orange busses. If you are able to take the Rapid which are red use it. They have much fewer stops. Make sure your stop is one they use.The Red and Purple lines can be pretty ghetto. It smells of homelessness. Several homeless spend the entire day on the trains sleeping until they get kicked off. They will just board another car. You might have a musician on your car playing for donations. If you hear bells jingling then Incense man is aboard selling his stinky incense. Well at least it smells better than the homeless. I've only been on the Green line a couple times but its ghetto. Not as bad as Red and Purple but still ghetto. Blue and Expo aren't to bad. They have more vendors than any line I've been on. One was even selling beer. Expo is nicer of the two with newer cars.Gold is the nicest of them all. The cars are new and clean. I haven't seen bums or vendors yet. We all know L.A. traffic. sometimes it's so bad your bus may run behind schedule. There may be back to back busses due to the later bus catching up with yours. It's a big city so it doesn't bother me."
69,1 star rating,"Mar 24, 2019","The Metro rail system in Los Angeles started as a good idea.  It has turned into one giant piece of human excrement..LITERALLY.  Human excrement everywhere, on all trains.  Take a swab of the seats and have it analyzed.  Ecoli galore.  That means ""caca.""  Yes, ""caca"" on the seats and handles.  ""Caca"" in the vending machines where your change comes out.   One dark, giant underground wormhole of sickness.  I'll wait 4 hours in traffic before I subject my body to the disease, danger, filth and craziness that is the Metro rail system.And cities in the eastern part of Los Angeles County want this in their community?

I just moved to LA back in June and I thought people were supposed to be nice and professional. Anyway, these past six months I've been riding the bus and all the other drivers said go through the back. I'm not asking for an apology, because humans like her don't do that. However, can she be injected with Covid and crucified upside down like St. Peter before she's fired and living on the streets? That would be very greatly appreciated. Have a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year."

I was on my way to work & was nearly crushed by one of your damn drivers; license plate: 1288771.On Thursday, 12/04/14, 7:50 AM, I was heading east on the slow lane on Wilshire Blvd. (having just exited the 405 N), your driver was slightly behind me in the lane to my left when we pulled to a stop just before the corner of Wilshire Blvd. & Midvale Ave. S/he pulls almost parallel as we pass the intersection, then swerves into my lane between Midvale Ave. & Westwood Blvd. WTF!!!While blasting my horn, s/he kept driving into my lane, & I slammed on my brakes & drove up partially onto the driveway/sidewalk... luckily there were no pedestrians. I could have been seriously injured or killed! I was not in this driver's blind spot as my hood was partially in line/view of the front exit's glass doors.I always avoid driving near trucks, buses, or other large vehicles because I generally feel they are aggressive/careless drivers. I generally give them leeway when they need to merge into my lane, but this STUPID driver did not signal until after s/he was partially into my lane.Go back to driver's ed & get some training, or get some sleep so you don't cause accidents!! Instead of ""passing with caution,"" HOW ABOUT YOU DRIVE WITH CAUTION!?!?!!!!"

We started in Hollywood and went to downtown, Chinatown, Koreatown, Santa Monica and West Hollywood....easy, convenient and clean.During peak hours, the trains run every 6 minutes or so...during off peak hours, they run every 12 minutes...still a great way to get around the large sprawling city of LA."

76,1 star rating,"Apr 18, 2018","How immensely and profoundly incompetent.Trains that stop at red lights, waiting minutes, a few meters from the drop off point, and designed that way...They'll stop midway between stops to do a driver shift change. They could do it at the end of the line, like every other system, in every other city, in every other country. But no, with a few hundred people on board, they mozy on off the train, have another person stroll on over and finish the last 15 minutes (1 mile) of the route.The trains themselves run every 20 minutes. In the third world it's every 2. The drivers slam the brakes constantly and everyone falls over each other. Then the doors open, and they stay open, sometimes for 5 minutes, often in fact. Just to waste everyone's time.It's swarming with drunks and homeless and the only thing the police are doing is checking whether the people rushing to their meeting in business suits paid the $1.75, oh thank heavens.The announcement system is basically random messages being played at random times about unrelated exits.I mean, it's a giant joke like out of some novel lampooning incompetence. And they have money, gobs of it. More than almost any system in the world. And we get piles of brake slamming, delayed trains, stopping at red lights and drunk people vomiting on you.Fucking awesome guys, great job."

88,2 star rating,"Sep 19, 2019",I read that ridership is decreasing on LA buses. It is a service that I need and use. Wish there was better communication with passengers when buses will be 40 minutes late. Either a communication board or an actual person to relay information about alternative transportation. The internet services are not accurate. Place treat us with respect and I guarantee there will be more ridership.
89,2 star rating,"Oct 5, 2018",PROS: 1. I'm very happy they're building up the rail system again. At least there will be a better system in the future to look forward to.2. Cheaper than Uber and Lyft.CONS:1. Very long wait times for both trains and buses. The Red and Purple Lines should run every 5 minutes at night not every 20 minutes. 20 minutes is a lot of wasted time especially if you just missed a train. Blue and Expo lines have better service frequency but the trains move too slowly in Downtown L.A. Buses often run only every 45-60 minutes on Melrose Ave. west of Vine Street. Poor service frequency on Robertson Blvd. where buses only run once an hour and shut down on weekends. I stopped using most buses because of the long wait times and short-line service (where some buses only go to Vine St. which makes the wait times for West Hollywood double.) Uber is far more reliable. The free tap card passes and the rail system are the only reasons why I still take Metro.2. Elevator and Escalator breakdowns are a major problem in Metro stations especially if you have a bike or are wheelchair bound. The Red and Purple line stations are huge and deep. It's not always possible to take the stairs.3. Some Metro vehicles are in bad condition. Red and Purple line trains need to be refurbished. The floors are falling apart and decals peeling off. Some buses are too old and need to be replaced. Don't just put new CNG tanks on a 15 year old bus and put it back in service. Order new buses.I would support increased sales taxes for service improvements because I know most of these problems are mainly funding related.

I like it. On a recent vacay, I saved cab fare by taking the Metro and Lax flyaway to the airport.  Total savings?  $50, one way.   Taxi?  NAH, not when there's a $50 price difference. Super Shuttle?  Not anymore, I don't wanna go on a neighborhood tour before going to the airport for $30.  Nor do I want to go on a La Nauseè ride 6 times around the airport and a neighborhood tour coming home.  No Thanks.  Not when I can take the Metro and the FlyAway to the Airport.  Love this Gold Line.    The cars feel like a Disney ride..  still beaucoup fun.  Save money and you're contributing to the cause!  Hell yeah!Tip:  For travelers coming to El-Lay, you can take the LAX Flyaway to Union Station from LAX, and Metro it to downtown, Hollywood, Long Beach,  North Hollywood.  LA is no longer a car only town, of sorts.  Must get a Tap Card at Union Station to use the metro at  $1.50 per ride.  LAX Flyaway takes Debit/Credit Cards only, $8 one way."

Seating can get limited during peak times, and make sure to bring sanitizer after holding onto bars or poles. There are some interesting characters, but there's no real way to prevent this so enjoy the people watching! *There are also quite a few people asking for money: As a safety precation do not take wallet or money out. Ladies keep purses secured infront of you because there is a lot of bumping and close contact as well as possible distractions, I'd imagine it would be easy for someone to slip a hand in a purse to grab various items without you paying attention to the movement."

I know from last year that some of you are even going to take your little ones out past midnight. Here's some tips:Gold Line- Safest and cleanest of the many lines- 30 minutes from Sierra Madre Station to Union Station- May or may not come with crazy peopleRed Line- You lucky SOBs! If this were rush hour between the hours of 5 and 6 pm, you'd be squished in like sardines. Lucky for you, it will be 2 am when you get on.- About 30 minutes from Union Station to the North Hollywood station. Super convenient to get around Downtown. - Watch out for drunken SantasBlue Line- You may want to say a little prayer before getting on. you'll need some divine intervention to make it from Downtown to Long Beach without being bothered by gangsters, potheads, grownups selling candy, homeless people, crazy people, preachers, and dudes with boomboxes....yah, they still exist.- About one hour-ish to Long Beach. Expect an excruciatingly painful stop in Downtown as you watch dozens of people walk past you while you don't go anywhere. Expo Line- Through Downtown to USC - Blue Line applies- Past USC to Culver City - Gold Line appliesGreen Line- Someone's going to have to update me on that one...All lines:- Teenagers may or may not be annoying- Stay safe. Don't be so drunk you don't know your surroundings, or at least travel with someone who does. Have fun and Happy New Year!"

106,3 star rating,"Apr 26, 2013","For the one city where traffic is among the nation's worst, one would think more folks would use the LA Metro. It's not as clean as DC's metro system, as simple as Boston's, or as vast or cost effective NYC, but LA does a solid job for what it is. The trains run on time, they're not disgusting, and not terribly crowded even during rush hour.But people in these parts love to drive. The search for the nearest subway stop doesn't sound as appealing as the allure of a luxury valet. Safety is a concern for the late commuters, but if you don't bother anyone else, it's pretty unlikely they'd bother you. It also might stop in a popular area, but considering the urbal sprawl of the city, it's not exactly convenient with out the aid of a bus for the more rural areas.Then there is the TAP card. Day passes are still available and the per ride requirement can be bypassed with the honor system. Plenty of people have cheated their way past turnstyles and have taken advantage of the fact there is very little staff and/or onboard maintenance. That said, I haven't had a problem with any stalled cars or track issues.If the LA Metro can't save the smog or win the respect of its city, here's hoping that things  change down the (subway) line."

The Metro system takes riders all throughout Los Angeles County. Fee is $1.75 for a one way Trip. You can purchase a tap card for $1 which is reusable. Just load it with money before using! Day pass I believe is still $7 . back in the day, it was $5. I can understand with the inflation rate as to why it goes up. I have used just about every single bus line. Depending on the day or time, they usually run every 10 mins. During the weekends and the wee hours, they run a bit longer. Just about anywhere you want to go throughout Los Angeles, the Metro bus takes you there. This is my go to method whenever I choose to bar hop. I rather never drive while inebriated so just Metro bus it! The bus drivers can be from nice and chatty to just plain quiet! No eating or drinking is allowed on the bus inside. I will continues to use the Metro bus system. Monthly passes can vary. I believe they still accept bus tokens as well!!!"
108,3 star rating,"Apr 17, 2009","So I've lived in LA for a little over 3 years now. Long enough to claim residence in 4 zip codes (moving sucks) and soon to be a 5th(eh). Until recently, whether or not my commute was 5 blocks or 15 miles, I had always driven.When I moved to LA near South Pasadena I realized I was a short 5 minute ride to the Mission St. Metro stop. I wanted to try and use the line, but it wasn't until I started a new job in Hollywood where I was finally able to utilize it on a daily basis.  So far it has been great. I wake up at 7:30, shower and dress. By 8 am I am out the door and at the Mission St stop by about 8:15. It takes a minute to walk from where you park because it's 4 hour parking near the station to avoid a parking cluster.I always bring a book and my IPOD shuffle. I can usually  even find a seat. By about 8:30-40 I am at Union Station where I switch to the Red Line. I get to my stop at Hollywood/Vine at around 9 or so.  Then I have a nice 10 minute walk down to Santa Monica Blvd.It's been great! I save 50 bucks a week on gas, so now I don't mind eating out for lunch all the time. I also get a nice workout and have lost about 10 pounds in 2 weeks.Fortunately and unfortunately, I just signed a lease back in Hollywood (ironically near the Hollywood and Vince stop) BUT i will now be walking to work and still not paying for Gas--booyah!--HOWEVER--I gotta be fair and honest. Not all is kosher down under. The cliental that rides the tube is sketchy at best. I've gotten threatening looks from Cholos, almost puked because of a stinky hobo who stood too close to me, and had a few looney tunes start conversations with me. I could see how a woman might not feel comfortable alone. But from what I understand they have camera and a guard on every train.Give the metro a look. Even if you can't take it to work, you can probably find a route you can use. For example I plan on walking to the Hollywood and Vince spot and taking it to the Sunset/Vermont stop to go out in Los Feliz where I have some friends. Or even one stop east of that to go to this dive bar, Smog Cutter (see review).  They are expanding the Metro so you might as get on board!"

Cons: Red, purple expo and blue lines. Filled with degenerates, bums, homeless, and the mentally ill. Filthy people sleeping in trains and stationsCrazy dangerous people in trains and stations. Scumbags constantly jumping turnstiles. Security just looks on and does nothing. No restrooms in most stations. Union Station restroom is personal bath for bums and degenerates. No food or shopping in most stations. Recommendations. City officials need to put their ""big boy pants"" on and clean up the trash. I'm sure the Mayor has been to Europe?  Their cities  all have pay restrooms in stations with attendants. Great food options and shopping in most stations. Why hasn't he learned what a clean and efficient metro system looks like.

Driver pulls up around 737pm and pulls past me.  As I'm walking up to the back door the driver closes the door and speeds away.  I was the first person at the stop and they left without me.  Not to mention unreliable stop times that force you to arrive at your stop 25+ minutes early to be to work on time.  No formal complaints department.  I would like to be contacted by a supervising representative of Metro LA to answer my inquiries about restitution.

She wasn't helping anyone or anything. Then when I get to my stop she opens the door and asked why is everyone getting off the  bus as she was closing the door on people damn near almost hurting passengers. Without a care. She was annoyed SHE ALMOST INJURED 3 people trying to close the door. Who the hell hires these idiots they need to be fired as well as those bus drivers."

I've been using public transportation for years and I would never ride without having 2 pepper sprays handy. I appreciate that help is close by if needed because back in the day, you would be fu**** 1) there was no cellphone reception to call for help 2) the bystander effect is real in LA and people rather pull out their phone to record.

Whenever I take the purple line I only have time to make my lunch for tomorrow and head straight to bed. I take the blue 91/Perris line in the morning and HIGHLY recommend taking it back but it's hard if you miss the 5:30 train since the next one is at 6:50.

141,2 star rating,,"Dear Los Angeles Metro,I thought it would be fun to use public transportation for the day.  I see people do it on TV all the time.  However, it turned out that you are confusing as hell.  I was left fending for myself trying to figure out how you work.  So I bought myself a TAP card.  I was wondering if I can share a card and swipe it twice or do I need a card per person?  There was no one there for me to ask.  I had no clue where to swipe my card.  I saw someone swiping and I told my friend I think that round  thing is where you swipe.  She thought it was where you check to see how much money you have left.  She said I'm sure there is a turn stile that you tap to get through.  I asked a stranger that walked by,  he said just get on.  He never pays.  No one ever check on the weekend.  As tempting as it sounds, do I want to take that chance?  Failure to pay you can get fine up to $250 and 48 hours community service. Its only 1.50 to ride the metro, that's pocket change.   So I have my tap card, charged and ready to go.  Then I turned to my friend and asked  how do we know if we were going on the right train?  hmmm no one working to ask.  All I know is that I needed to take the gold line.  So I turned to some random stranger and said, ""Hey!  Where are you going?""  This lady said union station, I told her i was too and so we followed her like creepers.  I find it funny how ever time I asked a stranger where they were going they never hesitate to tell me.  I guess i'm not that suspicious looking.  I got on the metro.  made my way to the union station with my TAP card and all.  So it turned out that I meant to pay for my trip, but I never TAP my card because I'm clueless. That round thing that I saw  that was next to the TAP vending machine was where you were suppose to TAP. I actually played with it trying to figure out what it was for. I didn't know I was suppose to tap my card there.  It doesn't make sense.   I'm going to stick to driving, but I am still praying for teleportation."

I think it's great for commuters who hate traffic or can't afford the lifestyles of a car.i would take the metro everywhere like I did in NY, Chicago, and SF. But this Honor System system is total Bullsh*t. I walked with my friend to pay the fee $1.50 each way. And I noticed - there's NO doors, no gate, no passage... Just a open way for people to go in and out freely WITHOUT paying. Whaaaaaa...So people are mooching off the metro system... The money for the fees goes to taking care of the station. Are you kidding me that people can just get away with it? It's $3 for a round trip... And it goes to taking care of this metro... You seriously going to jip the system for $3. Classy.We paid and scanned the card and he told me its 'honor system'... I said loudly ""that sucks!!!"" as a woman who didn't scan anything and walked for FREE passed by and glared at me... Seriously, lady? I paid. F u for staring at me like I did something wrong. This place needs to be more secured. Seriously, there weren't any security either. Seriously?!? Remember the London Metro bombings? Wtf LA... One of the largest cities in the US. They really need to amp their security in ALL stations. You do KNOW that the metro goes to all the major LA cities which could be dangerous targets!!! Seriously! Wtf LA metro! We need security pronto and gated systems!This is embarrassing compared to all the other metro stations in the US. Thailand, a third world country, has a better metro system than you!!!There needs to be tighter security and actual paid gates to go through... How else are you going to take care of this system!? The honor system sucks! You're losing money! Seriously?!The metro did its job- Point A to Point B. it seriously is convenient but omg...But as a taxpayer and actually follows the honor system, I'm sooooo disappointed in this system and metro. It really discourages the honest people from even paying if no one else is paying. Yeah, there are cops there but not all the time... Its like whenever I see a douchebag using the carpool lane when he's not suppose to and never gets caught. Soooo irritating. I hope national security sees this and thinks ""shit, she may be right"""

It was such a pain driving from Claremont to Azusa and the traffic on the 210 corridor between Azusa and San Dimas shows that these cities need an AFFORDABLE subway-like public transit option. Compared to other city's public transportation costs, $1.75 is a deal! I use to pay $2.50+ for a one way trip back in 2009 for Tri-met in Portland, OR.

150,2 star rating,"Aug 10, 2012","If I had a car I would never even consider riding Metro. But since I don't have a car I must reply on Metro to get to where I need to be. The bus operators are rude and most times can be very nasty. Trains are never on time and just the other night I was stuck on the red line for 20 minutes and the conductor (if you can call them that) never said one word as to what was going on or when the train would move again. The cost to ride metro is far too much and TAP is a huge joke. Half the time my card never even give me the green ""enter"" light to get on. Even though it gets loaded every month.Security on METRO is the worst. In fact there is no such thing. The only thing I;ve ever seen the so called security or police do is write out tickets. Making sure the stations are safe and secure is not their number one priority. In fact I dont think it is a priority at all.The whole ""see something say something"" is nothing more then a poor attempt to make people feel safe. Who the heck are you supposed to say something to? There are no agents. Then they give you a number to call the police, but that is no good when you're underground.I've been on the Red, Blue and now the Expo Lines when fights have broken out. It takes the train operator forever to even answer the call button.If you ever try to use their trip planer it gives you routes that take forever. For example I wanted to get to Malibu from Hollywood. It had me walk 4 blocks down to Sunset to get the 2 or 302 and then transfer to the 217 or 780 to Venice and Fairfax to get the 534 to Malibu. I could have just taken the 2 or 302 to PCH and caught the 534 to Malibu, but this was not an option.Santa Monica Municipal Bus Line (Big Blue Bus) is far superior to Metro. Their buses are on time, clean, safe and the drivers are friendly and very helpful. I was so happy when Big Blue Bus introduced the 7 Rapid to the Wilshire and Western Station. I wish they could run buses to Hollywood where I live. But I will soon be back in Santa Monica where I will never have to ride metro unless I want to"

Just now it cost me a ticket on Amtrak that I pre-paid for, since the 10 bus decided not show up at all to go to Union Station. Yes, I absolutely made sure I had the right bus, bus stops, and times. Maybe L.A. Metro has something against Santa Monica? Hey, I can't help it if it the air is better here.What a bummer. If I can't depend on a bus system to get me where I need to go at the time I need to get there, why would I ever want to use it? I still use it now and then, but my desire to be more car-free simply can't be fulfilled with a bus system like this."

Getting the 20 miles from our home in Woodland Hills to Hollywood can take anywhere from 30 minutes to and hour and a half... and you never know which to expect. So, when we go to the Pantages or El Cap to see a show, we just always leave 90 minutes (or more!) ahead. Getting to the Dorothy Chandler can take up to 2 hours. Then you have to find a spot to park the car and pay about $12 for the privilege.We've been eyeing the Warner Transportation Center and the Metro Orange Line for some time as a possible alternative. So, this past Monday we decided to ride it all the way to Union Station (which includes a transfer in N. Hollywood to the Metro Red Line) and get some Cielito Lindo taquitos to celebrate Cinco De Mayo.Buying tickets is easy. The machine is intuitive and accepts cash, coins and cards. One way is $1.25. An all day pass is $5. Metro Orange Line buses leave about every 8-10 minutes or so. They're comfortable enough, though not plush. The ride from Woodland Hills to N. Hollywood took about 40 minutes. The transfer to the Red Line was painless and the ride from N. Hollywood to Union Station took another 35 minutes for a total 1 hour 15 minutes from Woodland Hills to Union Station. That is about the same time it would take in a car! Plus, I didn't have to find and pay for parking when I got there. Frankly, unless we need the car to get around once we get downtown, I don't see any reason to not take the Metro. It's just as fast, and with the price of gasoline and parking... CHEAPER!We need to visit a friend in Long Beach soon. I think we can take the Metro all the way in about 2 hours for $1.25 per person each way. That's a $5 round trip from Woodland Hills to Long Beach in about the same time it would take me to drive. What's not to love?"

Got the car to the side of the road and my wife was calling AAA.  Just then, out of the blue Enrique Nava pulled up behind me in his truck (29-A).  He got out, we talked through the issue and he tried to jump the car, to no avail.  He said he wanted to see if charging for 15 minutes would do the trick.  Then AAA showed up.  I was impressed that he spent 15 minutes of unscheduled time to attempt to get me on my way. I didn't even know about the Metro program, but couldn't be more pleased.  Now if DMV workers could only take lessons on how to be accommodating AND nice to the public from Enrique/Metro, would really be great.  But, the only thing worse that TSA agents are DMV workers.  The opposite of TSA / DMV, Enrique.  Thx."

I have NO IDEA how they got the America's Best title. Have you ever actually tried to get anywhere via the Metro?Today, I left my house at 10am. I came home at 10pm. I spent 2 hours at my destination.It took me 5 hours of bullshit to get from the Valley to Torrance, both ways. One bus never came, the lady at 1-800-COMMUTE gave me the wrong bus number, the bus lady dropping me off in such a way that I'd have to pay the special freeway cost TWICE in once direction despite my day pass (What is the point of a $5 day pass if you are just gonna have to pay more anyway), and the web trip planner leaves a lot to be desired (Google, do it right before I get stranded too many more times).Anyway, there's a reason people drive in LA.

It sucks if you're stuck on it for more than an hour. I'm not going to take Metro from the South Bay to the SFV. For short hauls (i.e., thirty minute trips or less), it's not that big of a deal. The 704 (Santa Monica Blvd.) is great in terms of getting to Century City or Santa Monica. The 33/333 (Venice Blvd.) is great to get to the Venice Beach and the Promenade from Palms. Sitting on the bus with my iPod is much better than dealing with L.A. drivers, dealing with traffic, and looking for parking. When I was in college, my thought on taking the Wilshire buses was ""why take the bus when it can just take as long as driving your car?"" My thought now: ""why take your car when it can just take as long as riding the bus?"""

They are neglecting security on the train and need to be checking passes to see if some people even belong on it by checking to see if they paid, there are passengers annoying real riders, asking for money, selling crap or putting all their stuff on the seats when they likely haven't  paid to be on the train. I saw a rider threatening another rider. If someone says something on the intercom the drivers either can't hear them or they don't do anything. They broadcast a phone number to call if you see anything but there is no way to text this number, this is bad because what if someone doesn't want other passengers to know they are calling. People hang around on the platform and don't appear to be riders, I have seen people sleeping on benches, I saw one guy laying on the ground in front of a bench so no one could sit on it. They have all these cameras, why aren't they watching? I see all these cops standing around a Union Station when they need to be visible on the trains!

The system doesn't reach a lot of places in LA, and the scheduled arrivals have some wait time in between. I like the TAP cards, and rides are considerably cheaper than what I'm used to. I think that having agents walk around checking everyone's card is dumb, but to each their own. The trains are pretty consistent, and clean. I'd recommend adding half and hour or more to bus times. Don't rely on their tracking app. I was waiting on an 8:30pm bus to New Gardena. At 8:30, the bus's arrival time changed to 9:00. Then 10:00. Then 5:00am the next day. I saved myself the trouble and just called an Uber. The metro will kind of get you to where you need to be, just be ready to do a lot walking and a lot of waiting."

171,3 star rating,"May 1, 2011","LA is pretty large. I barely made a dent venturing into new neighborhoods while taking Metro. There are so many routes, that it can be quite confusing figuring which ones to take for the uneducated traveller.Without doing research, you would be better sticking to the Metro train lines, visiting the neighborhoods nearby and getting back on the Metro train to head elsewhere. Unfortunately, West LA is not served very well by Metro trains, so you would need to take buses to get there. And there lies the problem. Some routes take far too long. To save time, look for Metro Rapid Service buses to shave some time off. At least they have routes that have 24 hour service if you need it. You can't say that for many cities around the country.Bus fares are pretty reasonable though. $1.50 one-way, $6 for an all day fare. Much more affordable than King County Transit in my area and without a freaking Orca card to have to use.Compared with King County Transit, LA Metro is not that bad. Fares are reasonable and the system seems to go everywhere. You just need to plan ahead of time in getting around town so you don't waste your time on getting there as opposed to being where you want to be."

Currently the whole thing is basically one big honor system - which does mean that any joe average can just walk onto any train. In all my times I have been on the system, it has never shown me any enforcement of someone checking for proof of fare. If anything,t he metro system is just a bit on the lawless wild wild west side. It's like being in an unincorporated territory during the gold mining days. You didn't know when a hooplehead was going to come and try to lay claim to your... claim. Only for you to answer back with a buckshot to their face. What I'm trying to say with all these metaphors is that the Los Angeles Metro system is full of cocksuckers. But that doesn't mean you can't ride it. I certainly have never been flashed. Though I did once see someone squat in the corner... I'll let your imagination fill in the rest of the sad and terrifying picture. I do think that if they had turnstiles or even some means to enforce people paying for the fare, that they could get rid of a lot of the riffraff that is currently wandering about on these trains day in and day out. Also, could you NIMBY's stop being - as the folks of Deadwood would say, Cocksuckers. And just allow the construction around your area. South Pasadena did it, why can't you?

180,3 star rating,"Oct 10, 2011","Growing up in the Bay Area, I was fortunate enough to experience the awesomeness that is Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART). If it's going to an Oakland A's game or hitting up a show at Maritime Hall...BART was usually the way to go when it came to a non-driving option. LA's version of BART, the multifaceted LA Metro system holds some water when comparing the two public transit systems. Although that glass isn't too big when looking to fill it. I've taken Metro's Blue Line from Long Beach to LA / Hollywood quite a few times for several anti-war protests and most recently, Occupy LA at City Hall. I've never had a problem with Metro as a service itself. The act of transferring from the light rail Blue Line to the BART-like Red Line at 7th Street is really easy, even when my most recent experience included a portion of the Blue Line being shut down for some construction issues, Metro staff made the task of finding the shuttle bus and knowing where to go quite pleasant. I've also never really experienced any time delays with service either. Now if I relied on Metro to get to and from work, riding it daily, I might have a different opinion. With that being said, there are a few things I feel I must address. First of all, with the exception of a few LA Sheriff Officers patrolling stations (mainly making sure people have tickets), security seems a little sparse. Especially on the trains. Being how anyone can essentially ride Metro without a ticket...this leaves for people to take advantage of the situation. I think this is mainly as issue I've seen on the Blue Line. Let's not beat around the bush, the Blue Line goes through some pretty sketchy areas. This leads me to my next talking point...while there's a station right next to The Staples Center, I wouldn't take The Blue Line to a Laker's night game. Rolling through Compton at 11:30 PM doesn't sound like a good time to me. At least when I was on BART coming home from a show in San Francisco...I know that BART Police are on guard. Lastly, the idea that So. Cal doesn't have an area wide public transit system is quite sad. Nothing going into Orange County from LA County. They really need to expand Metro's service to neighboring counties and communities...like BART has in the Bay Area. Metro is a nice way to get into the LA / Hollywood area without driving...especially for day trips. Beyond that, unless you have more balls than I, it's ONLY for day trips. Otherwise it's a decent system."

A few years back, it took me about an hour and now it is only taking 20 minutes.  The Union Station area has cleaned up really well.  It can be pretty intimidating getting into Union Station with people bustling about.  Well a few days ago, there was the Salvation Army band playing Christmas songs and it was nice way of getting into the holiday spirit.  For the most part, people are pretty friendly, but you get some peculiar people who look like ex-cons or homeless who want to talk to you onboard, but that is something that is beyond Metro's control.And I agree with some of the bad reviews who make the claim there are no instructions on how to board or attendant helping out.  You'll have to do your research online on how to take it and through trial and error.  That is just how you learn and once you get used to it, it is a pretty convenient way of getting around."

Although the station is pretty and the hedges are trimmed and it has this manicured feel, the trains don't run very frequently (and are often late). Plus, it's about 6 bucks for a roundtrip ticket to Union Station. And it's hard if you take the train in during the day and want to stay later into the night (the last train back to Glendale on Saturday was at 9PM...Seriously!). There was an article in the LA times recently about taking the metro late night, well, 9PM is NOT late night people. No way. Still. I can wish, can't I? The Glendale station is within walking distance from my apartamento, so I really, really WANT to take the metro, but not if the trains run irregularly and the round trip ticket is more than three bucks. That's just silly. Still. I like public transportation. I really, really do. I'm not going to give up on LA's yet...I can only hope it will improve in the future. If I lived downtown; however, I would definitely take the metro to get where I want to go. From Union Station we took the red line to Pershing Square and it was pretty efficient."

I've taken the red line from Studio City to Hollywood a couple of times and the bus service that runs on Ventura and neither were bad or delayed. They were clean too. I've also taken the red line and purple line downtown. That was ok. However, the signs were lacking for direction at the Wilshire/Westlake station. I wasn't sure what platform to be on or which stairs to take to get to what train. I ended up following someone I overheard talking about what train they were taking. The buses are pretty straight forward. Pick a stop, read the map, trace your path to where you want to go, switch buses if needed. I haven't gotten the hang of the timing of the buses yet but I will. Easy to transfer to the trains too since the buses meet up with their stops. Also, the TAP card is nice in that you can just add money to it without buying a pass. The pass doesn't carry over each month but the straight money does."

The freeway fliers were okay, but local service was poor. SLOW in coming. Always TOO CROWDED. The perfect place to have your purse or pocket picked 3 times, and then some creep would try to cop a feel. Disgusting. Some of the drivers were rude and abusive.

Having grown up in Hong Kong, I'm more than familiar with train systems and how they work. For any L.A. visitor, all you'll need to navigate your way through the trains is a bit of research, possibly a smartphone/navigator or simply put that aside and grab a map and a compass and you're good to go! My parents and I opted to do things the old fashion way. We were on vacation and wanted to be away from technology as much as possible. We hopped on the gold and silver lines on the first day, tried the red and purple lines the next day and ended our vacation with the expo line to Culver City. All trains arrived promptly. Had a fun time at the purple line when this one guy got up his chair and called out to everyone else that he had a 'snoop doggy dog' song tucked under his sleeve. Without hesitation, he began to rap - to the annoyance of some commuters. I found it hilarious! He ended his song with a short speech about how he need some 'Mickey D's' and proceeded to ask for tips! We had to get off the next station just as he was about to start another Johnny Cash song. He ought to be doing that around Vegas, don't you think?"
195,2 star rating,"Oct 4, 2017",LA is too spread out so the metro doesn't go everywhere.  They are adding more lines so that is good.  If you want to take certain lines there's no parking and the lines that have parking available charge a fee.  Buying a round trip ticket is not clear on the screen.  You have to look up above over your head on the ticketing machine for some instructions and then look down at the screen.  This makes the line long as many people who don't ride it regularly don't know what to do.  Why not have all instructions on the screen where everyone is looking.  With time perhaps improvements will be made.

It will save you time and headache when getting around.The fact that you can get to major places WITHOUT a car in LA is pretty amazing. The only thing I absolutely hate is the friggin' gang-bangers and crazy bums/people riding. Hey!....stop looking at my pockets and shoes! No you can't steal them....I will kick your ass!

198,4 star rating,"Nov 17, 2014","We wanted to visit and stay in downtown LA to get a better feel for this nearby metropolitan area.In order to avoid driving (and parking) we decided to use public transport.We took the Amtrak from Irvine to Union Station.  We then used the Metro subway for much of our travel the next few days.I was pleasantly surprised (after reading some reviews).  After a small learning curve with the Tap system, we found our train which was better marked than other systems I have used (NYC, BART).  The subway was reasonably clean.  We had stops right across from our downtown hotel (the Sheraton) and where we wanted to mainly go (Hollywood & Highland).My only gripe was why they don't police if people are paying the fare?!?!?  We saw dozens of people easily walk right past the turnstiles without paying.  This added to crowded trains and, in my opinion, invited individuals who didn't care at all about their fellow riders.  My wife and I did get checked for tickets once...on our return trip to Union Station.  Enforce the fare and use the funds to maintain the cars, security and keep sufficient capacity.Otherwise I was very happy with LA's subway system."

Sum it up the route goes from decent to ghetto and back to decent. If you are a bbq fan this is a good ride to take especially the number of places i saw around leimert park with wacked out names i would expect a soul food joint to have. As for the jim crow situation you were better off sitting in the back of the bus since the air conditioning worked better.
201,3 star rating,"Jul 16, 2007","Having been spoiled by the BART and MUNI services of the Bay Area, one can easily be lulled into thinking ways to make it soo much better, or come up with small complaints.Take a weekend trip to LA......  wow...... we have it pretty good.  The Los Angeles area is definetly NOT pedestrian friendly, TAXIs will cost you more than almost anything else on your trip.  So on one of the days, we decide to use the Metro, as a way to snub our nose at the taxis fares.... until we realize that we have to take a taxi to the metro station from our hotel.... 10.00.  Then we arrive at a green line station... okay no problem, looks like our BART system...kik ass... until we go to buy tickets, of the 4 machines, none are working 100% as they will not take credit cards... although when working properly they do.  Its 1.25 to ride the system, cheaper than BART... hmmm maybe they have something here... up to the platform, no display to tell you how long to wait..... what seems like forever, a MUNI like train pulls up, which being near the endline is now almost full.  The trains are narrow and slow.  We ride that to the Blue line transfer, where we go down stairs into a very seedy neighborhood where we have to wait for the blue train under the overheard line of the green line..... not if you'll get mugged, but when....  the blue line pulls up, jam packed, and the BO smell is nauseating.  The train is slow, very slow... oh shit, get me off the thing, there are about 40 people on here, that have not showered in a week.  At the red line transfer, the system looks more like our Bart, as the train is longer to accommodate more people, but filthy..... the stench of the passengers is more tolerable, but you feel like you need a shower after the whole ride, and it takes so long, I don't know how anyone could use the system efficiently.  For a city so large, and in California, I was expecting more from it.  Website is very good for trip planning, so I will give them kudos for that.... but three stars, as they have mass transit, which is more than I can say for Detroit (other than bus and the peoplemover) but definitely not what you would expect for a city of its caliber."

Pershing Square is great too, its got a dirt cheap market and authentic mexican foods for cheapp. Its the best way to get around in LA. and for going out at night is great too becuase you can hope on from the NoHo station in the valley and get off at Hollywood and Vine and boom, youre smack in the center of all the action. (just remember winter hours last train runs at 12:13am, butttt in the summer it runs until 4am) plusssss it minimizes the risk of getting a DUI (i got one, take it form me, they suck so much i would give it 5 negative stars if i could yelp it)so yeaaa... no worries about traffic or parking prices, just quick and effecient."
206,3 star rating,"Aug 2, 2009","I've been using the MTA ever since arriving here some decade and a half ago from the east coast and I must say that the transportation system that they have here in the west coast is inferior to what they have in the east coast. In any case, not much can be helped. After a little over 15 years of riding the Metro, I can honestly say that many of the comments that were made by reviewers here are accurate. Buses: They never arrive on the time they are supposed to arrive so the timetables that you see on those pieces of paper? Don't rely on them. Use them as a guide. If it is says it'll arrive at 8:15am, it'll be plus or minus 30 minutes. So always arrive at least thirty minutes early from the time that the bus is ""supposed"" to arrive so that you don't miss it in case if it comes early--because the bus drivers don't give a rats ass if they are ""on schedule"" or not. Bus Drivers: A lot of the bus drivers don't know LA very much or the cities which their bus route is on. They only know the ""general"" bus route that they are supposed to go. That's it. If you're a newcomer to commuting by bus, you have a 50/50 chance that they can or cannot help you. And don't expect them to know which buses you need to transfer to once you get off the bus. A lot of them simply don't know, some don't really care, and the rest are just disgruntled bus drivers and they'll purposefully try to get you lost just because they had a bad day. I've had it happened to me too many times to remember in the 15 years I've been using the Metro. Also, if the bus driver doesn't see you at the stop, he or she will drive past it without stopping. So be visible at the stop and extend your arm out to signal to the bus driver that you want to board that bus. Metro Rail: Out of all the negatives I've pointed out so far, the rail has never disappointed me. They are generally quite consistent. They usually take something like 15-25 minutes to arrive at each station. You should get to the station at least 10 minutes early from the time the rail is supposed to arrive. Oh, and it's not unusual to find a few crackheads, hookers, hobos, drug dealers, and crazy people on board the rail at any given time. So if you're a female riding the train alone, I'd suggest standing or sitting near other regular people for your own safety and do carry plenty of pepper spray. Better yet, bring a stun gun. =DUnion Station: Don't use the restrooms in the main hall. If you have to go badly, use the restroom at the very back of the building after you past the hallway where all the trains are located at. That's probably the only restroom I know about that is remotely clean and not a lot of people use. The other ones at the main hall are a garbage dump--literally. Be prepared to smell a whiff of human fecal matter, trash, sewage, and other unpleasant smells. It's hobo heaven in there. Also, guard your belongings. Theft is common here. There are so many people coming in and out of this place that almost everyone appear as if they are running away from something. Oh, and if you're going to walk into the hallway where the trains are located at, be prepared because people there will literally elbow you or shove you out of their way to get to their destination. If you have to walk through there, walk fast in any single direction. All in all, if you don't have a car, or you're trying to save money, or if you just want to get from point A to point B and time isn't an important factor, then the Metro will do just that. Just don't expect great customer service, reliability, or consistency."

Appearanty they hired all these hearing personal just to give you a pity, pretend listening to you and understand your explanation..but then when i returned home, i still have to pay and in their letter it omit the fact that I had coins on hand but just mentioned it is my responsibility to pay before boarding on the bus.FUCK YOU metro, i have never be penalized like this.

Now as far as waiting for buses I always wait for the number 230 to go to Studio City its either on time or late one time it was 30 minutes late and I had to meet someone at a certain time but luckily my friend was understanding about the situation! And also please have more security at Metro Line Stations cause I have seen many many people not Tap there Tap Card nor pay for there fare and this happens quite a lot especially when you go to the Universal City Station everyone runs to the train without paying and its a shame to see that there's no one there to stop these people
210,1 star rating,"Jun 6, 2013","This company get one star for:Lack of security- surveillance cameras doesnt deter crime. Alot of weirdos board buses and trains to harass passengers. People who do not pay the fare can just walk right on through the turnstile since they are not locked, but its $250 fine if a person doesn't pay. As a matter of fact, I have seen people walk through the turnstile without paying and sheriff's deputies doesn't do anything.Lost and Found- This place doesn't have a direct number, it only has an online system to put your claim through  for them to find that item, and Metro tells you that they will contact you if they have found it. Well, I had lost my keys on the bus a few weeks ago and was never contacted. I had personally gone down there to the Metro center at Wilshire and La Brea to see if they had my keys and they did. This system just sucks."
211,4 star rating,"Dec 11, 2008","an underground railway system in a city notorious for earthquakes. i have got to meet the person who started the metro in la. that person has a wicked sense of humor. my first trip on the metro was the red line from hollywood and western to hollywood and vine. not a very significant distance but parking in hollywood is appalling on the weekend; so i figured why not give this a try. i was impressed at how clean the station was. probably because public transportation in la is an urban myth to most. but aside from the red line, the routes which the trains took don't appear to be all that conducive to traveling all over la. especially from areas north like pasadena to west la like santa monica. however, i'll still use the metro when i go to hollywood, heck of a lot less stressful than having to meander through tourist traffic and jockeying for ten dollar parking."
212,1 star rating,"Apr 15, 2016","Why do LA Metro hates their handicapped customers?.If you happen to be a handicapped or dissabled individual, and in need of using the LA Metro, please be aware of the following; LA Metro does not care about you. It does not matter that there are Federal regulations in place to allow the handicapped a modicum of safety and security as well as securement areas designated for the hansdicapped only. LA Metro, one of the largest public transportation providers in the Nation, does not care to inform nor to educate its riders and customers, about the needs of the dissabled. How difficult could it be to add a recorded message to remind people to be polite an to allow the spaces predesignated for the use of the handicapped only, to be use by the handicapped passengers. This is not to much to ask, unless you happen to be unfortunate enough to need to travel via LA Metro. They expect the handicapped to hold on tight for dear life, rather than institute an informational and educational program to emphasized the obvious needs of the handicapped. The LA Metro leadership needs to evolve and realise that we are now living in a 21st Century, and that we no longer hide the handicapped from plain view. We the dissabled,are not second class citicens, but LA Metro is providing a second class service."

The Metro is not in any way shape or form as impressive as mass transit back east, but for car crazy LA- its the little engine that could. I live 8 miles from my job, 15 min drive no traffic- but that never happens so I go metro 5 days a week to save $, time, and sanity. The red line connects North Hollywood (and the valley via easy transfer to the Orange Line) Hollywood, & Koreatown to DTLA. It's a no brainier to sitting on the 101 in traffic, especially with ample parking in North Hollywood. The trains run every 10 mins during the day and have space in each car for bikes. Although the red line runs underground, most of the stations are wheelchair accessible.During the morning and early evening commutes, the train is full but with professional/working/students type. The evening hours get a little 'colorful' depending what station (7th & Metro and Pershing Square.....can get creepy) I took a star off for minimal security and lack of patrols. Although, I would advise against trying to get a free ride, the sheriffs dept is frequently out checking tickets or TAP cards- a $150+ fine and a trip in handcuffs is NOT worth it.Bonus points for being inexpensive ($1.50 per ride, $5 day pass) and for a lot of employers reimbursing for a monthly TAP pass. Plus i can listen to podcasts, music or just zone out on my commute vs being frustrated at the wealth of idiots with a drivers license. As far as I'm concerned, the metro is a good way to go!"

There are still too many hustlers on the Metro Rail cars( those running shell and card games who solicit illegal bets) or just plain setting up shop selling who knows what in the train cars.

Blame this on my sociology major, but I am a people fanatic! My obsession with observing the folk has lead me to a passionate love for the Los Angeles Metro. The movie Crash made it clear that the Los Angeles driving population is lonely. The hours I spend in my car each day are void of any human interaction. The Los Angeles Metro system has restored my faith in human connection! The metro is slow, and its stops are limited, but it is a chance to talk to fellow humans. Over the course of my few metro rides I have had a number of riveting conversations and exchanges. The last time I rode an older woman and I together stared fearfully at an abandoned bag for the course of our entire ride. We chatted amiably about the possibility of a bomb exploding in the train and burning us to bits. We giggled the whole way! I imaging you could meet your true love on the metro. Why go to clubs or coffee shops when your future mate could be with you on your ride home from work. I only wish I could ride the metro more, but unfortunately it does not yet come out to the westside."
221,1 star rating,"Jul 26, 2012","I did not start taking the Metro until 2008. Not surprisingly, I'm now officially over it.Beginning in 2010, I started taking Metro buses and Rail everywhere since I didn't have a license and I began going to college. I pretty much am on MTA every single day. All I have to say to summarize my experiences: varied and inconsistent. Sometimes buses come too early or too late. I've had times when I was just across the street or down from an arrival and they left even though the listings cited they were not coming for another 5 minutes. Then there are some buses that can be as late as 20 minutes or don't show up at all.Twice a bus driver snapped at me, ""What does that mean? I don't understand."" because I told them I didn't have enough change. Well yes, this isn't a special needs class. I mean what I say. The policy of exact change is annoying. I've either put in too much or too little a handful of times. They need a change machine or something.Some drivers are bitchy, some are rude, some are kind, some are happy. You never know what you're going to get. I've had drivers that were maps of the area, and others that wouldn't even answer me. I'm paying you... do your job right. I asked one if they got interviews and training and he said yes. Another said they just get so bored doing the same thing over and over. Actually, your job is easier than many others... you operate a ride for everybody even though it does get old.Also, I heard that many drivers drive way too fast. Often, handicapped people fall out of the weak straps. When I was younger I noticed the bus did not offer better securement, which did prove to be a problem. No seat belts. One time I was on Hollywood and Western and one elderly man actually fell because the driver sped away when he was trying to sit down. The top of his head cracked open and bled, driver wasn't allowed to drive for some time, and an ambulance came while we all got on another bus. Everyone talked about lawsuits.Anybody can ride a bus or train, and that includes homeless people. Not specific to LA but a lot of people have mental issues and don't drive. Yep, you'll see them on here. Drivers aren't allowed to kick them off since they scrape up the greens (only $1.50) or they beg their way in. Don't be surprised if you see people asking you out or asking for money during your ride. Disturbing? Distracting? Yeah, I know.Everyone screaming that Metro helps combat traffic, not really. Some parts of Koreatown, Downtown, and West LA are still pretty bad especially after the mornings. Appointments become more of a problem. I am in no way biased, I have friends who live in DTLA and Pasadena and they rely soly on the Metro system to get around. If you're lucky enough to have such systems closer to you, you can get anywhere in under 20 minutes. The only good thing is that this gets you to places and you don't have to park."

It does run less than the others though, good luck catching an eastbound bus after 7 pm and a westbound bus after 9 pm...Line 4 is a mix of Latino workers who staff most of downtown santa monica and a huge number of homeless and druggies. Most of the UCLA/young professional types go on Big Blue Bus, so Line 4 is a little rough. Once you get to WeHo more gays and trannies come on. Plus some Silverlake alterative types. Late at night Line 4 is literally a homeless shelter on wheels. This is the most consistent owl service bus too, it keeps a 20 minute schedule even at 2 or 3 am.Line 20 along Wilshire is the worst. Far too overcrowded all the time. Wilshire Blvd passes through the densest parts of LA, and all kinds of people are on this bus. Workers, students, homeless, professionals, housekeepers. You'll have trouble getting a seat unless you get on the first couple stops.LA Public transport is not too good, but I'm OKAY with it because it's cheap and accessible,t hough highly unreliable.If you work a typical rush hour job (somewhere around 9-5) I would NOT rely on the bus. There are far too many inconsistencies with timing, seating, traffic, bizarre operator behavior where you can't expect to get to work on time unless you plan super early.If you are on a leisurely visit or have time to kill, the bus is a great way to get around, especially if you catch a Rapid (starts with 700) since they only go to major intersections.The majority of bus riders are homeless at night. They keep to themselves, but if you are disturbed by ranting and yelling, getting up and wandering around the bus, and awful smells, you might not like the bus.Also a lot of crack and meth addicts ride it during the day and talk to themselves.So ultimately if you have time to kill (or get to a stop way before you're supposed to) and don't mind hangin with the homeless 2 feet away with you the bus is a viable option. I'd only use it for leisurely experiences -. Too unreliable for work, even the worst traffic jam in a car is gonna beat the bus.EDIT: If you have a smartphone, get one of the apps like TransitLA or ""Where is my LA Metro Bus"" because they GPS track the buses. For the most part they have been accurate down to the minute (unless a bus driver effs up and ditches). If you have to be somewhere, you can pretty well rely on this tracker."

A driver in particular would not give me any indication on which bus stop I needed to get off at. He kept saying that he didn't know and he didn't care at all and what's worse he dropped me in the middle of nowhere saying he didn't know where else to stop."

On the pro side, you get where you need to go at a lower cost,they keep expanding so more routes to go more places and the trains kick a**. You can go all over LA with one or two TAPS of your card. On the con side are alot of the drivers have major tude,you have to deal with psychos getting on the bus/train,since most rails go by honor system you have to deal with sheriff checks from time to time. They board or are already on the train and they walk down the aisles asking to see your card and they scan it to see if you paid your fare. They always get someone for ridin dirty and it funny to see the rider put up a fight and say it was an accident or they forgot to TAP/pay the fare. Use Metro.net and you are set! I'm thankful for the system right now because these gas prices are something else!"

I have so many stories to tell. But yeah, metro is the best way to get around and is full of surprises. I feel like I'm going on an adventure every time I ride a bus. Thank you Metro bus drivers for taking me here and there all my life hahaha. :)"

233,3 star rating,"Jul 13, 2012","I would say that I don't know why more people don't utilize the LA Metro system but prior to using it for the first time about a year and a half ago I never used it because I just never even thought about it. I'm usually traveling with other people and just always assume we're driving but last year I was attending a outdoor concert a few miles south east of downtown LA and when we realized it would be impossible and extremely expensive to park there we decided to take the Metro from another station past downtown. We drove and met up with our friends at their hotel by a station, each paid a low fee and road the train in from there. Very easy and not at all unpleasant. Much cheaper than driving, less stressful and honestly I think we saved time because we didn't sit in any of the bumper to bumper traffic waiting to park and what not. Exiting was a little more crowded but efficient. Like I said, I just never even thought about using the LA metro but now that I have I usually use it every opportunity that I can. Especially if you're going out with your friends and might be drinking so you don't can't drive...much cheaper than a taxi. Something we should all start using more often."
234,4 star rating,"Jul 27, 2007","Not sure if this is the correct listing for the entire LA Metro system as the address listed is in Chinatown but this seems to be the closest I'm going to get.  To those of you used to the public transport systems of NY, the two don't really compare.  LA is a huge city and not meant to be traversed on foot like NY is.   However, I do find it handy when traveling to places like Hollywood and Highland or to the Pantages. While I wish there were more Metro stops (i.e. along the Westside), they do have enough to enable me to take it about once or twice a week up to LA since I have a stop near my workplace.  One complaint that I do have is that they don't run as frequently as I would like them to, especially at night.  They've raised prices recently for the All-Day Pass, which used to be $3 but now is $5.  Each one-way is $1.25.  I don't suggest riding without a ticket, although they don't check most of the time.  However, when they do check, they often do it by the exits, esp. at the Hollywood/Vine and Hollywood/Highland stops.  It's a pretty steep fee if you're caught: $250 fine and I think 200 hours of community service.  And if you don't have proper ID with you, they'll handcuff you and take you to the station -- I've seen this happen plenty of times.  I've ridden it late at night, which I don't really recommend bc the trains are fairly empty, but nothing has happened to me....yet.  I definitely recommend taking the Metro when you have the chance!  It's saved me money and, once in a while, time - it's faster than driving through all that LA traffic."
235,1 star rating,"Jul 8, 2012","I've used public transportation in Los Angeles for about 6 years now and I'll still say it sucks. Yeah using it will save you gas money but then again trains/buses are so slow and for a trip that's usually 45 minutes by car it will take you 2 hours or more to get to your destination. To top it off, most bus drivers are so rude, especially if you're on the orange line. I've seen them shut the door on people so many times and they'll be right outside the door too.. I just don't see how they can be so rude. If it weren't for the people using the bus they wouldn't have their job so they should be more polite and professional. I've used the Blue Line, Red Line, and Green Line, and so far the Blue Line is the only one I'll say that's horrible. It's usually always dirty and smells bad. A lot of the seats are broken too. Last thing I'll mention is that there are times when you'll be on any Metro bus and out of nowhere in the middle of your bus ride the driver decides to take a break so you gotta be waiting for them and then your bus ride will continue. If anything they should take a break before or after the bus ride instead of making people late. With that said, I only give one start to LA Metro because it's gotten me to places but it doesn't deserve any more stars because it's service is horrible."

Here's some advice: if you live LA, get a car. Simple. Yeah, the traffic and the parking sucks, but what's the alternative?"
237,4 star rating,"Aug 19, 2013","I am a teenager and I ride this bus everytime to go to school. This bus starts from Hollywood and Vine all the way to La Cienega and Jefferson Station. Sometimes, the 217 can go all the way down to Culver City Transit Center, which is around Centinela and Sepulveda. All the bus drivers I met are very nice, although traffic between Fairfax and Wilshire to Fairfax and Pico can be a bit iffy. I am still a big fan of line 217 and it is one of the best lines ever."
