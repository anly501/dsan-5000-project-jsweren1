3,4 star rating,"Jan 7, 2023","I refuse to compare the Chicago ""L"" to the New York City subway. I will not. To do that is literally comparing an apple to an orange and that simply is not fair.What I will do is praise the heck out of this system. It is clean, safe, reliable, and extensive. Those are my only similarities between the ""L"" and the subway. After that, things vary, and not just because most of the system is above ground, hence the ""L"" nickname.I found most people on the trains respectful. Not many panhandlers, and the rule about no bikes on the trains during peak hours is strictly enforced. I was on a train where a cyclist tried boarding with a bike and the motorman announced ""No bikes during rush hour."" To enforce this, the train would not move until the cyclist disembarked. That would never happen in New York City.Once you get the hang of it, navigating around the Loop is rather easy and fun. There are plenty of lines to pick from, and they all pretty much get you where you need to go downtown. Once they branch off the loop, some of the lines run express outside downtown, making it even easier to get around.From a railfans' perspective, it is an absolute delight. I found a parking garage that overlooks Tower 18 and you could easily spend several hours watching trains traverse this intersection. It is like watching vehicle traffic as trains stop to allow other trains to pass by or merge onto another track. Sometimes you can see up to four trains come together! It felt like a model train display being brought to life.I could also talk about METRA, but that is for another review."
4,1 star rating,"Oct 20, 2023",Reading these reviews I had to throw in my thoughts. I would say 90percent of CTA employees are rude and lazy. Ridiculous.  If you have a complaint call the station directly and ask for a Manager. (You can find the numbers by looking at the Lost and Found numbers on their website). To the person who said white neighborhoods get quicker service..no..all neighborhoods have terrible service..partially due to them being understaffed. And to the person in O.P. saying the homeless are along the tracks? You must mean outside the tracks. That's not CTA property. Sadly seeing homeless in big cities and nearby burbs comes with territory. I noticed you have another review complaining about the homeless..maybe a major urban area is not for you. Just sayin.â€‹
5,4 star rating,"Mar 5, 2023","Coming from a big city with a shitty transit system, it's hard to judge CTA harshly. The only reason I'm on here is to express my pleasure with the staff working the morning of March 1 at the Merchandise Mart station. She was fan-f*cking-tastic! We couldn't figure out the machine and she didn't think twice about coming over and helping us. Then she shared a trick with the zip code for out of towners, and told us to not use our debit card while were in the city. Loved her and she kicked off what turned out to be a great day on the L.Dropped a star because waiting 20 minutes for a train feels weird coming from a city where a train comes every 2-5 minutes."
6,1 star rating,"Apr 13, 2023","CTA is just as racist as the rest of AMERIKKKA! Service is RIDICULOUS in the Black neighborhoods!White people in the more affluent communities don't have to wait 20 and 25 mins for a bus DURING RUSH HOUR! You charge like passengers get door to door service and most of the time you people don't clean the bus stops from snow and ice! You suck but at least you are consistent, you've always sucked! During this pandemic I haven't seen ONE power washer on the L platforms and then you have the nerve to say you are deep cleaning!And whoever  decided to change some stuff f these bus stops apparently never had to catch the bus on a regular basis in their lives! You shouldn't have to walk a half of a block to get to your connecting bus stop! CTA YOU REALLY REALLYSUCK!!!"
7,2 star rating,"Jul 14, 2023","Never ask any of the employees ANY TYPE OF QUESTIONS because their responses will be rude as hell. Just absolutely rude. I don't normally say I strongly dislike strangers but some of these employees are so rude and in the worst moments too, when you're struggling to find your way in the city they are not the folks to help you out and just will make you feel bad for not knowing the city and the transit system...this sounds mean but I've tried to be so nice for 5 plus years about the cta and i am about through"

I would much rather ride new york transit and thats saying A LOT. whether i come extra early, or just on time for a train they are NEVER ON TIME. I have had to relocate my gd job because of this. RIDICULOUS AND SHIT TRANSPORT. youd be better off paying a local to piggy back you all the way to downtown."
12,1 star rating,"May 6, 2023","For commuters who rely on the trains outside of peak periods, avoid at all costs. Train arrival times are falsely advertised so that you pay the fare believing a train arrives in 5 minutes, only for that train to mysteriously disappear and have the next one arriving in 30 minutes. This also creates long waits at night in subway where crime frequently occurs. Because of this I will be relocating close to work to avoid any future reliance on the CTA. Use at your own risk!"
13,5 star rating,"Oct 25, 2021","This review is for the CTA BUS-Chicago Avenue LOST & FOUND..Have you ever left personal items on the CTA BUS and wondered how to find out if your ""lost items""  were in fact ""found""?I went on a Sunday Journey to Crate & Barrel to buy a few small culinary items.....then went to get groceries before taking the 72 Bus back home.It was in the afternoon and raining and only myself and another person were on the bus and we both got off at the same stop.Unfortunately, I forgot my Boxed Up Crate & Barrel Culinary Purchases on the seat directly behind the rear exit door.BUMMER!I got on-line to research how to see if there is a CTA BUS LOST AND FOUND.YES...YES...YES!The direct number is: (773) 638-3083Prompt #2 directly connects you to a ""human being!""I called immediately after I got home and the Lost and Found Attendant said to call back later as the bus driver/bus was probably still out on ""the job.""SO I WAITED and CALLED BACK THE NEXT DAY-Someone who said ""Lopez"" answered and listened to my inquiry on my Crate & Barrel Box ""Lost items"" and then checked and said that the box HAD NOT BEEN TURNED IN...aka the items were still ""LOST!""I thanked him and hoped that someone else was enjoying my condiment bowl,  4 appetizer plates, a festive pumpkin dish towel, and hanging Christmas Tree Cut Out.Lopez said that he would take my number and call if indeed it was turned in to the Lost and Found CTA BUS Department.  Very thoughtful and it is nice to actually know that people DO CARE...even about small things...THANK YOU CTA LOST AND FOUND!5 STARS for the Professionalism and Caring Spirit and for even having a Lost and Found that is staffed by ""real"" Chicagoans who try to help make the world a better place!"

17,2 star rating,"Jan 24, 2022","The CTA can do a better job at not succumbing to the mandates given by whom ever regarding the mask mandates. I have also been to the 79th train station recently and it looked as if the tracks hadn't been cleaned in months. So let's keep the tracks clean. Also, it's literally a snow day on 1/24/2022 and the Wallace bus normally sits at the stop for a few minutes and today they decided not to wait. They also did not take initiative to get the fallen crossing signs fixed by IDOT for the customers crossing from the other side of the street. There's a lot of room for improvement. Still grateful that he city has the public transportation we have, just gotta make sure we don't spend billions on one train stop (Washington and Wabash) and forget about everything else that needs to be taken care of.9:54am update: spoke to Randall in CTA customer service and seems as though he was bothered I had complaints about CTA. He ignored some things I mentioned and also interrupted me while in the middle of speaking. Also, the cover stickers on the glass windows  in the orange line halsted station need to be removed so customers can clearly see when the buses are arriving."
18,4 star rating,"Sep 26, 2021","Took the train from Midway airport to downtown Chicago. The station is a ground level station and on the Orange Line. There is indoor and sheltered bike parking available. This is also a bus stop. The $10 1-day CTA fare pass is affordable and you get to ride as many times as you want in a day. The ticket machines are easy to operate and if you take your time and follow the instructions it is not complicated. I had a little trouble with entering the terminal as I didn't see the sign change on the display on the turnstile. So I had to be let in by the agent. I'm a hot mess. The train was already waiting so we got on board. There are maps on the top so you can see the different stations and find the one you need. The ride was smooth for the most part and it was not crowded both times we rode. The train is on a platform downtown and it was strange to ride between buildings and be able to look into someone's room since we were so close. It feels like the buildings press against the train. When we got out, we made our way through the turnstile and down to the street. On the return, we found a station and took the stairs up and went through the turnstiles. There are elevators if you need. And the signage tells you which side of the platform you need to be on depending on your route. It's actually pretty easy compared to other train systems I've ridden on. They announce the stations where you can transfer to another line at so that's convenient."

23,2 star rating,"Dec 23, 2022","The CTA gets 2 stars instead of 1 because I find the 76 and brown lines relatively clean; I also appreciate the low fares. The scheduling, however, is completely unpredictable and unacceptable. The Ventra app provides up-to-date information on the arrival of buses/trains, but it's notably wrong the majority of the time. I understand traffic, weather, and personnel issues that affect transit times by a few minutes, however, about half the time the bus never shows. Today, this occurred while I was standing in -30 wind chill. The bus never arrived when ""due,"" and the app updated to show the next bus coming 15-20 minutes later. This is a repeatable occurrence. As an environmentalist, and as someone who believes in public transit, I wish CTA would just get it together. I'm not sure how anyone could depend on them for work transit."

30,4 star rating,"Aug 19, 2021","Fast and often. CTA did a pretty job of getting us around the Windy City. Their multi-modal- they have trains and buses. You can use your Ventra card on all of them. I ended up caving and getting the Ventra app, which links up to your credit card, so you don't have to handle tickets and the machine being out of order. It's great once you get it set up. It took some practice to get down how to position my phone on the card reader. You use the phone to draft your account! The buses were swift, with lots of stops nearby. I was disappointed that many of the stations in the loop don't have wheelchair access. You gotta plan ahead if you have a wheelchair or something. The ADA wheelchair icon can be found on many, but not all the stations on the map. I got chewed out by one bus driver for not announcing getting off the bus fast enough. But that was on me. If you miss one bus, there's another one coming shortly, or another one nearby that'll come get you. It sure beats driving in this town."

32,4 star rating,"Sep 8, 2021","CTA exceeds my expectations.They're not perfect, but no transit system is.Here's what I like:Drivers and staff are friendly and helpful. They might be direct and talk loudly to be heard, but they are helping you with good intentions. I've had overwhelmingly great experiences with almost everyone.The system has a long history and the routes have worked themselves out mostly well. Things tend to run often.There's at least one rock band named after them. (Chicago, formerly Chicago Transit Authority, which was too long for rock and rollers, who were into the whole brevity thing)What I don't like:Random and unexplained delays, too often.Train cars aren't patrolled. People will beg for money, sometimes aggressively. Other situations might arise where you're on your own.In summary, quit driving and start bussing and training. Not training... L-ing, I mean.. Or uhh, take the train, that is!"

34,5 star rating,"Sep 24, 2021","I write this review to highlight the extraordinary service of three CTA train operators. Firstly I mention Barron of the Purple Line Express. His rides are experiences. I feel as though I am being transported on the Disneyland Monorail. The ride is smooth and precise, allowing me to enjoy the sights of Chicago. Barron is friendly and respectful. I have dubbed his run as ""The Barron Express."" Secondly I mention Cynthia of the Brown Line. The energy and cheer that she provides is out of this world. I think that she was born of another planet! Thirdly I mention Kevin of the Brown Line. He is a hunk who operates skillfully and kindly. I am grateful to these divine humans who take me where I need to go! Oh, and I love the CTA so muchly that I don a CTA hat in the wintertime (see picture). Thank you, CTA!"
35,1 star rating,"Dec 13, 2021","I was taking a friend from Florida all around the city and he was excited to ride the CTA and we bought a single ride pass which we is suppose to give you two transfers within two hours. Well every time we tried too use the transfers well within two hours it would not let us through saying it expired!!!!Plus we kept seeing smelly people sleeping all over the trains or people smoking several times or people rapping loudly a few times or yelling!Suddenly his excitement for the CTA and us riding it for 3 weeks went away as we could not count on it and it seemed silly to have to keep spending 3 dollars to get back on the trains and buses after only one hour especially when it claims you have two hours in which to use two transfers! And to do so with the sleeping, smoking, rapping, etc we kept encountering!On top of all of that there are always people bugging me for MY money and not taking no for an answer and people blaring their crap music.If the CTA is going to announce that things like talking on the phone, radio playing and smoking and demanding my money is not allowed then they need to enforce those rules! Â As every single time I am on the CTA someone is on the phone being loud, playing music loud and always demanding I give them money and all the other things mentioned!Even now with new reduced fares which is great!  But due to all of the above I am not so anxious to take advantage of it sadly. The CTA like the rest of the city cannot control the endless bad pathetic behavior of so many in this city!"

It's not quite as extensive as the New York System but it does work. There aren't really ways to get from one end of town to another in such a speedy way as the subway in New York City, and London also has a better subway system than anything on offer in Chicago. Having said that it's a lot better than some places. Los Angeles, Washington DC, I'm looking at you.Having said all that you have to say the elevated train is pretty amazing. But then so is your mother's body considering her age."
37,3 star rating,"Feb 17, 2020","For tourists, this is a passable way for getting around the city, especially if you are staying in the downtown Loop area. There are many stops that are close by all the famous attractions. However, for such a big city, I was surprised that the trains do not come more often. It was normal to wait at least 10 minutes for the next train. Also, there is a good amount of homeless people sleeping on the trains, with some cars smelling so bad, it was impossible to stay in them. Speaking of cleanliness, it did not appear that these trains are cleaned much, as the inside of most of them had plenty of wear and stains."

I was beyond pissed off! My grandpa is 60 years old and still managed to get to the stop with time to spare only to be disrespected like that with about 5 bags in each hand! I definitely reported the incident! Very disrespectful!!!

43,3 star rating,"Feb 6, 2019","The CTA and I have what I would call a love, hate relationship. When it's running smoothly and I happen to catch a good cart on the train, I'm the definition of a happy camper. Those days when everything is delayed and the cart smells so bad I almost get sick, I curse to the high heavens and dream of teleportation. I'm about to get really real here. You ready?Also, heads up. I must point out that the majority of my experience utilizing the CTA is with the train system, most particularly the Blue Line. While I've ridden other lines and the bus a number of times, I lived off the Blue Line for about three years and knew it pretty well. The upside - I love that the CTA has an app and that you can use to add value to your transit card while on the go. The machines they have at each stop are fine and fairly easy to use but using the app is the most convenient. The app will also tell you about arrivals, delays, etc. Their operators are real humans. They have bad days but they also good days, like the rest of us. If you're lucky you'll get a super friendly or even a singing operator. It always brightened my morning and I want to give that specific fella a shout out. I don't know if you're still there but you're awesome. The downside - Depending on the line you ride, the carts and the train itself can be outdated. The Blue Line specifically seems to be a really outdated. It always has less room and is visibly older than others, like the Red Line. The Blue Line is also one of the only 24-hour trains and while that may seem like a perk, be mindful of the time that you're riding it. You'll have folks keeping cover over night when the weather is bad or when they have no place else to go. Pro tip - If you're around during the holidays try and catch the holiday train. It's cute. Solid three stars CTA, thanks for your service."
44,1 star rating,"Jun 13, 2022",CTA is the worse run public transportation in the country!  It's loaded with homeless and drug addict's.  If taking to ORD in the morning hours it can take up to a hour to go three stops.  That doesn't include homeless jumping on the tracks to delay the trains.  Medical emergencies happen a few time a week which delay the passengers and ORD worker's to be late for flights and lose time from work!  This has been happening for at least 2 years! If you have to get to ORD take a UBER and save yourself a miserable trip

50,4 star rating,"Mar 8, 2018","I queried enough pedestrians as to locating the stop for the CTA60 bus to await it's arrival, nobody had a clue. Friendly as they were, how can there be such a disconnect between machine and man? So, the bus driver proceeds to inform me that he ""wazzint no toor guide"" and to step back from the yellow line. Fortunately for the overweight Martin Lawrence look alike, I use words for good -- not for evil.I was on the phone a second later with the CTA's customer care supervisor, bus ID number in hand. I'd love to use her actual name for her to receive true credit, but I'll not. She was apologetic and remedied my issue after two return calls totalling fifty well spent minutes.The buses themselves were in clean and quietly running condition. An atrium-ish effect, outside light was being send down and through the large windows upon the passengers. Each seat had contours dipping and curving suggesting a snug, well fitting squat -- and I must say that it works --- having had a fourty minute test ride."

Seeing so many negative things here about Ventra, the CTA and such all I can say is the citizens of Chicago that are customers of the CTA and Ventra... as bad as you think you have it be happy you don't have to rely on the TTC.I like the CTA and I'll tell you why:-The CTA is NOT the most expensive city transit to use in North America (Toronto is based on cost of passes, basically the foundation of your ridership)-The CTA doesn't get ripped off by fares in a sense of having an automatic payment system whether Ventra or Tap and Pay using your own bank/debit/credit card etc.-The CTA has 2 x 24 hours subway lines (red and blue)-The CTA has 2 airports served by CTA rail system (in Toronto we don't even have one TTC train service our main airport and the other airport is on an island)-The CTA has a wide rail coverage system over a vast area in 2 subway lines and 4 to 6 elevated lines depending on how you want to count the Brown/Purple/Red/Yellow extensions in the North.-The CTA has a lower ridership than Toronto but about double the quantity of rapid transit (subway/elevated train) stations than Toronto and can charge LESS to operate the system.My wife and I spent the last 5 days in Chicago and were either walking or using the CTA and over the entire 5 days because we bought 7 days passes it cost us a combined 56 dollars in CTA fares using Ventra.  This included a ride back and forth from O'Hare airport multiple bus rides all over, the L etc.  One cab ride from O'Hare to Magnificent Mile would have cost more than 56 dollars.  The CTA is convenient, easy to learn, easy to use and quick service while being affordable and feasible to use as opposed to taxis, Uber etc."

Hey we the taxpayers are instrumental in keeping the service operating so if I ask a question related to the service and I'm not being a total schmuck about it, don't tell me to sit down and shut up.Me- do you realize it does not say 157 but ' out of service'driver: get on the bus man, dont you see its running? ( loud voice)seriously:)Some of the train stations are not safe.The Morse and Howard stops are devoid of cops or cta police and you can get accosted or mugged there at any time of the day or night by vagrants, drug addicts, drug dealers, pimps, hookers, thieves, con artists. Ah yes the joys of the city. Also don't ride the red line during a cubs game either way. You will find out real fast if the person next to you is wearing deodorant, aftershave, has drunk bad banaca. Something has got to be done to ease pact lines during those times. This is my rant."

Most people track the bus so they won't get killed while waiting for the bus. And a lot of people use it to get to work on time......"
58,1 star rating,"Jul 9, 2022","Covid can't be forever a blanket excuse. The #6 bus, notorious for being late, ghosting, etc, broke a new record today. Between 5:05pm and 6:15pm there wasn't a single bus. That's the bus closest to me, with other routes requiring I take multiple buses. There weren't any buses even appearing on the bus tracker until 6:15, and that one was listed as 28min away. I tried to catch the closest alternative to my destination but that one also had a 27min wait. I finally took the long route, via train and a connecting bus - and yes, that connecting bus was a 21min wait. When I boarded the bus, fully a third of the people were griping about how they had to take this alternative because the #6 never came. Damned shame. This is not just a complaint about a slow bus, this is an egregious slap in the face of south side travelers in the Hyde Park district. The #6 has an unsavory reputation for not showing, ghosting, and for afternoon (3-4pm), evening (8-9pm), nighttime and early morning ghosting. The bus schedules are on a fictional level with Tolkein. Every trip can't end or begin with having to take a taxi or uber because CTA plans stoppages during the day."

But whenever I rode it, both the L and the buses, it got me right where I needed to go, quickly and without incident. I thought the service was pretty damn good; I was visiting for four days and didn't get in a car once. Visiting Europeans or residents of East Asia might beg to differ, and sure, it's not London or Paris or Hong Kong or Tokyo or Seoul. But the coverage, in and of itself, is pretty good. If you want truly world-class public transportation, your options are New York and D.C. For the rest of us, CTA gets the job done.I don't know how it was before, by the way, but the Ventra Card makes it a breeze."

I'm not sure if early day service is affected the same? Earlier this year while the pandemic was still raging, a driver told me many drivers weren't reporting to work. Which left me waiting for two or three scheduled buses that didn't show up. AGAIN...just this past week (10/26?) I waited over an hour for a bus at Irving Park Rd and Cicero. Then when one finally showed up, the driver had no idea why the others were no shows. How can they not be aware of what is going on, on the routes they drive??? It was more tolerable during warm weather but how do you expect people to wait in the freezing cold like that!?? And what about people who are relying on this bus to get to work? There has been more than enough time to correct this problem."

Some cars are cleaner than others, but what do you expect? It's public transit after all. This system is my favorite after NYC. If you're flying into O'Hare or Midway, there are subway lines that will take you to downtown at cheap price. Best way to traveling in the Windy City."
67,4 star rating,"Sep 8, 2008","My brief experience with the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) reminded me of NYC's MTA in format, availability, and efficiency. The staff I interacted with were professional and got me where I needed to be.The CTA is convenient if you happen to live or work near a stop (if you don't have a car, they're kind of necessary). We took the Metro, via the Blue Line, both to and from O'Hare. While in town, we bussed from Navy Pier to a stop near our hotel. On the way home, I had to take a detour, ending up on a CTA shuttle for a bit. (Of course, when the CTA isn't available, one can always hail a taxi, especially if out late.)Besides being very confused with how to pay for their Metro cards (uh, don't ask), we got ourselves three-day passes, perfect for weekends and worth it for out-of-towners, especially since they can pay for rail AND bus service. Give them a try if you've never!"
68,3 star rating,"Oct 27, 2012","Magneto strikes (my wallet) again! My CTA Plus Card got demagnetized. For weeks I would play roulette getting on my bus (usually after all other riders) and the train, hoping my card would ""take"" after a few swipes on my pants leg (ancient bus driver's secret) or wool coat. The card finally failed, and so I easily deactivated it online.Once you deactivate, you can immediately pick up a new card! The CTA Sales Center is on the 2nd floor of their building on Lake, and there are a few computers right up there that you can access your account information, if you need. There are a few people working Customer Service who are nice, and the Sales Center is where you get your new card.They also have a Lost and Found for items lost on the CTA. (Wow, novel idea!) So if say, you find someone's wallet, take it here and let CTA handle it! I'm sure the person that lost it will appreciate your honesty, and will call CTA to retrieve it with all of its contents still intact.I'm sure service at the Sales center depends on whoever's working, similar to the DMV. My wait at 1:30pm was only 15 minutes and my time at the window picking up my new card took less than a minute. My new card was FREE. It happened so fast, I was wary that the lady had tied my new card to my monthly account, but she did! Easy Peasy! Don't hate! Appreciate!"

Before heading to the train platform at O'Hare, we purchased a 7-day Ventra Pass for $28. For unlimited rides on the L and buses, it is an awesome deal! Though a new card costs $5, it is also a memento for the trip (like my Pasmo card from Tokyo)! I imagine that I will just load up the card again on my next trip to Chicago! The train cars for the system are well maintained and really clean (can't say that about BART)! It is awesome that CTA can get you all around town in a fairly quick and economical way.

This morning August 30, 2020 at a approximately 9:43 a.m. the 53 bus (8132) on Pulaski going south bound passed me right by as I stood with 2 other potential passengers. I am 61 and disabled and one of the other people was on a walker. This is the main reason why I am complaining. We all stood on Van Buren and Pulaski. High crime, high drug invested area. Murders have increased over the last few months in this area. Nonetheless, this driver cruised right by us like it was nothing. I could not believe my eyes. There were literally 7-10 passengers on this bus. I chased the bus to Congress and Pulaski a block away,  and this driver looked me dead in my eyes embarrassingly with a gesture (IM FULL). I was livid to say the least and the people standing on the Pulaski Blue line L station saw it all. With the many corono virus scams this over weight bus driver came to work to drive up and down the street and collect a pay check. Not aware of the many dangers he had left us in. Since the CTA have cameras for crimes. Roll your video back. My time is pretty accurate. To help you even more. The following bus stopped for us all. Bus #53 (4103) @10:03 a.m. This bus was full beyond capacity. Because of the latter bus this driver was pressured and under stress. However, this bus driver was respectful and took his time to accommodate the public. Roll the video back on everything I type. As I said my times, dates, etc. are pretty accurate.  Once again to the consumer. In these times we do not have to riot and loot to express ourselves. You can be right but after committing a crime no one will listen. This bus drivers behavior is unprofessional, lazy, callous, and inconsiderate. When we witness and experience these things we must tell someone. Thank you for reading have a great day."

And don't ask for help at any of the stations, those attendants would rather you not bother them with your ""questions"" or ""do their job"". They do stay open during the winter which is why they get two stars. At least they're consistently subpar regardless of snow and ice."
82,5 star rating,"Aug 31, 2017","I've lived and/or spent time in other major cities in the US, CTA has been mostly great during the 10+ yrs I've lived in Chicago. I imagine it's somewhat elaborate to operate a public transit system. Two 24 hour rail lines that cover N/S/E/W orientation, decent bus service, & Ventra app to manage both CTA & Metra cards are pretty solid. It's also pretty reliable no matter what the weather is like. Awesome additions a few years ago with bus timing via ctabustracker.com & station digital signage. Loop Link is great, too.Obviously it's not perfect - when the buses breaks down, someone urinates on the seat, or there is a street person asking for money - but I guess that is part of the experience. Rush hour bike restrictions are also lame.I couldn't really thrive here if I had to drive everywhere due to cost, yay CTA for $2.25 single ride travel and logical station/stop locations."
83,4 star rating,"May 28, 2014","The Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) is largely an effective system.  I've have only ridden the rails, or ""the El,"" given that the Orange Line is one of the train lines that actually circulates on that elevated ring, or loop, around downtown Chicago which has most of the stops one will need if visiting the Windy City. I don't believe all of their dedicated heavy rail lines travel on this archaic structure, which feels really funky and slow when it's elevated in that ""canyon"" between major buildings in the center of the city.  The Ventra $10 day pass is useful.  It is an easy way to travel in the service zone and cheaper and less cumbersome than buying separate passages.Both O'Hare and Midway airport trains come into the city via traditional subway type cars.  It seems like the system is well thought out, with different nodes at which various lines come together, bus service splices in, and connections to other commuter rail options to the northern suburbs or areas to the south, as far as suburbs in Indiana, are available.  Most of it seems to be above ground but, in the center, the Red Line does function as a subway for at least part of the way and runs parallel to and west of famed Michigan Avenue and its Magnificent Mile.I'm deducting a star because the trains aren't the cleanest, there are some sketchy types on board (damn, that's judgmental), and parts of the infrastructure are old.  There are periodic service interruptions to address this.  I got nabbed in such an interruption.  On the Orange Line from Midway, the track between two important stations, Halsted and Roosevelt, was closed for work.  For a trek that should take about 4 or 5 minutes on the train, the ""bus bridge,"" with its waits on both ends, took about 20 minutes.  Then, if you think the track infrastructure is old, check out the dated stations in the Loop, which look like something put together at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution.  Regardless, they have their charm.When you first board a CTA train, the first thing that hits you over the head is how multiethnic, diverse, and crusty Chicago is.  Yet, despite that, there are NO bilingual announcements.  How would that even be feasible?  So many different people from different places around the globe live there that it would point to some sort of ""favoritism.""  For that lack of bilingual announcements, I'd almost give them that star back.  Sorry, but that's just a pet peeve of mine.  But, hey, at 4 stars, neither they nor I should complain."
84,3 star rating,"Jun 27, 2017","This is coming from a tourist from Des Moines that doesn't deal with public transportation, especially on this scale.If visiting is using the CTA an efficient way to get around town? Yes. For the most part I would say yes. We stayed out by the airport so by utilizing the park and ride we were able to travel to both Wrigley Field and downtown, using the L and buses. On the multiple rides we took we never really had issues with delays.Is the CTA clean? Clean is a relative term. Most of the trains themselves seemed clean on the inside. Some of the stations on the other hand were downright dingy and stinky. I'm not a germophobe but there were surfaces on both the train and at the stations that I refused to touch.Is the CTA safe? It's public transportation in the third largest city in the US. Safety can sometimes be a gamble. I would say that if you are riding during the day or during peak times like before/after a Cubs game gets out, you will probably be safe. I'm not sure I would ride it after sundown but that's just Iowa me talking. You will see your fair share of homeless people and beggars at time. For the most part I can deal with that. Luckily in our visits we've never once ran into any type of criminal activity."
85,4 star rating,"Jul 8, 2014","It's kind of hard to rate Chicago's transit system right after visiting NYC.  This is probably the 2nd best mass transit in the country.  But I do have some complaints.  First off, their new Ventra concept is awesome.  One of those smart tap credit cards.  Genius! However, it does cost you $5 per card.  But I guess that technology does not come cheap.If you're a visitor for more than a couple of days go with one of the unlimited packages.  You will totally use the value and then some.We had the weekly unlimited pass even though we were there for 4 days.  After the 2nd day we had used up the price and then on the way back to the airport instead of a cab ride we paid for the original cost of the cards.As far as the transit system if you stick to the trains (color lines), it's spectacular, but when you start using their bus system, is when you want to start pulling your hair out.The color lines run pretty consistent and are fast.  The buses on the other hand are hit or miss.  Certain buses by the end of the trip I noticed were more on time.  While other more specialized buses, I guess, would often miss there time window not once or twice and end up arriving after the 3rd schedule pick up.  Other times the bus drivers would just look at you and keep on driving.  By the end of the trip I had decided no more buses and just walk to the nearest line and take that and walk some more because the buses were so unreliable even if it provided a ""shorter route""."

88,2.5 star rating,,"Writing this review as a lowly tourist from Atlanta who's spent most of her adult life riding our podunk-ass MARTA:So I was in Chicago for about 5 days and got a week-long pass because 1) I stayed in a place that was two blocks from a stop and 2) I knew I'd be doing a shit ton of touristy things like going to a ton of museums, galleries, jazz clubs (Green Mill, holla), hipster bars and barcades, etc. So the convenience alone of being able to zip from one place to another was a Godsend. I mean, I could get from my AirBnB and be at Stan's Donuts in Wicker Park in like 20 minutes or so- that's WITH a transfer from a green line to a blue line. There were some delays occassionally, but hell, that's life, so I wasn't too fussed about them. Yeah it was pretty cold and that sucked, but they have heating stations, y'all. HEATING STATIONS. Let me tell something about petty-ass MARTA in Atlanta. One winter's night when I was waiting for a bus at one of the train stations that happens to have a little heating station - two workers there were warming themselves up, I waited til they left so I could get me some of that good warm heat. So they proceeded to turn that shit off as soon as they were done using it. Bastids. Anyways, heating stations throughout the fall-winter are a major plus AND they're always on? WHAT? Let's see, even the busses - when I had to take one - weren't too bad. They were mostly clean, usually timely, some of the little bus shelters have the upcoming times scrolling on a screen. WOW! You can even text a special number with the route that you're waiting for and some magic machine will text you the upcoming times - friggin amazing!What else, the trains, busses, stations were mostly clean, especially within the loop. The people, well you see all kinds of people on public transpo. So I guess if you're like scared by ""sketchy"" looking people - don't go to Chicago...just kidding - take Uber or rent a car.The workers there when I needed help getting somewhere were quite helpful also. Don't be scared to ask most of them know the lines like the back of their hand. The only thing that CAN be kind of confusing is all the different lines, but I'm coming from a place with literally only two goddamn lines so maybe I was overwhelmed. And I'm not going to lie; I did get lost a lot. But, definitely if you're staying in/near the loop, get you a pass for however many days and enjoy the convenience of CTA."

I appreciate that it runs 24 hours to and from the airport, that's where the issue comes.The trains on this line are overly used and it is starting to show.  The archaic seating arrangement isn't very conducive to all the bags being brought on from O'Hare.  After seeing the newer train cars on other lines I was shocked that the blue line didn't get them first.The seats on the train we got on last night were horribly dirty/stained.  Hope the blue line gets new cars soon!"
92,4 star rating,"Aug 25, 2016","Took CTA on 8/24/16, this was my first visit to Chicago so I was constantly looking for comparisons between NYC transit authority and Chicago's.      First I must mention cleanliness. I took the train from O'Hare to Monroe station and did not see any liter on neither train nor station. Thumbs up to both residents and the transit authority for doing such a magnificent job at caring for your environment.      Also navigation was pretty straight forward I was able to look up directions using my iPhone days before my trip. Upon arrival to the airport I was able to  follow the signs to the transit station. I also bought my Ventura pass needing no assistance as the machines were pretty straight forward.    I was swiping in incorrectly and transit workers nearby quickly showed me to place it over the yellow area and I was on my way. Considering I was traveling at peek rush hour I was shocked that there  were no delays. Overall Chicago's transit system is light years ahead of NY as we are now getting the digitally time updates of when the busses will be arriving: anyways I found the CTA system to be efficient and I'm happy I utilized it. This was the cheapest option to get from the airport to my downtown destination."

Guests from out of town reported this plus confusing bus stop signs during weekend service. Waited hours for a bus that would never arrive. #130 does not run on Sunday? No bus driver they asked from any route could tell them how to get from Union to museum campus. So, they UBER'd it. Even costed less than bus fare. What a waste of tax dollars."

95,5 star rating,"Mar 13, 2017","Five stars on Yelp means ""as good as it gets,"" and Chicago's public transit is, by far, as good as public transit gets--at least, as far as I can tell. Compared to Boston, Philadelphia, Washington, Houston, New York... Chicago knows what it's doing!Rail service is frequent and almost rarely delayed due to traffic. Well, maybe there are slight delays here and there, but I wouldn't know because I leave early every day anyway, and I'm pretty sure traffic is built into the scheduling.CTA is pretty responsive on Twitter and it's actually cool to check out the feed. They share interesting stuff. Even better, though, is that people complain sometimes to the CTA and the CTA staff are experts at tactfully shutting down people who make mountains out of molehills.I refuse to permit the denizens of the train system to impact a rating on its reliability, but I must acknowledge the reality. Sometimes the trains really do smell like pee. Sometimes there are people who reek of urine sleeping on the train. Sometimes people who reek of urine ride the overnight trains so they can sleep on the train. That's... reality. And it's also a human services issue, not a public transportation issue. Maybe if there were sufficient social services so people facing homelessness or already are homeless had places to go where they were treated with dignity, the trains wouldn't smell like pee.Then again, I take the red line, and one lesson has been learned: the same bros who complain about the homeless passengers do a great job puking and pissing on the train, too."
96,1 star rating,"Sep 1, 2016","The CTA has been around for 69 years and still is as unpredictable and unreliable now was it probably was in 1947.  Scratch that, in 1947 there probably was more accountability on drivers, analysts, and managers to make sure buses run on time.Poor children, parents with children, elderly, and disabled people who have to stand through painfully brutal winters because the CTA likes to play ""spot the 3 buses coming at once"" then no bus for 20 minutes.Seriously, if you want to travel back in time, jump on one of these time machines.The truly sad part is that everybody is suffering in silence when these buses/trains run ridiculously inefficiently, because, for the most part, Chicagoans/Midwesterners are polite people and there really is no place to actively share grievances.Just like what Uber and Lyft did to the taxicab industry, the CTA's fate will eventually come to a happy end when innovative privatization comes along with some better because people demand better."
97,1 star rating,"Jun 8, 2018",The Ventra Card debacle!  The cta has its own problems but now they have a for profit company that we pay a premium to - in increased rates - that adds to the CTA's problems.Ventra sent us a faulty card.  The ventra operator on the phone (since it's a school card) could not issue us a new card.  Instead we have to reapply for a new card ourselves and pay another fee for the new card.  Then we can call in and they will credit the new card with the old defective card remaining balance.What a pain and super stupid and inefficient process.  This is what happens when you sell off government services people - it doesn't get any better only more expensive.  AND you now pay a premium because you've got shareholders who need a return.Ugh!  CTA - what else can Chicago sell off to profiteers at the expense of it's citizens?!?!?!
98,4 star rating,"Feb 23, 2012","Probably on the best public transporation systems. I was using CTA for a couple of years when I was in Chicago.Few of the facts about CTA--The monthly pass just costs $86 and single ride is $2.25 with a transfer just costing 25 cents and second transfer is free (Transfer should be done within 2 hours of start of journey)--They have a CTA tracker application where one can track the buses. It is really awesome and is accurate 95% of the time.One can also get the update to date information on schedule by sending a text message.--Awesome connectivity to trains connecting suburbs.They have link up pass which just costs $45 and one can use it on CTA and PACE buses to travel to union station to catch the Metra Trains. There is nothing like link up pass in NYC which makes one buy different passes (LIRR, Subway,PATH etc).-- The stations on almost all the CTA lines are super clean and very well maintained unlike the subway stations on MTA in NYC.Though I adore CTA but there have been times when it has annoyed me. The most annoying thing which I observed  was that multiple buses arrive at the same time. That just does not make any sense because the other two buses will go almost empty. Many a times there have been unannounced delays in CTA trains specially in the blue line while going towards Ohare."

I used to take it from the stop at the randolph/wabash to travel to Little Italy village close to UIC campus. Though there are buses from loop to the village but I always felt the train ride was much faster and comfortable. The train does get slow when it enters the loop and unlike blue and red line it does not run 24 hours.

They also have an great website that you can plan trips with that will map your bus and subway route. That helped me get across the city with ease. They also have a phone app!

I had to completely strip down and start over. Pay these robber criminals $5 for a new Chicago Plus Card and wait 10 days for them to get around to sending it to me. Really, CTA. If you were a person, you'd be a degenerate felon criminal. You have no scuples and are not helpful in the LEAST. You just take money for NO service. NO help and with no remorse. Another thing: My CTA card IS NOT A CREDIT CARD. Do NOT add funds with out MY PERMISSION. Damn.The CTA needs to be wiped clean and get a do over.

Sharp metal cleats.IN OTHER NEWS:The entire CTA bus fleet is now GPS-enabled and on the Bus Tracker system. For those of us without fancy web browsing iDunnos, there's a handy new text message feature. (This, while New York's MTA has finally abandoned its failed attempt to implement a similar service.)Sure, the buses tend to be erratic and clump, but I'm growing more convinced that that is largely caused by ignorant, inconsiderate riders who won't buck up and follow a few simple rules:- when the bus pulls up, fucking board it; why shuffle over like you've got a turd halfway out your ass?- have your damned money/card ready as you board; most likely there are people behind you and the bus will not leave until everyone is on- while you're waiting for the bus/behind a malingerer, get your damned money/card ready- move to the rear of the bus as instructed by the big red stickers and the recording of the nice man with the nice Midwestern accent; due to layoffs caused by the economic recession, the CTA will no longer offer complimentary ass-wiping at the entrance- exit at the rear; no one can get on when you exit at the ENTRANCE- don't get all haughty when I tell you you're a dumbass for exiting at the entranceIf we estimate that people who pull these dumbass moves delay a bus by 15 - 30 seconds at every stop, think about how much time that adds to every trip.AND ON THE TRAIN:Similar rules apply. It's even easier than crying into your bottle of BooHoo! I'm not lying. Cross my heart and hope to brand your piggies with my cleats. Truth!I feel that things seem to be going quite well right now. The station agents seem more pleasant, the trains seem to run regularly. The people who complain about piss and vomit like it's a daily occurrence must have severely bad karma. Or maybe they're habitual complainers. Hmm, let's ponder that possibility. The last time I saw vomit on the train was in 1996, and I ride the trains and buses a lot, all over the city, at all times. And even then, I was disgusted by the puke, not at the CTA. Duh!IN CLOSING:The CTA is far from perfect but it really does the job if you can button your pants and shut the hell up. In my dreams, the system would work like the ones in Tokyo, Singapore, Paris and a handful of other cities (but still maintain 24-hour service, of course). If that is to become a reality, we need to do our part. The authorities have a lot of work to do but we certainly shouldn't make it harder for them.Now get out of my way. Cos I've got cleats."
108,4 star rating,"Jan 17, 2009","I've given this some thought and think there's been a misunderstanding.THE CTA IS A PUBLIC TRANSIT SYSTEM, NOT PERSONAL DAYCARE FOR A BUNCH OF OVER-ENTITLED CRYBABIES.Of course there are going to be delays and breakdowns in service if people don't learn to ride responsibly. Here are some simple tips. Feel free to share:- hustle when the train/bus pulls in, don't amble over like you're getting popcorn during commercial break- when you board the train, KEEP MOVING IN as far as possible; don't stop to take in the view- if you're by the door, step off to let others out; this eliminates the irrational fear of riders getting stuck in the car and missing a stop and, therefore, the unwillingness to move towards the centre of the car in the first place- if you're waiting to board, wait till others have exited; only salmon should work so hard against an oncoming deluge- your groceries, backpack, laptops and miscellaneous bullshit didn't pay a fare so they are not entitled to their own seat- SIT DOWN if there's an empty seat so others can move in; you're not a hero for standing that extra stop or two- resist the urge to chat with the bus driver and MOVE DOWN THE BUS- exit buses at the rear whenever possible so you don't impede rapid boarding at the ENTRANCE; there are stickers and announcements requesting you do this so there's no excuse for you not to do so, unless you're deaf and blind as well as stupid- speak up if you witness dumbassedness; crying into your Pinot Grigio after the fact helps absolutely no one- keep your boring cellphone/live conversations to yourselves, and turn your cheesy music down (well, none of these disrupts service but I just want to point out that you're neither interesting, special nor important)I used to get frustrated at the CTA for their seeming incompetence, but when I really thought hard about it, a large part of the problem fell squarely on the empty heads of many who use the system. You can throw all the money and planning you want into the CTA and they will still fail if people insist on working against them. There's no way the CTA can overcome millions of lazy, ignorant dumbasses coming at them each day. Simply none.Don't even try comparing the CTA to mass transit systems in other cities. Well, if you do, first use them and take note of how much more civic-minded their riders are. Even in New York, whose residents are much maligned for being 'assholes', you will note that people generally approach public transit as a PUBLIC SERVICE, meaning no one gets special treatment unless they actually need it. No one on the MTA will put up with any of the shit that happens on the CTA. If that makes them assholes, it also makes you a dumbass crybaby.No doubt, the system is far from perfect. I think we all know that. But if we truly want the CTA to improve and succeed, we have to do our part. Yes, whining to your friends is easier and probably more fun, but it doesn't get the job done.One more thing: KEEP YOUR DAMNED HOOVES OFF THE SEATS. That's just fucked up."
109,4 star rating,"Apr 7, 2012","Disclaimer:  I was only in town for 5 days, in a sub-let in Wicker Park.  That said, I *love* the CTA!  We used the Blue Line to get from O'Hare to Wicker Park, and from Division to the Loop.  We used the Red Line to get to opening day at Wrigley, and took the Brown Line back to the Loop.  We took various buses to the Museum of Science and Industry and to the Field Museum.  We traveled early to mid-morning, and typically came home during rush hour.  With all that, the longest we ever waited for a ride was 8 minutes after having just missed the #6 bus from Science & Industry.  The rush hour crowds were no worse than anywhere else, and significantly better than in my native NYC.The only down side, IMHO, was insufficient explanation regarding the difference between CTA and Pace services - at O'Hare, anyway... so we wound up paying for services (Pace) we didn't need.  I think some simple signage by the vending machine would set that right.  Oh, and without Pace, it's only $23 for unlimited rides over 7 days ($28 with Pace).  Kudos to the CTA!"
110,4 star rating,"Oct 24, 2015","After reviewing my Ventra card activity after our 5 day stay in the Windy City, we tallied 32 bus rides and 8 L rides total. Without any major issues on our travels using CTA, I can say that I am a fan. We got full value out of the $28 7-day pass Ventra card. If you don't want to mess around with the refunded $5 card fee when you purchase at a machine, you can go to the ventra website prior to your trip and they will mail your card to you without the $5 charge. I would go to the Ventra website anyway if you're unfamiliar with the system. There is plenty of helpful information and videos which will probably answer any questions you may have.We didn't spend a dime on a rental car, cab, or UBER. We never worried about things like taking a wrong turn or getting lost. We didn't have to drive around in circles to find parking nor did we have to follow anyone to their parking spot. We were never late. And we didn't pay one parking fee, especially the bend-you-over hotel overnight parking fee.From our Magnificent Mile hotel location to any of our destinations, we never had to make more than one transfer and we never had to walk more than two or three blocks. Google Maps was an invaluable tool that I used to get from point A to B that never let us down. We were able to find exact departure and arrival times, stop locations, and bus/train numbers using the app.Yes, it is public transportation so there are some unsanitary areas. You're sure to find some homeless and just general Shady McGradys hanging out. I was always aware of my surroundings and I never felt threatened or in danger.I'll have no problem using CTA on my next trip to Chicago and the hundreds I save will be used for a nice dinner or to upgrade to a hotel in a more convenient location."

I think for the most part the buses arrive on time, they do remind me of MTA in NYC but for some reason New York just does it better. The CTA is probably the cheapest way to get around town in Chicago, especially if you're a tourist which reminds me I need to go download some maps so I can plan my next trip out accordingly. It's definitely not as good as other public transports I've experienced but it's efficient along the lakefront areas and sufficient for where I want to go. At $23 or $28 for a full 7-day unlimited use, this is probably the best way to go which saves a great amount of bus fare for one trip. Good for traveling while on business when you don't want to deal with the incredible parking fees around Chicago."

113,4 star rating,"Jun 13, 2013","The few times I've ridden the CTA I've been thoroughly impressed.  The trains (speaking for the blue & red lines) are pretty clean, the announcements are easy to hear & understand.  They even tell you what side of the train the doors open on... how fantastic is that. The signage used throughout is easy to read and clear to follow.  And they've got some super friendly employees working in their booths.  Many thanks to both who pointed me in the right direction.Bonus points for the CTA buses.  Each bus stop had a scrolling schedule to let passengers know when the next bus was coming.  As a NYC resident who doesn't have this... I thought it was awesome."

It is so ridiculously bad at providing service i am better off walking the majority of the time. I try to use the tracker for buses but a crystal ball is more accurate at telling when a bus arrives.  The only thing the tracker is good for is telling you when to watch the bus leaving you behind because it got there before you could.  I wish i could never ever use their service again.

We then have today's fellow who doesn't seem to understand with the sun glaring right in your eyes (or if a customer was visually impaired) that we need a short lecture on how to swipe our card. It is one of those petty power type of conversations that can be maddening when dealing with City employees. Bus drivers, as all people, must be aware that not everyone has the same eyesight, dexterity and other human conditions as does everyone else. Yet, I applaud the many kind and considerate bus drivers I encounter on a frequent basis!"

120,3 star rating,"Sep 9, 2005","The motto of the CTA is ""Take it"", so I do. I have been around the world and have been spoiled by excellent public transportation systems in other countries. The CTA is pretty efficient along the lakefront mainly because of numerous bus routes. Otherwise the service is mediocre at best for the rest of the city."
121,4 star rating,"Nov 23, 2008","For all its faults, and there are many, the CTA rocks. I don't know how I would survive in a city that didn't have a public transportation system. Really, I am an impatient person and if I had to drive everywhere and fight for parking regularly I'd probably be in jail for road rage. So thanks CTA for keeping me on the right side of the law. I've been riding the CTA my whole life, way back before the days of the fare cards, Chicago Cards and those now defunct tokens. I remember the days of A & B trains and the conductor announcing each stop, which sounded like someone screaming into a mic with a mouth full of rocks. All I can say is kudos for all of the improvements, it's definitely made things more efficient and rider friendly! I know people know people are frequently dogging the CTA, but seriously people, like John B, most of my complaints are with the riders. Use some common courtesy once in a while! Here are some tips: * Say excuse me, don't just push by people* If the bus is filling up, put your crap on your lap* Don't clog the front of the bus or stand under the back sensor so the door inevitably jams and the driver has to come fix it* If the bus or L is crowded and there's an empty seat you're standing in front of take it; I don't care if you get off at the next stop, it creates room. Or move so someone else can.* Get up for the pregnant, elderly and handicapped* Tourists and infrequent riders do a little up front research, we all hate when you stand in the doorway playing 20 questions with the driver while we all wait.My 2 favorite things about the CTA? Chicago Card and Bus Tracker. Seriously, like other Yelpers have said the #11 has become my new BFF since getting added to bus tracker, and thanks for doing it just before winter too!  Now please go and get the other routes I ride on bus tracker - double time!Bottom line: Despite some of its faults and sometimes smelly buses or trains the CTA is great. TIP: If you lose/break your Chicago Card, or if it blows out of your hand and gets run over by a train, you can order one online for pick-up or delivery OR you can go to the CTA office in the West Loop and get a new one on the spot.TIP: This trip planner works way better than the Google one http://tripsweb.rtachicago.com/"
122,3 star rating,"Nov 1, 2013","There are positives here. The train services both the major airports of Chicago, and runs reasonably fast to the heart of the city and services a wide variety of other areas. It's ridiculously cheap. It's one fare to go anywhere in the system, unless you get on at the airport which costs twice as much (but still not a whole lot). The one employee I interacted with at length had no clue about places to eat near the station where she worked (odd), but was at least friendly enough to help with a few things.The downsides are that the trains are dirty, crowded, and look like they're from the '60s. It's a confusing system and it seemed I wasn't the only one who needed help understanding the ticketing, the gates, and the stops. Their machines don't give change. Many stops are not handicap accessible (and also a challenge for anyone with luggage). It seems like a broken down old system in need of major overhaul.As compared to public transit in my hometown (DC), there were two key advantages. One: nothing broke down while I was there. Two, at least they're not gouging on fares."
123,3 star rating,"Sep 17, 2008","For all of the talk about how much financial trouble the CTA is in, I expected their Customer Service Center on Lake Street to be in some dank basement .  And based on the level of service I'd heard about, I had the mental picture of it being in a dungeon with apparatus for torturing those poor souls who need customer service from one of Chicago's least popular abbreviation agencies.If function followed form, the customer service center should be a beautiful experience.  The second story of CTA Headquarters in the west loop is an airy, open space, and well climate controlled.  The glass and steel design makes it seem like it would be space aged and fast.  Kind of an anti-Secretary of State's office.In general customer service there was this potential pleasant experience.  The Customer Service desk knew exactly what to do to replace an expired Chicago Plus card I had for which the replacement had got lost in the mail.  The purchasing clerk who I saw first, on the other hand, seemed have no idea where my card was or what my desire was (that I wanted to pick up a new card and have the one lost in the mail cancelled).What was odd about splitting my transaction was that the customer service clerk seemed to have more information about my transit card than the purchasing clerk.  The guy working Customer Service gave me a number on a post-it-note and told me exactly what to say to Purchasing.  When I said these words, a glimmer of recognition crossed the face of purchasing and the transaction was done in two minutes.  Why CTA has customer service and purchasing done by two separate people I'm not sure (I though they administered a lot of redundant administration).  I'm glad they weren't together, however, or my experience with purchasing would have rated a pure one star (when I came back on Monday to find no replacement card).  Customer service seemed like more of an ombudsman than anything.  Just a recommendation: unless you know exactly what to ask, see customer service first and not second.All that being said, for cut-and-dry situations, purchasing has four windows running at lunch and the lines went incredibly quickly.If everyone was cross-trained in the service area at CTA headquarters, the overall experience would match the sleek design of the offices."
124,1 star rating,"Jan 23, 2007","Crain's Chicago Business and Time Out both just published broad editorials ripping CTA up one side and down the other.  Why?  Anyone who has ridden mass transit in another country will be disappointed.  That's why I was disappointed on arriving in Chicago and witnessing the dilapidated state CTA is in.  That was in 1996.  And I was comparing it to Japan and Korea, where you don't need a car in any major city because you can take mass transit anywhere.  And it's always clean and always on time.  You can practically set your watch even by bus service in those countries.  It's hard to put into words how malnourished mass transit is here, especially after the recent alleged ongoing ""improvements"".  CTA is suffering from decades of neglect.  Chicago taxpayers are missing out on so much more than they know."

I knew we would take the train into the city from O'Hare but in all honesty I didn't do much research, other than knowing our hotel was near a stop on the Loop.  Signage was great!  We were easily and quickly able to find the train at the airport.  The ticket kiosks were also very simple to use.  I bought a 3-day unlimited pass for $20.  The train ride into town was about 40 minutes.  It's a little tough with luggage, but very doable.  The train obviously got more congested as we made our way downtown.  Train cars were decent.  Similar to MUNI in SF.  Maps were visible and easy to read.  We later took the train up to Wrigley Field and then back to the airport.  It made our trip pretty flawless and cheap!"

I ride the Metra from the South Suburbs to downtown (which is pretty good), then ride the Pink Line between Washington/Wabash and 18th St. I swear...every single day there are a number of delays. The longest delays seem to occur during the evening rush hour.I guess, if you have never traveled to developed nations, having limited experience with only America's public transportation, this norm may not be THAT bad. However, as someone whom has traveled to more than 20 countries, the CTA (along with the majority of public railing in the country) is absolutely atrocious. As anecdotes, while visiting Australia, Europe, and much of Asia-I was thoroughly impressed with how their subways and elevated rail cars operated like clockwork...arriving on schedule to the exact minute. While the Metra is comparable to other developed nations, every single day I wonder, ""why, in the hell won't the CTA (and America) consult with other nations in order to learn the correct methods for operating public transportation?"" I've been to Third World nations with more timely and reliable rail service than the CTA."

137,4 star rating,"Sep 30, 2010","Before moving to St. Louis, I would've given the CTA two or three stars.  Many a cold January morning did I stand on the sidewalk waiting for my bus, only to see FOUR 22s or 36s all bunched together in a convoy, each bus unable to escape from the pack.  Which bus will stop for you and which will blow past you?  Which bus is jammed with people and which is nearly empty?  Which bus will win in the weekly North-South Leapfrog Contest and get you downtown the fastest?This isn't nearly the extent of the problems with the buses, and I won't even address the trains here.  But for all the CTA's quirks, its rude passengers and gruff drivers, and its downright maddening qualities, it is a comparatively well-run, efficient, cheap, reliable, and convenient method of transportation.Occasionally, one experiences per se awful or excellent service and Yelps about it, but by and large, reviews are written and stars are given to an establishment based on its relative performance to like establishments.  I compare the CTA to the St. Louis and DC Metros.  Based on the operation of those two outfits, without reviewing them here, I can confidently give the CTA four stars."
138,2 star rating,"Apr 25, 2018","I love Chicago and was looking forward to playing tour guide to some friends from FL who decided to spend the week there. I wanted all to go smoothly and researched which train stops had elevators in order to avoid 2 60+ year olds and a millenial female from having to carry heavy luggage up or down stairs. The trip began to sour almost immediately because the elevator at the Roosevelt station was out of order. OK, things happen. We needed to switch to the red line and had to go outside in the cold around a building to another elevator dragging all the bags with us. That was when I became embarrassed for the City and for myself because I am always bragging about Chicago. The elevator smelled like a sewer and the liquid on the floor of it was something you do not want to step in or stand your suitcases in. Fortunately, someone was kind enough to open the gate to the train for us so that we did not have to pay again and we boarded the red line. Going to O'Hare for 7AM return flight yesterday, the elevator at Clark and Lake was just being locked. The man said it was ""not acting right.""  I had no time to waste and so I asked him to let me take one more ride (willing to take my chances), but when the elevator went down, the door would only open 7 inches and could not be forced open (would have been nice if he had told me that was the problem), so I wasted time going back up and finding the escalator. Thank goodness that was working because sometimes it is not. SO DEAREST CHICAGO:  Elevators in train stations are CRUCIAL. It is already a shame that they are not in every station, but $$$$ MUST be spent to make sure they NEVER break down. Elevator function needs to be checked and fixed on every one during the night so they are not malfunctioning at rush hour. This is not just for seniors with luggage, but parents with strollers and people in wheelchairs needing to get to work. These elevators look like they have done their time, they move at a snail's pace and need to be replaced. And providing a public restroom with BIG signs to them in the station may deter people from urinating in the elevators. That is a health hazard and an embarrassment to the City of Chicago."

However, with parking, insurance, and towing in the winter, I knew I had to become friends with CTA this summer. And I did. I have been too/ lived in a few major cities and Chicago was made for CTA. I mean, I really only have to pay $90 a month to get around anywhere and anytime. I love that I can text to know when the next bus is coming. I love the heaters on the train's stops in the winter. I like that CTA expanded its Zip Car efforts. I like the Chicago Plus card. I also like how CTA has made sure it's connected to the Metro and South Shore line. My family and I appreciate this. You can learn the city by learning your way around the Red Line. Ok, so improvements for CTA would be having cleaner cars for the trains, have police/security ride the trains for peddle handlers (esp. now during the holidays), and heat at every train stop (what about Brown-Kedzie!) I think adding more bus shelters with the marquee would be helpful they have in Hyde Park. Other than that, it IS public transportation. Keep that in mind, we better be grateful Chicago has invested in a public trans system as large and outreached as CTA is, as other large cities are still trying to figure out how to get to our level. I've seen and experienced much worst. No worries about gas, insurance, parking, towing...the list goes on; I like it! CTA is a life saver and I will sure miss it when I leave Chi-town. CTA and I are friends."
145,1 star rating,"Oct 8, 2014","It's been a long time coming, but I finally remembered to review the gruesome, inefficient, Chicago Transit Authority Corporation. The services provided by the CTA truly epitomize the essence of incompetence. From the rampant crime in almost every station, to the recurring smell of urine in almost every station, there isn't anything remotely enjoyable about riding the CTA except for the occasional El ride with an empty car and a nice view. Unfortunately, most of us city dwellers are forced to ride it, because who wants to pay for parking or a cab every single day?! I sure as hell do not. Ventra has been a nightmare; I am routinely charged extra by the machines, and despite writing complaints, I am never refunded. Further, the trains are consistently overcrowded with uneven run times, making the commutes last longer. Efficiency is not the CTA's strong suit. Also, who remembers the moron who fell asleep at the wheel and crashed a train into the O'Hare escalator!?There is really nothing good to say about the CTA. It's a shame so many of us are so reliant on it. It's like the airlines or cable companies - we hate them, but we are forced to use them! Damn monopolies... The dysfunctional inner workings illustrate even further how the government should not run companies like this. Public trans, unlike our parking meters, should absolutely be contracted out!"

Fares have remained low. (I now live in the San Francisco area, where commuter train fares are charged by distance, and most rides are quite expensive by comparison to Chicago.) While CTA doesn't necessarily run according to its timetable, it has so many routes and they run so often that most of the time (other than late at night), there is rarely too much of a delay. The buses and trains are pretty clean compared to many years ago. I am not a fan of the new Ventra fare system where you have to pay an initial $5 deposit plus your fare, and then go online to get the $5 back. Pain in the @$$.

Anywhos this system is well laid out to dropping us off at nearby tourist targets.  I had the 3 day pass; it worked wonders for the bus and subway.  I kind of wished the interior stank of fresh flowers and the ride was somewhat faster.  Not up to par with new york's system, but better than having nothing like it in the bay area.

So once we finally get there (Roosevelt) they made everyone wait in line to get back onto the train as if we were all criminals trying to sneak on for free... but the icing on the cake is they didn't even have the decency to have a green line train waiting on standby nope I stood there for an additional 10+ minutes before I had to hop on a completely different train to get close to my destination so that I wouldn't be late even though I made sure to add an extra hour to my commute to try to accommodate for this reroute. Then when you ask the CTA employee basic questions they all act clueless as if your bothering them! I will never do this crap again. I would rather pay an UBER $20  before I deal with this crap
156,4 star rating,"Sep 2, 2014","After spending three days on the CTA, I'm impressed. Yes, it's a little slow and it's old. Could it use updates? Sure. However, it functions getting people out and around the city. I commuted in from the Rosemont station. My favorite line is the Brown Line. I rode the Brown, Red and the Blue Lines. The Red Line is definitely a lot grittier than the other lines. Unlike New York, the line wasn't completely congested with panhandlers, but you definitely had to be aware of your surroundings. It did get very crowded at times, but it was easy to navigate. Plus you can't beat the view from the Brown Line. I'd ride it again just for that view. So take it for what it is. Well used, filled with ""interesting characters"", easy to navigate, with a few hidden gems along the way. Tip - avoid the lines and buy your Ventra pass anywhere but the station."
157,4 star rating,"Nov 13, 2008","To say I was born on the CTA is an exaggeration. To say I rode the CTA before I was able to walk is not.Rating the CTA is almost impossible for me. It's like an aging relative -- sometimes it has good days, sometimes it has bad days. Are the good days good enough to make up for the bad days? For me, yes.It's unfortunate that the CTA is a victim of our corrupt political system. No one in power is really vested in fixing the CTA. Its perpetual budget crisis is due in part to mismanagement from within, but primarily from the fact that politicians have more to gain from a transit system that is at least partially broken -- and which they can use to feed voters on both sides -- than one that works smoothly. Oh jeez, here I am on that soapbox again.There are things to hate about the CTA. The 22 Clark bus is a mystery. It runs on whatever schedule it likes, and has done so for at least 15 years. The construction crews, which always seem to consist of at least twice as many men necessary to do the job, are a constant annoyance. But the CTA allows me to live in Chicago without a car, and is one of the things that has kept me here so long.You know what I hate most about the CTA? People. And by ""people,"" I don't mean CTA employees, despite the occasional rude driver. I mean the fuckwads who ride the system. The people who won't move to the back of the bus, or who stand in the exit door when there's plenty of room, or who spread themselves out over several seats. This is the latest development -- people who don't there stuff on the seat next to them, but the seat in front of them. WTF! Unfortunately, we live in a world of jerks, and there's nothing the CTA can do about that. Which is why I feel free to chew these idiots out whenever possible."
158,4 star rating,"Sep 10, 2011","The CTA covers a wide area including downtown (the Loop, Magnificent Mile), O'Hare Airport, Midway Airport, Chinatown, Lincoln Park, etc. It's affordable ($2.25 per ride), easy to use and with clear signs. The trains for most lines seem to come frequently (I've never had to wait a long time) and the stops aren't too far apart. They have express trains (skips stops) during peak hours. There aren't many escalators, so be prepared to climb stairs. Platforms in the downtown area are popular with street performers. When you're on the train, each stop is announced. There are also system maps inside each car.It's hard to find a 1 day pass at times. You have to go to Rite Aid, CVS or a similar store (but not Walgreens) and currency exchange shops to get the 1 day pass and they tend to sell out. It would be convenient to be able to buy it at the O'Hare stop, but that's not an option."

In high school I'd commute to school using the max and Trimet in Portland. Nowadays when I can, I'd rather just walk it or if it's late I'll cab it. I find that when I'm on the CTA, I often times think of evil mean thoughts. *ugh take a shower! Nasty ass. Shouldn't you be potty trained by now? I am and I know some 2 year olds that are, stank bitch. Ew stop eating on the train you savage, I don't wanna smell that! Must you drink that stank beer on here right now? You're not even in cubs gear. Get your own money you money grubbing whore, I worked hard for this shit. Get away from me you weirdo or I'm ready to Lysol spray your face. Blow your fuckin nose BITCH. Tissue is 1.39 walgreen's. Fuck*  Atleast in my very own car I can avoid homeless people asking every single person on the train if they can spare some change then leaving a putrid strong odor of rotten piss mixed with death for everyone's enjoyment. The joys of urine soiled clothes! Gulp. Good gawd its strong and I've encountered this lady a couple times now on the green and red line. Get the fuck out of my face. Gaaaah..!  The hyena on the red line that sings out loud and off tune like a mentally ill cat and hyena hybrid in heat to Britney spears songs. STFU. Even my iPod at full blast couldn't tune this shit out. He/she gets on the redline at the grand or chicago stop. That's not soo bad though compared to...Person eating noodles in a black garbage bag with their bare hands and slurping loudly. I had to put my iPod volume on a little higher and look somewhere else thinking happy thoughts. The smell, the sounds, the sight made me nauseous.The monologues of why they deserve your spare change is ok because I can usually tune it out with my iPod. Then I close my eyes and think of a happy place.Besides the colorful and inconsiderate passengers you have to share your ride with ( hello bigger riders that plop down beside me and sit spread eagle... Squishing me. While sneezing without covering your damn mouth. Seriously?) I also can barely stand the incompetence of the CTA. Late/early arrivals, delays, taking forever to get places that shouldn't take that long to get to, etc.. I felt like I could get so much more done driving myself. I feel that the best way to cope with my temporary ridership of the CTA is to play it like I'm dead inside. Become a zombie robot waiting and riding the CTA, then back to lively me once I get off. Zombie robot.. Lively lively!.... Zombie robot... Zombie robot.... Lively lively... Zombie robot....Lively lively!Driving and owning a car is a luxury and believe me, it's worth every penny. It's not that hard to avoid getting parking tickets or towed. It's called reading signs. Look into that. I'm doing it again SOON and I'd rather sit in traffic anyday. Besides, if you're an efficient driver, it's not that hard.Remember: play dead on the inside if you have to rely on the CTA. And Lysol spray-doubles as a weapon and air freshner. Good Gawd."

I take it everyday from work, and it certainly is a great route for those in the Pilsen area to get in and out of the Loop. However, I don't think this thing could go any slower once it actually does get into the Loop. The Pink Line is like all the other lines' doofy little brother. Or that friend that every group has who is alright to hang out with in bits, but once he starts coming around all the time everyone's like, ""Whoa man, Pink Line is starting to bug me. Maybe we should stop letting him know when we go out. Last night, after he got a few beers in him, he was going on and on about how he had a dece makeout with Gina and I was all like 'Alright dude, I get it.' Seriously, I missed the Counting Crow's whole set because of it."" What I mean is, the Pink Line is at the very bottom of the order when it comes to the other lines. It has to stop and wait for everything. You can never get a straight shot on that thing. There are always a ton of stops and that stupid ""waiting for signal clearance"" announcement. Sometimes they'll let 2 or 3 Orange Line trains go before they will switch the tracks. No joke. Plus, when you're waiting for it, you'll see repeats of all the other lines pass before Pinky finally decides to come rolling through. Does no one care about the Pink Line? It could be nice if it got some respect, like Rodney Dangerfield."
161,4 star rating,"Jul 5, 2010","This review is an example of how speaking up actually solves problems. Even on the CTA!So, those who know me know that I am a creature of habit. I get up at the same time every day, leave at the same time every day, etc. I like being on a schedule. Schedules are fun.Suddenly the CTA started to mess with that schedule. I was leaving my apartment at the same time, but the express bus that I normally caught to work simply stopped coming. I tracked it on the bus tracker, and sure enough - it just disappeared. The next express bus came 10 minutes later, but then I would end up being a few minutes late to work... and I HATE HATE HATE being late, even if no one else cares.One morning I decided to email the CTA and ask them why they got rid of this bus run, thus putting about 30 minutes between two express buses in the morning.Here's the key - I didn't email them and act super bitchy like I'm sure a million people do. I simply asked a question, gave them the information from the bus schedule on their site so they would know exactly which bus I was talking about, and I even took a screen shot of the bus tracker so they could see that there was a bus missing.The NEXT MORNING... as in, less than 24 hours after I sent my email, they had a supervisor at my usual bus stop. He asked a few of us waiting if we were waiting for that specific bus, and we all said yes. We all told him it hasn't been coming for a few weeks, and at first he was sarcastic with us... until he saw we were right. Oooh, burn, CTA man!A few hours later the CTA emailed me, letting me know that I was correct (don't you love hearing that?), there was a problem with that run and the supervisors were on it.It took a couple days, but now that run is back to it's regular schedule, and so am I. It comes like clockwork every day when it's supposed to, and this makes me happy.So folks, if you have a problem with the CTA, here's my advice - as frustrating as it can be, know that no system is perfect. Don't give them attitude, just contact them with as much factual information as you can. It seems like they actually do care and when they are given proper info, they will do their best to fix it.Now, let's just hope this review doesn't jinx my bus..."
162,1 star rating,"Dec 11, 2013","It gets you where you need to go, but holy hell do you ever pay for it, from rude bus drivers to stalled out trains, this mode of transportation is the pits. I swear that the bus drivers actually try to knock  you over by pushing down on the gas as soon as you swipe your oh so classy ventra payment card, way before you have a chance to even look for a handrail, it must be some kind of game. The schedule is totally theoretical, not something you can rely upon, it's kind of like being in Colorado and using a map of Kentucky to find your way around. For people who are poor and/or are trying to be environmentally conscious, you sure feel like you are being punished if you subscribe to the hellish conditions of the cta. Every morning I get on the train, it smells as if it has been raining urine, I believe there is a hidden sprinkler system that sprays piss all over the seats and floors right after the ""end of the line"" announcement is given. To transfer at the Washington train platform, you have to pay, the others are free, why? Because the urine sprinkler system is disabled and you have a chance to browse the dozens of merchandise carts that sell iPhone cases. When I travel on the cta, I truly hate myself and every decision I have ever made, you will too, join the city of Chicago in hating yourself, where you come from and where you are going. Just remind yourself that you only have you wait another 8 hours before you get to use it again."
163,4 star rating,"Apr 30, 2009","Though I can for sure say that this isn't the absolute greatest transit in the world (Europe's got way more on us), I'm a huge, huge fan of the Chicago Transit Authority.  I have been prompted to update my review after visiting their newly updated website (www.transitchicago.com) and being pleasantly surprised.  I really love the format!  It's very user friendly and very informative.  I was on the website to try and find more information about bike racks at my local blue line station and everything I needed to know was there!!  There were maps of stations, routes and specific information about the kind of bike racks located at my blue line station.  That's exactly what I wanted to know!The blue line is still great (albeit under construction to do some much needed repair/replacement of tracks) and runs quickly during the rush periods.  I love the buses in this city, too.  We really have one of the best and most extensive bus systems in this country.  Have you ever been to New York?  They have like three buses and it's super annoying (sure, they have way more trains, but still).  Detroit has that one bus that sucks and who knows what is happening in L.A., but it ain't pretty.  We really take our transit system for granted and I don't really know why.  No other cities have the same kind of bus system as Chicago so suck it up and quit your complaining.  And just as a note, I'm as angry as you about fare hikes.  It seems like they continually raise fares and don't really do anything.  A lot of the money needs to go to the Brown Line overhaul because it costs way more than they ever estimated.  I wish this wasn't the case, but I'll deal.  I love our trains and buses because they get me from point A to point B quickly.  Have you ever used the bus tracker?  It's awesome!"
164,4 star rating,"Sep 12, 2008","CTA is convenient and necessary.  Aside from the occasional problems with late-ness, there's really nothing wrong with CTA.  Our trains go to a lot of convenient places and the buses even more so.  Chicago's bus system is much more extensive than the two other major cities in the U.S., so there really is a bus that goes everywhere.  The facilities are usually clean and the staff are OK to deal with.  Usually the staff in the train stations are jerks who are stunned to find out riders actually have questions or need help with something.  I've found that I just say hi to them if they're around and go on my way - that turns the experience into a pleasant one.  The bus drivers are usually much nicer, especially if you're nice to them.  They also remember you if you take the same bus everyday - it's really nice.  All in all, I've experienced the same crap as everyone else (bus doesn't come for 35 minutes, train is late because of construction, etc.) but I'd rather have the transit system that we do now than a less efficient, less-extensive one."

Usually the train has stopped because either: Someone got mugged or yet another passenger has passed out- during this time the driver will have stopped the train, with the doors open to freezing weather, litter aflutter, every half-sober passenger clutching cheap cell phones cranked up and blaring heavy static trying to emulate music, aggressive panhandlers... And it smells like a port-a-potty.Also, once a passenger dropped their groceries and the car, including me, were covered in flour. I swore. A lot. (For the record, I look little, but I was raised in a big Italian family that works primarily in law enforcement and the military. I can curse colorfully enough to make most cable TV squeamish). It definitely scared the other passengers and I was the smallest person there. Plus I looked like Lindsay Lohan on a bender- and that is simply terrifying. Boyfriend complains we do not spend enough time together. Sigh. Still, Boyfriend lives off the Green Line so I do (feel forced) take it from time to time... it ensures no one gets laid as I am inevitably, unavoidably in a foul mood when I get there."

The reason is that I just returned to my lovely hometown after living in a mass transit desert, known as the L.A. area, for what seemed like forever. So compared to that, CTA is truly outstanding. I'll take it over sitting in that horrendous, life-paralyzing traffic in L.A. ANY DAY. Even in a blizzard. Yes, even when it is pouring down rain. You know why? Because I have options! I can get to many places in the city by train, bus or a combo. AND, if I opt for an unlimited monthly pass, it amounts to under 1K a year, unlike running a car, which is 8-10K or more. For that alone, CTA is the bomb diggity. Just try doing that in L.A. NOT! Even the poorest of poor people (and there are plenty) in L.A. are riding around in gross polluting cars, getting into accidents and putting other's lives in danger, because many do not even have a driver's license, let alone insurance. No thank you. Oh, and, in case you're wondering, that is in EVERY part of the city. People of low means are driving EVERYWHERE in L.A., because you pretty much have to, if you plan on leaving where you live for any reason, like, say -- work or anything else. Yes, there are some CTA routes that are worse than others. Yes, there are delays. But I've learned to pad my time so that I get to places early or at least on time. It doesn't always work, but, hey .... most of the time I do just fine!Yes, there are some crackpots who ride mass transit. I find these folks entertaining, as long as I am not in physical danger. Here's a tip: sit in the first car, so you're near the driver, if you're squeamish. It's no guarantee, but it's a good idea, especially if it's late. Oh, and be smart about riding late at night. Better to catch a cab than worry, in some of those cases. I believe that if you can live close in along an L train, you're golden. The bus/train combo, unless it is an express, kinda sucks. When I lived 2 blocks from the Red Line I thought I'd died and gone to mass transit heaven. It was just that sublime. I could be at anywhere I needed to be in under around 1/2 hour, since I lived downtown. SCORE! I never even had to check a schedule, because even on weekends, evenings and holidays, they came every few minutes - and I do mean few. Oh, is that a train I hear coming? So what! There'll be another one in around 6 minutes - so no need to run. It just doesn't get any better than that, as far as I am concerned."
172,1 star rating,"Sep 2, 2011","I decided to write a review on CTA bus line #155 since I rely upon it heavily to get from the Loyola Red Line stop to and from home.First, this line is almost never on time. No matter what bus tracker says, either the bus is running late, with another one right behind it, or it shows up whenever. I don't expect that a bus is on time always, but this line is bordering on the ridiculous. So much so that I sent in a complaint to the CTA tonight. When this bus does finally show up - the bus stop is so full of people that you then get to ride a packed bus, while another one just sails by you, empty. In fact, I really dislike taking this bus so much that I am going to have to figure out another route for myself - along with moving closer into the city. The area this bus line serves is just too darn far. There's nothing around here - so any time I'm going to do anything, I'm looking at a minimum of 45 minutes to an hour to get to a part of the city that actually has something decent to do. Tonight, I started coming back from downtown at 8pm and did not arrive home until almost 10pm. Arrrrgggggh. This is because the thing was so late (again, with another one right behind it) - it took me nearly 2 hours to get home from downtown. That's just unacceptable.This is why I was looking for a place on the Red Line that was 4 blocks away from it or less. The apt service I used lied to me, and they rushed me through signing a lease without verifying that my needs were met. While this is my fault too, I still feel like I was blatantly lied to. I'd made it clear what I wanted, and they just didn't deliver. Live and learn.So, a word of warning: when you are shown apartments, don't sign anything until you verify that it really meets your needs in terms of transit. I wouldn't live anywhere that you have to rely upon this bus. Can you imagine waiting outside in the freezing cold 30 minutes or more? Not okay."

I have been taking it first to school, then work daily for the past six years. I've had a few near-mishaps on the Blue Line and survived a fire on the Red Line, but what occured last week makes me disgusted.My brother takes the Blue Line (Forest Park branch) to UIC where's he's a part-time Sophomore.Last Wed. afternoon he was riding in his train car, alone, around 1 pm reading his books. Two men entered his car from another through the emergency doors. This was while the train was in motion between the Oak Park and Harlem stops. The first guy threatened by brother for his wallet, or he'd ""kill him."" My brother acted too fast and punched the guy without thinking. The second came up, strangled him till he went unconsious and took only his wallet, which had no plastic and only $40 in cash.The Oak Park police found him unconsious at the Forest Park station, and he came to and had stitches done at Rush Hospital Oak Park.CTA isn't returning calls or responding to our emails. It was only an aggravated assualt and battery. Honestly, I know its a big city. There's always crime, and desperate times produce desperate acts. But can the CTA bring back the conductors from years past? At least acknowledge a crime this grave occured?I can't believe Daley now wants Huberman as the head of the CPS.

In fact, there's a Facebook page that's solely designed to show the pitfalls of this shitty option. Check out: ""People of the CTA"" on Facebook. You won't regret it.I just had a thought: homeless people that lay out newspaper on the seats are actually very, very smart. Rightly so, patrons should be laying down newspaper... especially on the Red Line.CTA listen up: they're building Divvy Bike Stands aaaaaaaaall over the city. They're placing one in front of my pad and in front of my office. You can bet your ace that I'll be using them instead of the train. I won't have to see anyone jerkin' it on my way to work anymore. If I were you, it would be your competitive prerogative to clean up the trains before more people use bikes - rates are already sky high. CTA workers definitely don't earn the money the city is shoveling out to your pensions. Have you SEEN Washington DC's subways?! They're immaculate and practically hallowed ground they're so nice. Do that, CTA.One point for well-placed stations and for going anywhere and everywhere you need to go in the city. It's well laid out."

Compact seating - people might as well sit on each other because the seating is all made for stick figures.  Don't get me started on the cleanliness of the carriages or how it is packed often with very odiferous regulars riding the train because it's warm.  Get ready to experience being a sardine in a sardine tin during most rush hours- rushing to pack oneself into a car only to have the bloody train sit for 5-10 minutes before going for 2 minutes before stopping regularly due to 'track work' or 'unforeseen' emergencies.  Don't expect to get to your destination on time.
186,2 star rating,"Jan 18, 2007","Have you ever compared the CTA to the Tube in London or a metro in virtually any other large European city?  Yes, compared to US cities, the NETWORK of trains is pretty good.  However, what good is a network of tracks when a large percentage of them are in disrepair (we're talking cracks in the metal everywhere, people, not just chipping paint) causing the trains to have to go 10mph for fear of DERAILING?  Chicago deserves MUCH better.  A great city, a world-class city as our lovely mayor points out repeatedly, should have a world-class transport system, right?  Hell, I'd settle for an ADEQUATE system.  Quick story: As a public transportation enthusiast, when I moved to Chicago 8 months ago, I was STOKED to ride the CTA to work... relaxing, efficient, eco-friendly, etc.  After the big SNAFU with the derailment downtown in early July (?) 2006 and the myriad ""slow zones"" that were added as a result, it started to take me about 10 extra minutes to get to work (previously a 15 min ride, now 25 mins).  When I realized it now takes me less than 1/2 the time to drive to work, even during rush hour, I started to commute by car.  The goal of public transportation should be to remove cars from the road, NOT to force otherwise happy customers to add them to the already bad traffic.  CTA gets two stars, only because the trains DO get people from point A to point B.  It fails to get any more stars because of the gross mismanagement of the otherwise very nice transport network imposed by the excuse-harboring, managerially incompetent, Daley-machine-appointed Frank Kreusi and the ragtag group of other inept appointees running the system into the ground.PS: from a visitor's perspective, I can see how there's much to like.  However, once you live with it every day, it becomes enraging to see cars speeding past your train at 3x the speed when you're running a little late for work, especially because simple, preventable maintenance would stop the delays."

I started getting up an hour earlier because my normal time was jam packed, and at first it was cool, but now everyone seems to have started doing that, and even the early ones are jammed.  And this morning, I waited 30 minutes for a bus that is supposed to come every 12, in -7 degree weather, and my toes literally started stinging so bad I was going to cry.

Seriously, try getting around in a driving city like Atlanta or L.A. - you'll be wishing you were on the El when you're sitting in traffic.  Coming from a city where you pretty much need to drive everywhere, the CTA was a huge boon during our car-less stay in Chicago.  I was able to go wherever I needed with relative ease and minor expense.  Travelling around the city like I did was really nice.  It also was a glaring reminder of the transit problems my own city has - trying to get around Atlanta like I did in Chicago would be impossible.  Pros- The train & bus system is large enough that you can actually get to where you want to go (please take note, Atlanta).  It seems like almost everyone uses mass transit which is pretty cool.    - It was pretty easy getting wherever I needed to go using a combination of subway and bus.  Cons- Efficiency was lacking a bit: trains just randomly stopping, delays, lights going out on the train, etc.  Atlanta trains are actually better in this regard which is pretty shocking (though ATL trains are much more limited in their usefulness).  - I wish there were more places to buy passes in the actual terminals.  Leaving the terminal to go to a grocery store to buy a transit pass seemed kind of stupid.  - Crazy people (jittery, mumbling dude yelling ""Wake me up when we play the fuckin' Yankees!"" repeatedly to no one).  I guess there are always crazy people on trains though so there's not much you can do about that.Overall, despite some operational issues, I thought the train and bus system in Chicago was pretty useful and fairly timely.  I am definitely a bit jealous.  4"

We lack that ability in Chicago.  I say this after 15 years of public transportation experience.  It used to be much better in this city. It now truly stinks.  I find it embarrasing that upon arriving at ORD, one must suffer on a dirty, jostling train ride for nearly an hour!  ONE HOUR!  Horrifying.  ""Welcome to Chicago....barring any delays, (but there will likely be a few)  we'll have you into the city proper in ONE HOUR!""The other embarrasing fact is that our system lacks access for travelers with bags or people with disabilities.  I recently helped one traveler, who mistakenly got off at the Grand stop on the Blue Line, while struggling up about 50 stairs with her large suitcase.  Not a warm welcome, to say the least.Chicago's a great city...but this experience is not a part of that greatness and, really, given that it is now minimally functioning on some lines, we should truly call a spade a spade.  2nd City (again)."

But the CTA needs to either give up or catch up with the other public transit systems in the world. I've been fortunate enough to travel and experience quite a few different systems and ours is like the ugly, stupid stepchild compared to others I've seen. The first thing that needs to change... Post train arrival times at ALL stations. Installing big flat screen tvs at some stops only to show advertisements and sports news was a giant tease and most people would agree, a huge waste of resources. Now post arrival times as well and I won't start off every morning in a foul ass mood."
196,4 star rating,"Jul 5, 2007","Normally, I love the CTA. I will get on the el and just ride around people watching when I'm basically broke and I need to get out of the house. I ride the blue line down 290 pointing at laughing at people stuck in traffic jams. I've had people shoot me the bird, and in response I usually smile and wave like the driver and I are old chums. Oh, the fun, it just don't stop.But this crap they pulled Tuesday night after the fireworks, with the els being broken, that was ridiculous. First, nobody would tell us what the problem was. Second, the workers (at least at the Quincy stop) who knew perfectly well that the trains were broken were still letting people put their cards into the turnstiles so the CTA could get their $2.Third, I don't think it was an accident. Didn't they threaten to shut down every el line except the blue and red if they didn't get funding from the state? And weren't the blue and red lines the only ones running on one of the busiest public transportation nights of the year?I don't think that's a coincidence. I think it's crap, flat out.But generally, yeah, it's a great system. $4 round trip is a hell of deal when compared to $16-$30 for parking, plus gas used sitting in traffic. The CTA has serious problems about four or five times a year, where as traffic is bad pretty much every freaking day.So get on the el, give public transportation a whirl. Ride it more often than you do now, if you can. Save money, mix among the common folk, spend some time reading the paper or staring blankly out the window.    Do something for which you can respect yourself in the morning, for crying out loud."

The echo and reverb.  The clank of wheels on pavements and tracks.  The disarray of not quite clean behemoths of metal drifting through a sea of gridlock... or wavering above it on the L.I went back to a place where I ran from over 10 years ago last weekend.  I went to discover some answers.  So much of what I found on that trip was myself, even though I was visiting someone.A love affair started in that busy quiet of babbling bums, parkas, cold hands, and moonlit dances as a pair of commuters (one nerdy gimpy punk and one colorful eskimo clad Californian) guided with ease to bus after bus to train.There was beauty in that quiet.  Of finally having the time to just sit down and relax.  To cuddle close and be together.  To read.  To write. To observe the city and people watch.  To enjoy the silence and become enveloped in the sounds around you.He has so much love for his city.  As stop after stop would go by, he would tell me tales of the fabled city, both forgotten and adored.  ""They changed this when you get to these stops.  On Grand and Chicago, it used to say ""This is Grand."" ""This is Chicago.""I listened attentively.  I devoured every morsel of history and knowledge this man had to offer about this city that I had never had the privilege of calling home once upon a decade ago.And the sun shined down on both of them.  And they smiled.The love affair was the city.  The love was with the transit.  And then I went back to Los Angeles and saw more and more that something was missing.  And while he's a swell cat that I adore, I'm not just referring to him.  It was the ability to effortlessly get anywhere within the city that I wanted to go without ever having to deal with a car or even a motorcycle.  Los Angeles is decades away from this.And I thought about my dad and how much he would complain about the commute through the city.  Through this city and out in LA too.  But now I truly believe that he might have just been saying those things to protect me.  There's a reason why there's that plastic divider between the drivers.  And the smell of urine isn't exactly something a father would probably want his daughter dealing with on her daily commute through the paper skyscrapers.  Who knows if this will be the day that chatty bum will finally truly go crazy and lash out at someone.A love affair started in that busy quiet of babbling bums, parkas, cold hands, and moonlit dances as a pair of commuters (one nerdy gimpy punk and one colorful eskimo clad Californian) guided with ease to bus after bus to train.There was beauty in that quiet.

A turnstile at Clarka nd Lake stole my link up card. I was late to work because I had to file paperwork to get another one sent to me in the mail which stil has not arrived, 1 week later. The $20 replacement card is out of money. Employees at Washington and Wells are jerks. Trains are late. Trains are sometimes mis-labeled or not labeled at all. Maps are often missing.The blue line smells like pee. ALL THE TIME. (Way to impress tourists coming out of O'Hare, Chicago. Well done.Purple line is unreliable and runs 15-20 minutes between trains.

For the average Yelp demographic this takes us a little out of our comfort zone/territory since it does pass through some rough areas, and often the people on board can be a source of anxiety.  The panhandlers are more aggressive (one has been written up in the Tribune for his numerous arrests related to this) and there is a pretty high rate of snatch-and-run crimes.  In fact I rode it again yesterday and a hapless young lady lost her phone just this way; the CTA employees yelled at her not to run after but she didn't listen, this stopped the train for a bit.    There is a little of this on the El everywhere but it just seems more concentrated here.  Otherwise the service on the train is pretty standard and its not any dirtier or cleaner than any other trains that I can see.

And as far as transit systems go it's always worked quite well for my needs. I prefer the Red Line as that takes me to Wrigleyville and places where I have fun, the Orange Line and Blue Line are what always take me home or send me on my way elsewhere. I've only had one issue with a ticket machine in all the years I've used the CTA. I love being able to order Transit Cards online, and the bottom line is when I board a CTA train for the most part I know it's going to get me where I need to be.

203,4 star rating,"Mar 29, 2012","This review is for rail service, Blue, Red, and Orange Lines. The CTA is my preferred way to get from Midway / O'Hare to the loop. Access from Midway to the Orange Line is a breeze, and once you find the station at O'Hare the ride to downtown is fast. When you look out the windows at the traffic parked on the Kennedy you'll be thinking your ticket is a sweet deal. The Red Line takes me to Cubs games and to many of the places I like to go in Chicago...and it's my favorite line to ride. For someone from out of town riding the CTA late at night can be...well...interesting. It's also great for people watching....ever seen flight attendants put on makeup as a train car is rocking back and forth at 50 mph at 4 am? I have, and they always look good when they get off onto the platform. In 15+ years of going to Chicago and riding the L I have always felt safe on the trains. When you get off the train and leave the platforms that can be little interesting depending on where you are but I've never had any issues on the trains especially coming or going to the airports.Tip: Passes / Unlimited Ride Cards are the ONLY way to go if you're going to make more than 1 ride on the CTA. $5.75 for one day, $14 for 3 Days. Tip: For Android Phones download the Chicago Transit Tracker App. I've tried the other apps CTA recommends but this is the one I keep coming back to."

My husband and I used the Blue Line to get out to the Allstate Arena to meet our friends for a Chicago Wolves game.  Our friends advised us to allow extra time, telling us to add about 30 minutes to the time we estimated to get out there.  That, and the ""L"" doesn't serve the Arena directly.  One has to get off at Rosemont to change to a bus.If you are staying Downtown (or near Downtown) however, you can't beat the CTA for getting around.  We stayed at the Ambassador East,  and while it was a bit of a walk to the Red Line, the buses on nearby Local Lake Shore Drive went directly to Michigan Avenue, the Loop, and the Museums.  The CTA does sell visitor passes, which allow for unlimited rides.  They are also useful if you live in Chicago and plan on doing extensive riding for a day or two."
209,5 star rating,"Dec 23, 2008","In no other city that I have lived or visited have the trains and many of the bus lines run 24 hours a day. In other cities, trains cost you based on the distance you travel, often ending up in $7 fares.I'll take $2, or even $2.25, and all night service, over any of that.While it's not 100% reliable, no public transit system in a city the size of Chicago can be. Plus, with the slow zones reduced to tiny bits of track, the Blue line is like the Zoom line now.CTA, I love you."
210,5 star rating,"Oct 16, 2012","I can appreciate a good public transit system when I ride one!  CTA was reliable, efficient, EASY TO NAVIGATE, and GENERALLY, clean!  As a recent Chicago city tourist, I was able to take CTA easily from the airport to my downtown location, and then ALL AROUND the city.  All the lines are colored differently and so it makes it so easy to navigate and ask around for directions.  It actually reminded me of the monopoly board... it literally had all the colors, brown, pink, red, blue, green, ect. There's also something I love about taking public transit... Just the feeling of hopping onto a bus/subway, through all the hustle & bustle of life... and you literally see all different kinds of people walk on and out.  I'll stop there before I get too philosophical... lol! But I appreciate the moment when you can just people watch and take a moment to collect your thoughts before you continue on with your day... : )TIP: 3 day pass is $14 and it lasts for 72 hours from first use.  For all google map phone users, it has EXCELLENT/ACCURATE directions!"

I actually thought the buses were the best part - the train schedule is kinda inconsistent depending on where you are. Would hate to drive in this city. Yay cta

213,2 star rating,"Mar 28, 2007","The trains are noisy.  Very noisy.  When underground, the hiss is deafening... moreso than any other public transportation system I've ridden on.There is ALWAYS a delay on the trains.  ALWAYS.  Seriously... no matter how often they work on the track, it always seems to be mucked up.  ALWAYS.  How is that possible?  For all the time they spend working on it you'd think it would actually, you know, be working once in a while.  But no.  And it's just gonna get worse whatwith the improvements (which are needed, so... meh).Do you need to use an elevator?  Tough.  Most stations don't have one... and those that do, well... you have a 50/50 chance of the elevator's actually working.  Sorry.  Of course, that's one of the ""improvements"" they're making... so kudos.  We'll see how that goes, now won't we?The buses are ALWAYS late.  ALWAYS.  I've waited for buses for half and hour without seeing one going in EITHER direction and finally decided to walk.  About 20 minutes into my walk I saw 4 (!!!) in a row pass in the other direction (never did see one going in my direction during the 45 minute walk).  And events like this aren't rare... not at all.The trains and buses are VERY dirty.  For the $2 each way they charge (more expensive than most other cities, even cities with higher property/upkeep costs, and about the same as New York, which has MUCH higher property/upkeep costs), you get to sit in trash.  And if you're from Boston or San Francisco and used to bringing your dog on the train/bus with you... forget about it.  That's the one rule they DO enforce (I E-mailed them about it - their excuse was that they were weary of the clean-up costs... wtf???  It's not like they clean anyway).All public transportation systems have problems... but Chicago's is REALLY bad.  Hopefully it will get better... I'm giving 2 stars just because apparently they're (finally) trying to address the problems and make improvements (though it's just gonna be eve worse for a few years while they do so).  Oh... and the trains run late (often until 2am or so), which is rad, and major props for that.  *note: I realise no public transportation system is clean... but gripe is that they overcharge for the luxury of not cleaning, then turn around and use the argument of ""extra cleaning"" as a scapegoat for not allowing dogs."

Didn't notice it until 5 p.m. Promptly spent 45 minutes looking through every pocket (several times) and everywhere else I might have stowed it. After concluding it was gone, I went online to cancel the missing card and request a new one. That only took a couple of clicks. Then I had to choose whether I wanted the new card mailed to me, or whether I'd pick it up at ""CTA headquarters"" (where it would be available ""immediately"" - albeit during business hours - fair enough). I chose to pick it up at the CTA headquarters which is two blocks from the Ogilvie Transportation Center.  While there was no CTA signage on the outside of the building, the neon buses and el trains in the lobby confirmed I'd found the right place. Up the stairs to the second floor, and in three minutes I was on my way with a replacement card and a kind word from the very helpful clerk. Thanks."
215,5 star rating,"Jul 7, 2010","On one of the busiest weekends in Chicago, I happily never encountered one single problem with the CTA. In the past I'd seen stampedes, trains breaking down and causing massive delays in subways and long lines of angry people waiting for buses that never show up on time. 4th of July weekend was hectic and crowded but it looks like enough people had enough sense to think ahead of time and buy their transit cards ahead of time so there was hardly any clogs in the system that weekend. I appreciate the facelifts some of the stations have gone under, the lack of urine on the subway stairs-especially the Chicago and State red line stop and electronic updates.A great thing about the CTA is that it's still only $2.25 to hop on a train and get from one length of the city to the other. When you tell someone from the bay area it's $2.25 to get from Howard to downtown, it's a massive relief to not pay upwards of $20 for one train ride. The amount spent on public transportation for the 5 days spent in Chicago cost the same for a BART ride from downtown to the airport."
216,4 star rating,"Jul 25, 2011","I look at some of the reviews of the CTA.  Let me say this: Columbus, Cincinnati, and Indianapolis are good, nice cities.Chicago, however, is a GREAT city.  Why?  The CTA.  I envy Chicago because of the good, strong public transportation available to residents, suburbanites, and visitors alike.  Chicago, because it is a big city with much of the troubles and seedy element of any city, has some interesting people who ride it.  People who smell.  Are drunk.  Sometimes even those who will drink while riding on the 'L'.  But guess what, it's PUBLIC transportation!  And there are many well-behaved, bathed, civil and well-dressed (and good-looking) people who ride the trains and buses throughout the city.Transit in Chicago has always been rough, and the CTA, according to history, as seen MUCH WORSE days.  But they have upgraded stations, vehicles, rail cars, and track to keep a good level of service, and keep and attract residents and business, and oh so many visitors, giving them affordable (and fun) ways to move throughout the city, whether they flew into Midway of O'Hare, took Amtrak, or drove into town.""L"" Service is frequent throughout the day, and on weekends as well.  Evening service is not bad.  Red and Blue lines? 24 hour sevice!  Bus routes are also plentiful, some of them running late/overnight (I think) and fairly frequent.  Chicago has invested greatly in its transit infrastructure: it shows, and other midwest cities could learn a few lessons here...Chicago Transit Authority.  Why Chicago is not like Cincinnati,  Or St. Louis.  And especially Detroit!"

I've reviewed Metra and Pace, now here I am reviewing CTA. The best way for me to do it is to list what I like and what I don't like about CTA.My likes:Small faresService 24/7/365 or 366Plenty of bus routes inundating the whole city5000-series cars on trainsRock in Cumberland terminalThomas Jefferson statue at Jefferson Park terminalClark/Lake L stationDrunks are not allowed to board the busesTakes me to many destinations24/7/365 or 366 train serviceEasy to use, in comparison to NYC's subway system which is equateable to a bowl of spaghetti (no, seriously)Purple, Orange, and Brown L linesNow, my dislikes:Criminals are allowed to use CTAVery little securityHomeless people that never used soap and water in their lives are allowed to use CTA buses/trainsHomeless people and drunks peeing and defecating on buses and trains and at stations/terminalsTrains and buses don't go very far into Metra/Pace territory (in other words, the suburbs) expand the Blue Line to Schaumburg, preferably Woodfield or Northwest Transportation Center, please!Train elevators forever smell like pissSoliciting runs rampant on Red LineFar too many ghetto people ridingAttitude of a good clump of CTA employees is just absolutely freakin' warped and twistedI love pigeons, sparrows, starlings, and robins, but CTA doesn't bother cleaning up their poop on station/terminal platforms. What? You want me to do it? Okay, give me the supplies I need to do so!Looks like I have more dislikes regarding the CTA than likes, but overall, I love this transit system and I will be damned, literally, if it along with Pace and Metra disappear completely. Cars cost too freakin' much to maintain. Oh thank God for public transit, something I never have and never will, take for granted."

It runs through the most crime/drug/gang-infested neighborhoods in all of Chicago and that's why it experiences so many problems in terms of crime and negative incidents. I've read online from many riders who have been robbed or assaulted or saw fights on the train while riding the Green Line, and that was enough to make me reluctant to get on a train to go somewhere.The only good thing about the Green Line trains is that they usually run on time and run often, but other than that, I'm taking the Blue or even the Red Line, and definitely the Orange Line, to get to wherever I'm going, for safety's sake."
223,4 star rating,"Jun 29, 2009","Ok, CTA employees restored my faith in humanity.....  I am a flight attendant, and I take the good, OLE blue line to and from O'hare to my home in the loop.  The Dearborn Street subway construction is getting really really old.  Last week, I was stuck on the train at Grand because there was a one track operation at Clark and Lake, because of said construction.  we were at Grand for almost 30 minutes while we had to wait for O'hare bound trains to clear.  That's all well and good, and I, of all people, understand about delays, ect.  But after 30 minutes of sitting there, I REALLY had to ""powder my nose!""  I walked off of the train and headed to the first car where the train operator was, and asked him how much longer we would be sitting here.  He smiled and politely told me the situation, and that we would be waiting for at least 2 more O'hare trains to pass before we would be able to move.  I asked him if there was any way that I could use the restroom upstairs.  He then tried to find the supervisor to see if I could, but he had just disappeared down the tracks. He told me that I had plenty of time to go and come back and the train would be still sitting at the station.  He then told me to go up and tell the security guy that the conductor said I could use the bathroom at the station.  I thanked him and ran up top.The security guy wouldn't let me use the station bathroom, but he told me what restaurant I could go to and use theirs, and he promised to let me back in when I came back.  Skeptical, but desperate, I followed his advice and off I went.  When I came back, he DID remember me, and let me back down, and the train was STILL sitting there.  I hopped back on the train in my same seat, and not 2 minutes later we FINALLY on our way.Now I am sure the operator was getting bombarded with angry people wanting to know how much longer, long before I asked him myself.  The fact that he calmly, and politely answered my questions and request impressed me.  The fact that the security guy could have been a complete jerk and not let me back down to the train again, but didn't impressed me too.  They didn't have to help me as much as they did, but the fact that they did.  I wish the CTA had more employees like these."

I have no problem with raising fares if the increase is used to improve the infrastructure and overall service is improved, not the CEOs wallets getting fatter.And what's up with doing away with the Chicago Card plus bonus for putting $20 at a time on it?  What's the point now, I might as well pay cash.  It's not like I can go with another mass transit system in Chicago.  In Paris, a one way ticket costs about 1.90 USD each way, but if you buy 10 tickets at once you get  a huge price break.  10 tickets are 10 euros or about $13.50 .  Ten rides on the CTA is double that, and the service is a fraction of what the Metro in Paris is!"

The buses are ok.  I had to take one today and was a little surprised that the reroutes for the chicago marathon weren't posted.  This was particularly an issue because the neighborhood where I was (along the 29 state line) seemed pretty dependent on the bus and a lot of little old people were forced to walk blocks and blocks and blocks.  Then when we got closer to my stop, I was listening, but didn't know the route.  In DC, at least, the voice announces the next stop.  Well I pulled the stop request as she was announcing it - only for the driver to miss the stop and chide me for not giving him enough time.  Metro bus, it;s not"

I can buy passes at my Blue Line stop, at either of the closest grocery stores, or the Currency Exchange down the street. I have the internet and a credit card, so I can even order a Chicago Card delivered right to my door with no hassle at all. This summer, I took the bus or the train with my students every day. My students are from the real west side, and things weren't so easy for them. To get permits to use their reduced fare passes, they would have needed phone access, a guardian with the time and mobility to find, fill out and submit applications, two dollars, and an address for the permits to be sent to. At least two of those things would have proved insuperable obstacles to most of the children, and they would have spent the summer either indoors or unsupervised. Neither of those options are all that much fun. Chicago summers are amazing because of how many free, fun things happen every day - look at the Millennium Park schedule, the events happening at the library, the beaches, movies in the parks, all the different cultural festivals - but in order to take advantage of these opportunities, you need to use the CTA. We ended up getting passes for all the kids, but no permits. The real reason my students and I had such a wonderful summer was that CTA stations are staffed by human beings. No individual is going to tell a group of schoolkids that they can't go play on the beach with their teachers. I felt bad for putting CTA employees in that position, but I also felt angry that CTA itself made it so incredibly difficult for us to follow the letter of the law."

The CTA is light years ahead of the SF Bay Area in Public transit. I hold the NYC Metro as the bar and after traveling all over the world, the subway runs all night, gets you just about anywhere, and is still fairly affordable. For me to go from my house and get around various places in SF I have to get on at least 2-3 different systems. That is ass. So CTA seems to get you to a ton of places for fairly cheap and with lots of locales. I thought the bus and EL  were fairly pleasant. Case in point, the bus couldnt take my $5 bill so the driver nicely said go ahead and sit down. He even gave me directions for where I was going. In SF the driver would just mumble and brush you off."

You would be wrong.I don't believe that public transport should be privatized, and the CTA is a clear example of why not.  If something is subsidized by government money, it should have to meet government standards, which (if they were to exist..) may prohibit exploiting minority populated areas, catering to more wealthy districts, and oh i don't know,  filling with smoke every now and again.The people who work for the cta have a lot to deal with and by no means is this problem theirs to bear. Raising the fare is maybe the only way to pay the staff a fair wage, and i understand this...but perhaps if money hadn't been mismanaged and quick fixes used for so long we wouldn't be paying for it now. Raising fares, more advertisements, and a gift shop? then why is there a DECREASE in service?p.s. the cta's scam where you HAVE to buy a u-pass unless you are disabled is insane.

If Chicago didn't lose so much money to corruption, we may not have to wrangle with Illinois government for extra money.  I think taking on the olympics may be a bad idea.  I don't blame Daley alone, I blame all of em, the whole croney driven machine.  But the truth is the city wouldn't work without the CTA.  Imagine how nice it would be if it were well funded and well run?"

I felt safe, I was usually travelling with another person, but even on solo trips things were not overly shady.   I felt the announcements were easy to understand also.  I rode out to Midway, not knowing that it has a bad reputation, and it was the middle of the day so perhaps that makes a difference, no problems.Employees mostly  helpful, sometimes low on patience/energy, but if I had their job of dealing with people all the d*&% day I think I'd feel the same.p.s.  My friend who moved to Chicago from NYC had this to say concerning the people who come on the trains asking for money in the two places- in NYC there is more music etc and trying to entertain passengers, while in the midwest it's more like here's my sob story.  Yes, we know life can suck really fast for many people and you never know what could happen and it could happen to you!  For example, in Chicago we were riding the brown or red line, guy comes on and has major sores on his foot due to some infection.  He proceeds to tell the entire car, ""I'm only trying to raise 19$ for some medication for my foot.""  He didn't have insurance, but then again...neither do I.  p.p.s  This story has a happy ending, I hope.  There was a person riding in our car who told the guy that he worked at a hospital and to come to that hospital between certain hours and to ask for him and he'd get him a card so that he could get his medication or get some kind of health card.  Sounds promising, and one lady gave him some money.  I was not that lady, alas my conscious is not clear, but my heart is  like ice."

This, in part, was due to the fact that it was a holiday weekend and the train was not crowded at all.  Also, it was super hot outside so the air conditioning was a big relief.  Also, it was very easy to get to the Loop and there are several stops you can get off at once you get to the Loop.I highly doubt I'll be as lucky to ride the train like that again, but overall, good experience.I'm not a big fan on the EL - I'm a suburbanite and take the Metra into the city, but if I have to take the EL then I will.Also, I highly recommend buying a day pass sold at Walgreens if you are visiting.  It makes getting on the train a lot easier if you already have a ticket."

I went to visit my very best girl friend over Labor Day weekend and I was impressed by the El system. The price is good (2.00!), it is easy to get places (airport, the loop, Wrigley Field, breakfast), and I LOVE how there is only ONE system! I love my San Francisco Muni system, but it has never made ANY sense to me why we have Muni for in the city and Bart for the outer bays and airport, just make ONE system! The ""old"" feel to the El in a city that looks very much ""new"" is one of the visual pluses in my book! The tracks remind me of the Disneyland train ride- this may or may not be a plus for everyone, but it is for me and it is my review. All and all- I LOVE Chicago.

My expedition was half way over when I arrived at Roosevelt Rd. and State St.  Only to climb down the subway stairs to find a handwritten note ""no NB service"".  I waited with some others on the elevated platform for another half hour only to get frustrated.

I would probably venture on it again just because it is awesome that they have public transit and you can go all over on it if you know what the hell you are doing.  Me and three other ladies did indeed make it from our hotel out in the burbs to downtown Chicago with relative ease....We made it home too which I must say was not a smart move on our part.  Three ladies from the midwest cornfields of MN have no damn business on the public transit at 3 in the morning on a weekend.  It got a little dicey a few times and I had secretly been cussing myself out for not taking a cab.....But hey we did make it.  You will see some shit out there ---mental people walking around with urine and vomit on them talking to themselves and some thugs hanging out that look like they want to stab you.....If it isn't dark take it ---if you are bad-ass go ahead and take it.

259,3 star rating,"Nov 14, 2006","My #66 route is hit or miss.  I love the rare times that I get the real feisty bus driver that likes to blow the red lights and honk at everybody.  Basically I don't feel like I'm making good time unless I'm being sloshed back and forth from fast braking action.  I get lucky with that type of driver once a week.  Most of the time I get stuck with the bus driver that is ahead of schedule and will deliberately take as long as possible to get to my destination.  I have been on buses were the bus driver will just idle at a several lights for more than 5 minutes...for no apparent reason...aside from the fact that I am now LATE.I think my biggest complaint would not be the CTA themselves but the horrid and foul-mouthed high school students that can be found at the back of the bus in the morning.  Those kids really need to find some other type of transportation, they ruin everybody's morning commute with their dopey ass antics and lame wisecracks.  OO burn you just made fun of my coach loafers that look like ""hush puppy shoes"" and pointed out the fact that I'm drinking a beverage, out of a cup, no less.  Stay in school jabronies but find a different way to get there or one of these days my so called ""looks like she is drinking a latte"" will be all over your face."

I also loved being able to buy a all day pass for just $5. And the machine took my debit card which was the best part! The CTA Blue and Brown lines were the ones we primarily stuck to and we enjoyed using both of them. We will definitely be using the CTA transit system next time er return to Chicago.

From the point of view of a business traveler~CTA is MUCH quicker and efficient compares to the buses~ And just $20.00, you can ride however and wherever you want  for 7 Days! with all public transportations. In the bittering Chicago weather condition, some station even provides cozy services of the ""Warming Zone""How does that work? Well, with a semi open space, there will be several heating lights ready to heat you up, at the press of button. Still~ nothing beats the bittering wind of Chicago!"
262,3 star rating,"Apr 3, 2008","The CTA is a hit or miss, usually. Lately I seem to find myself muttering ""The CTA is trying to ruin my life"" quite a bit. I live at around 300 S., and work around 650 N., which on a nice day, with lots of time to spare, is a nice walk, but when its raining/snowing out and I'm running late for work, I need some sort of transportation quicker than my feet to get me there. Or when I'm tired after a long day of work, or it's really late out, I don't want to walk home. The 29 bus NEVER comes when I need it to, or it'll just drive past me. Happened a few times now. The 36 is pretty good, minus the driver that tried to kidnap me the other night, threatened to beat up the 'boyfriend' I made up as an excuse not to give him my phone number, asked if he could ""keep me"" and wouldn't open the bus doors for me to get off. The Red line has trouble being consistently underground, and seems to always NOT be running underground in the direction that I want to take it. However, I must admit it has been fairly consistent and quick getting me to work on time, and I havent had much of a wait at that station. Just watch all that change now that I wrote about it. Love my UPass, dont know what I'll do without it over summer.Some of the stations are pretty dirty and sketchy (ie: Grand), but I can tell they are really trying to fix some of them up (ie: belmont red/brown and Harrison Red). I also wish they would improve security so I would be a little more comfortable riding the train alone after work, etc.I complain about it, but I really don't know what I would do without the CTA."

I've been riding the CTA for over 20 years. And it has never been pleasant, clean or on time. I mean ONCE in a while, they'll run their shiny new buses through the nicer more influential areas of Chicago, but it always buckles in quality eventually.I've been to many cities throughout the world and most cities, even post war-torn cities, have managed to build more efficient, clean and timely transit systems. I simply don't know why we can't get it together. Its not like we don't know winter is coming, its not like the streets are rearranging themselves like in the movie The Cube and its not like the transit habits of Chicagoans change all that drastically save for a festival or two in the summer and a sudden blizzard in the winter.CTA, I simply can't stand you.

I am incredibly jealous of what you guys have over in Chicago. I've been to Chicago 4 or 5 times, even lived there for 2 months. The CTA and Metra systems can move you around so effectively it can make you feel like you'll never need or want a car again. Seriously, I don't get why they get a bad name but CTA rocks. I'm not saying its perfect, I mean, anyone ever sit on the Red line on the North Side for like 20 minutes not knowing why the hell the train stopped? But that's part of life in this city just enjoy it, leave early, and meet someone cool or interesting on the train....All while doing your part to stop global warming! :)"

Does anyone else think it's interesting they're bringing this issue up around election time? Maybe that's just me but I hope not cos my poor ass can't afford it.Anyhow for the most part I am satisfied with the service. Although there are a few drivers on the 84 Peterson who drive like they're the getaway car in a heist movie.And then there are the times where my friends and I like to refer to them as C**&^ Taking it up the A*^^ when the bus is over an hour late  and 4 going the opposite way have passed you. Still I can't hate them too much since I don't consider biking during the winter and too poor to consider cabs on a regular basis.
266,2 star rating,"Sep 12, 2008","I want to love CTA... and I try to meet it half way, but it lets me down.Chicago makes it easier to travel at later/earlier hours of the day, but they don't make the ride itself very efficient or understandable. Coming from Minnesota, we have a smaller area to work with in the Twin Cities and it is a lot harder to get lost. Plus, there is the whole Minnesota nice that goes along with the drivers. Can't seem to find that here.During the past eight years I have been riding the L and haven't had too many problems. About two years ago I was trying to go North to South on the Red Line. The train was half an hour late, so we froze in the Chicago winter. When we finally got on the train it took us forever to get to our destination. They stopped the train for over half an hour because of construction. This happened to me another time trying to go from Midway to O'Hare. Not the best feeling in the world.Like I said, most of my problem is with the website. They make it easy to find your destination on the map; however, they make the process of getting there more complicated than it should be. I can't count how many times they've told me to take the Metra to Blue Line to a bus and walk when it would have cost less and taken less time to just take the Metra all the way downtown. Then, when you want to take a bus, they give you the intersection, but don't mention which side of the street or the direction that you need. For someone not from the area, it can get confusing.Back to the whole Minnesota nice. Too bad it isn't Midwest nice. It clearly didn't migrate south. Some of the CTA drivers are rude as hell. I was trying to get from Des Plaines to the nearest Target. I waited directly under the bus stop sign. Then the driver pulls up and snaps at me, ""You need to give me a signal or something. There are a lot of buses that stop here."" I said, ""OK..."" What the hell? I'm under the friggin' sign, isn't that enough? Then I pulled the chord to get off and asked which way to walk to the shopping center. She gives me some attitude about ""we ain't there yet.."" That wasn't my question. I had the same woman on the way back home. We were waiting for the Metra to pass, so I walked to the front to be able to see where my stop was. I pulled the chord for the NEXT STOP and she's like, ""This isn't a stop. You could at least wait until we're past the tracks."" What the hell do you say to that? I'm not from here, sorry."

I mean, it seems to fit... people piss and shit in them so why not clean it out as such? I lived briefly in Chicago and thought I was so damn cool for always riding around on these piss trains. My light pink Calvin Klein puffy coat eventually turned brown after a month of riding. Taking the train from Jefferson Park to Damen would ensure I'd at least exit with some dirt under my nails but still, I was true to you. True to you despite the fact that your trains and buses came inconsistently, sometimes one after another, sometimes a 40 minute gap in between. I also hated your outside platforms. WOOD?! How about I just break my neck now to avoid slipping on your wet platform later. I recently headed back to Chicago and we took the ""L"" from O'Hare of Clark/Lake. You can smell the trains from baggage claim. I about puked when I entered and swore I sat in piss. Upon exiting at Clark/Lake, there are helpful signs indicating which way to head for one of the multiple transfer trains. CTA, you need to improve. Where CTA wins kudos: You run 24 hours a day. Way to help the homeless stay warm in the harsh winters!! Cheaper than DC metro. You can buy a monthly pass and it's a flat rate no matter how far you go. Easy to follow bus routes."

It is dirty, often graffiti-ridden, late more than on-time and there are never enough buses on Cubs game days (if you've ever ridden a jam-packed bus with suburban, drunk Cubs fans, you know what I'm talking about).  I am grateful I do not have to rely on a car and for my daily 6:55 AM bus driver on the X80.Yes its money is limited and yes changes are being made.  But it seems too little too late.

I'm not sure if this paratransit service is still offered through CTA, or if it was transferred to Pace.  In any case, this is another great service.  While I never used it, my father depended on it to get to work every morning.  The drivers were very nice and polite.The busses...  One of the worst things about the CTA... the crappy service.  CTA busses tend to be very over crowded, always run late (the schedule is a joke), and like to break down because they are old and poorly maintained.  On the other hand, the drivers are overall good people (ok, there are a very small number of assholes, but in 6 years of taking CTA, I've only encountered 2) and do their best.RTA route planner... This service, offered through the CTA web page attempts to give directions.  Its an ok service, but some of the suggested routes suck.

283,3 star rating,"Nov 25, 2007","I really want to say four stars because I've had a good experience using the train and the bus, but their inconsistencies really piss me off. I don't even know why they post a bus ""schedule"" online when it is completely unreliable and you could be standing outside in the cold for 30 minutes or more before you see the bus you're trying to catch.In particular the Milwaukee bus I take to and from work is never on time when it's supposed to be, and you just have to take a guess as to when it might be there and go outside and wait. They really need to get it together and figure out a better way to get the buses running.That being said, they are usually clean and I haven't had too many grouchy bus drivers, and I take the blue line to and from O'Hare and that's no problem. It was annoying that when they are working on the slow spots that you have to get off, take a bus to the next station, and then get back on the train... but if in the end it means the train will go quicker, then it will be all worth it, I guess."

I love the idea that we are all working together to make sure that this person gets their kid to their doctor's appointment on time, that person gets to their friend's birthday party, and that other person can get to work, all safely and inexpensively.  I love the occasional crazy person on the train (yes, lady who claims that she was on Diana Ross's high school swim team, I am talking to you!), and the friendly bus drivers (hey, I've never encountered a rude one, and I find that the bus drivers really appreciate a nice ""good morning"" or ""have a nice weekend"".  Try it.)However...CTA, what are you doing to me???  I can't use the Brown Line for the next 2 years, because it is so hit and miss, and now I can't depend on the Clark bus to come and pick me up in a timely manner!  I waited for 40 minutes the other day for a bus!  Come on!CTA, I appreciate the hard work that you do, but straighten out please.  Your 4 star rating has now dropped to a 3 star rating..."
285,2 star rating,"Oct 23, 2007","holy crap...it took almost 3 times as long to get to work this morning, i HATE the CTA...This morning alone made me get on here just to bash them.I leave at the same time for work EVERYDAY,  i just don't understand how some times the trains are totally jammed and you cant even squeeze in...and other times they are totally empty. It cant be that THAT many more people are riding on certain days...My Theory: I think they have some drivers call in sick and just run less trains some days, leaving us, the paying public, to jam onto them.Today it was a MORE than packed day, to the point i barely got on the 2nd Red line train that went by at the Addison stop. I decided to push and squeezed on to that one bc i knew, in one stop i would have to get off...and transfer to the brown, which ::crossed fingers:: wouldn't be as packed. Well the problem wasn't that that it was packed, its that it decided to NOT SHOW....THREE red line trains went by before a brown. Each packed Red dropping off MORE people to squeeze on to Brown train that is coming 1/3 less times. Frustrated i wouldn't get on a Brown....I reluctantly decided to hop back on the Red.BAD IDEA-  the RED decided to run at like 4 mph the whole way...it had hit 8:30...when i needed to be at work.. i was underground and had no reception, so i couldn't call in. I didn't get off  at Monroe/State until almost 9..and then had to walk 10min to work (instead of the around the corner ...if i took the brown)...so here i am, showing up 35min late.  I am pissed....crap!They REALLY need to get their sh*t straight for the morning commutes."

287,3 star rating,"Dec 2, 2007","Believe me....there are days where I would give the CTA NO stars! Like the time it took me almost 1.5 hours to get home (only 5 miles-and only 15 minutes by car) and then I ended up having to walk the last half mile and it started to sleet on me on the walk home!!But MOST of the time you can get anywhere in the city within an hour. Whether its 2 miles or 12 miles it still usually takes an hour-I know, it mystifies me too but I've grown to accept it.Again, I repeat-MOST of the time. My husband and I only have one car, so for 5 years I've relied on the CTA to get me to work, doctors appointments, school, and much more.... Although I will acknowledge that it's gotten a little ridiculous with all the ""doomsday"" service cuts threats, the fare hikes, etc. I am still grateful the CTA exists and can get me around the city fairly reliably. I've had close friends who have seen violence on the train, I've witnessed masturbation, defecation and urination and obviously experienced solicitation from homeless people and been subject to funky spills (vomit, anyone?) as well as smells. But what 24-hour service that goes ALL over the LARGE and DIVERSE city wouldn't have some of these issues....I try to cut slack where slack is due!Edit (4/22): Yes, I was one of those stuck underground in the blue-line mess last week. Yes, it sucked. No, I'm not afraid of taking the blue line or subway now. Personally, it was more comical than scary and my train conductor was great with letting us know what was going on and helping to lighten the situation. I still think the CTA needs some significant improvements, but people-it could be MUCH worse."
288,3 star rating,"Oct 19, 2009","Background: I used to work in city/transit planning in NYC. The CTA, in my opinion, seems like an eager organization (as far as transit operators go) and does a decent job with their limited resources. They are generally pretty friendly, and they clearly put effort into customer service initiatives like Bus Tracker, the crisp automated announcements, and the hoards of customer service reps when they have service changes. American city dwellers in general *love* to complain that America's metros don't run like their European counterparts, but nobody wants to put their money where their mouth is. Take Paris, a city that is roughly the same size (slightly smaller city, slightly larger metro area). The RATP gets $10 billion a year from the government to operate the rapid transit system, while the CTA gets less than 1/7th of that to work with. So if we'd like to increase CTA's operating budget by 750%, I'm sure we too could have pretty stations, shiny new trains, and new lines being built. (In fact, that would be a great thing!) Or, you could pay $8 for a one-way ticket on London's (semi) privatized Underground. That said, I find riding the quirky 'L' to be kind of awesome, kind of like a low-intensity roller coaster ride with great views. The 'L' needs serious expansion, and misses enormous swaths of the city. The CTA really ought to reconsider its line extensions on the Orange and Red and put those efforts into things like the Circle Line to create better interurban connections. Chicago is too spread out already--development should encourage density in the core, not push it even further out.Oh. The farecard vending machines are horrendous."
289,1 star rating,"Apr 9, 2015",Passengers beware - it seems that CTA has allowed the blue line  from  O'Hara to turn into a homeless shelter.  This morning @ around 8 am there were  at least 8 homeless men sleeping under blankets in one car.  No effort was made to remove them - Unsafe!!
290,2 star rating,"Jun 5, 2009","Though this is the only source of transporation that gets me around Chicago, it is an unreliable and expensive method transporation that is simply unpleasant. CTA trains called the ""L"" are expensive to ride. It costs $2 to ride the bus and $2.25 to ride the train. It is also unreliable in that you never really know when the bus or train is going to arrive. There is a set schedule for arrival times, but the trains never really seem to follow it. The trains are consistently experiencing delays. Many times I have been sitting on the train and the conductor comes on the intercom to once again apologize for the inconvenience and notify us that the train is experiencing technical difficulties. I understand if there are temporary difficulties, but difficulties almost everyday is unacceptable. I sit in the unmoving stopped train car for 10 minutes knowing that this will happen again tomorrow. The buses on the other hand are much more reliable time wise. Other than cost and reliability, the ""L"" is very dirty. The tunnel at Jackson connecting the Red and Blue line smells like urine. They are constantly using chlorine to wash the tunnel floors, but even chlorine cannot cover the unbearable stench. Whenever I have to make the trek across the tunnel I hold my breath walking as fast as I can. Also some of the north side train stops have very little standing room. It is quite scary waiting for the train at those stops, because it seems so easy to fall right into the tracks. Riding the ""L"" is an unpleasant experience and if I were a tourist riding the ""L"" I would have a bad image of Chicago. The CTA really needs to revamp the entire system. But at the end the ""L"" gets me places .... unreliably, making a huge dent in my wallet, and making me want to spray the entire underground system with Lysol and Febreze. Interesting Note - Enjoy the multitalents of the various acts scattered across the different train stations. The Jackson Red line and Blue line stops offers quality entertainment while waiting for the train that never seems to come."
291,5 star rating,"Mar 16, 2012","Visiting Chicago for the first time in June of 2010 I had very high expectation for riding the EL trains in Chicago. After being there a week, I love every single moment I spent riding the EL trains and the buses to get to other parts of the city. Love the passing by the tall skyscrapers in downtown, riding across the river, and checking out my surroundings of the whole city. It was efficient to ride the Blue and red line trains to Lincoln Park and Chinatown at night. Love that it ran under a 24 hour service on weekends. The bus were a adventure and like that it came on time and didn't have to wait too long for one at all. I like the fact that inserting the fare card inside the fare box was very convenient and I just fell in love with riding it everywhere. My favorite part was hearing the announcer telling passenger what was the next stop and told what station to get off to transfer to different parts of the city. I got myself a week pass and it was definitely a bargain rather then driving into the city and dealing with the insane traffic, overpriced parking rates, and running the risk of being bankrupt by the end of my vacation. Keep it up CTA!!"

I am also very fortunate to live within 50 feet of a bus stop and a few blocks from the nearest L station (Addison Brown Line) which came in handy when I recently lost my car to a dead motor and needed to get around.The CTA isn't the greatest, but I'm glad it's here."
296,2 star rating,"Nov 29, 2007","CTA, how I hate you so!You never run on time, your bus drivers are rude and obnoxious. I had one driver on the Pulaski who sat at a stop at Diversey and Pulaski for TEN minutes, I kid you not to wait for the Diversey bus to drop off passengers.  When I informed the driver that I have a Metra train to catch at Fullerton, he told me that I should have left earlier.  I told him to go eff himself. Oh yes, sometimes I think the drivers think it's funny to speed away at the last second when you are running to catch the bus and then you have to wait another 20 minutes for the NEXT one!I hate that you have no bus service on Addison #152 after 10 pm on weeknights and 8:30 on weekends. Kind of defeats the purpose of having mass transit, especially since Addison goes through Wrigleyville where all the bars are and the drunks could use a safe ride home. You must be in cahoots with the cab companies on that one!Your trains are dirty and smelly (yes I'm looking at YOU Red Line, the toilet on wheels!) and are in serious need of repair. They also never run on time and waiting in the stations, especially late at night is always a scary adventure!By the way CTA, how is it that you are always out of money and threatening cuts in service, yet can afford to build a swanky new El station at the Addison Brown Line?You are the reason I thank my lucky stars every day that I own a car!**EDIT**You get one more star because you didn't make me wait 20 minutes out in the cold for the Addison #152 bus when I dropped off my car to be repaired, but no more because you still won't give transfers on cash fares!"

It doesn't come more frequently than any other trains and I've NEVER been on it when it hasn't been delayed or stopped on the tracks for at least 5 minutes.  It's so aggravating to leave on time for work and then be 20-30 minutes late because of the pink line stopping for no reason.  I shouldn't have to allow a half hour for a train ride that is only 3 stops!  And the waiting is just as bad as it was with the blue line because you have to wait for the orange and purple lines to come through first!  And in the winter I would rather wait in the nice, warm underground blue line stop than the freezing platforms of the pink line.  I hope they do away with it soon!"
299,3 star rating,"Sep 27, 2005","Honestly, if I had a car I would NEVER ride the CTA!  Its such a pain in the butt!  Nothing ever comes on time and if it does there's always a delay of some sort, not to mention the enormous amounts of people who ride it, normal and creepy!  The trains are a huge pain if you live out of the loop because about the only place you can change to go from one side of the city to the other is the loop and that adds a good 15-30 minutes to your ride.  The buses are convenient at times if you can find the right one going in the right direction at the right timeHOWEVER, there are a lot of advantages, it is pretty cheap to ride unlimited and I have to say its extremely easy to understand.. plus it saves the hassle of having to designate a driver for a night out and its WAY cheaper than a cab!  Not all the lines run at all times of the night.Check www.transitchicago.com and go to Trip Planner, its an awesome way to know exactly which bus or train to take for your time and destination!"
300,3 star rating,"May 21, 2007","All you people dogging the CTA should really get out more.Our system is actually better than most of the others out there and actually goes to useful places (unlike LA's subway to nowhere).Yes, it's gotten worse in the last few years (worse than it even was when I last lived in Chicago in 1999) but the system still runs and generally gets you to where you are going in a reasonable amount of time.I've never heard of a train flipping over in my 29 years in Chicago - a few have run off the rails or hung suspended in air yes, but that just gives the ride a spirit of adventure. I'll also agree that something has to be done about the Blue - O'Hare line. This review is not about just the Blue line however and as a whole the system operates, even if just barely. At least it's a real system - not like the ""trollies"" out here in San Diego.(PS - How appropriate that the CTA is my 300th review. I couldn't even find something local to review. Oh well, I guess a part of me will always be in Chicago.)"

303,2 star rating,"Jan 6, 2009","Taking the el while living in Chicago was infrequently pleasant.  To start, many of the stations are above ground (giving rise to the nickname, shortened from ""elevated""), which gave you freezing winter winds and summer sweat stains waiting for the train to come.  The timing was unreliable; it always took longer than expected (or quoted on their website).Their ""improvements"" can drive you crazy.  They shut down major stations for weekends or full months at a time - the red line downtown northbound was closed many weekends, which you don't know until you get in the station.  The blue line out to O'Hare has closed two stations during the weekend for the longest time, so with luggage you need to get out, take a shuttle bus for two stops, then get back on (why not just shuttle the whole last four stops?)  I would love to give just one star but you need public transportation.  It's just one of the worst in America.  It's worse than any European system I've been on.  Heck even Delhi has a much better system than Chicago - imagine that!"

Chicago is everything that I love: loud, busy, beautiful, exciting, edgy, crazy, delicious, hot, cold, rainy, humid, dry, and most importantly, walkable and convenient as hell. The CTA, with all of her flaws and faults, is a huge part of what makes this such a great town.Sure, she has her issues. She's late, can't stick to a schedule, crowded and sometimes slow. She raises her rates without improving service, and lord knows her drivers can be surly as hell. She's always there for us, though, no matter what the weather, she's there. El or bus, she never leaves us stranded. Well not always, but you get the point.I missed my Metra train yesterday, and needed to get home quickly so I hopped on the Blue line and transferred to the Purple line, shot home, got back on the Purple line and transferred to the Red line. Maybe the gods were looking out for me, but I didn't have to wait too long and the trains (minus the Red line) really weren't that crowded. Sure, the guy sitting next to me on the Purple line had 13 cloves of raw garlic for lunch, and fell asleep on my shoulder, thus breathing his vampire-repellent breath directly on me, but, isn't that what makes this city beautiful?

311,4 star rating,"Feb 2, 2009","I love the CTA and all public transportation for that matter.  What I don't love though is how most public transportation in the United States pales in comparison to urban areas across the pond.Why can't the CTA add a circle train line?  One that goes from University of Chicago to Western Ave, shoots up Western till the Brown Line and then cuts back to the lake and hits the Red at like Bryn Mawr?  You know how awesome that would be?  Go to Berlin and comapre their U-Bahn and S-Bahn to the antiquated CTA and you will drool with envy.  Imagine being able to leave Rogers Park and be at O'Hare in 30 minutes.  If the Circle Train line existed you could.  It would alleviate the need to ride on one of the East West bus lines during G R I D L O C K rush hour traffic and get you from the Red line to the blue without having to go all the way downtown.Aside from my vexation due to not having a Circle Line I really do heart the CTA.  Based on what it does offer it is way convenient (Why aren't the trains on bus tracker?) , affordable (even with the fare increase it still beats car payments, car insurance, oil changes, parking, gas, and sanity from driving in Chicago), reliable (many 247 buses) and the 'inspiration' for one of the greatest bands of all time (Chicago - originally named Chicago Transit Authority).CTA, I heart you - just add a circle line and I'll give you five stars!"

I have a plan down so that I can get up, get ready and be at the bus stop for no more than three to five minutes in the morning on my way to the gym.  Coming back from the gym is equally predictable.  So is the trip the the Blue Line, for my commute to work.  I have a little more trouble coming home at night, as that's when I tend to veer from the plan.  Last night, I waited from approx. 6:40 PM to 7:35 PM for a bus, when heading east bound on North Avenue.  But, the hour wait is few and far between.It seems to me that during normal conditions (read: regular commutes in acceptable weather) the CTA is great.  When the weather starts to suck or you're going against the grain during a commute, or at an off time, it can be tough.  While not perfect, it still beats the crap out of buying a car, buying insurance and exerting the effort to protect that investment.   On the positive side, it's not illegal to have a couple of brews before getting on the bus.   Pfhew!"

After six months of using CTA's old but reliable system, I was convinced that I didn't need a car in Chicago. CTA saved me enough money to afford moving to the West Coast. There's some irony there, because the transit I deal with now (San Francisco's MUNI) is easily one of the WORST systems in the U.S., and the butt of tourist jokes around the world."

Well, since I do love the CTA I decided just to stick it out and wait for another one...15 minutes later another one shows up, slightly less packed, but still packed.

If you had no money and lived in a shack, would appreciate it if people came to your house and bitched at you because you aren't living in a mansion? Money issues aside minus two stars for bus bunching, mayoral meddling, and the late ""great"" Frank Kruesi, and the suspicion I have that the CTA cares more about tourists and suburbanites than regular folk who need the system (see differing attention given to trains vs buses). But the trains are pretty good, and the system is always there when you need it...well, at least until January."
323,4 star rating,"Sep 23, 2008","This is a very convenient, efficient transportation system. The station agents are nice and helpful, the trains and buses seem relatively clean. The only complaint I have is the lack of maps and schedules. Seriously...is BART the only transportation system that has these available at places other than their website? Their system is a little more complicated than NYC's but it's still faster than the Bay Area's. Hmmm...I'm on the fence on this one but it got me to the places I wanted to go so I really can't complain much."

My only criticism is that there too many morbidly obese people who ride this train.   But that is not the fault of the CTA.    Keep up the good work!"

326,3 star rating,"May 12, 2009","You know, I'm just going to go straight down the middle and say that the CTA is A-OK.  I've traveled to a bunch of cities, both domestically and abroad, and I can tell you that the CTA system (El and buses) are pretty darned good.  Sure, a bunch of times some bus lines suck or the El can't run on time, but also a good number of other times, everything works out just fine.  I think that since we're dealing with a psuedo-government agency and one that is, has been, and will be underfunded, the fact that things run on time and you usually have relatively considerate employees (try having their job and see if YOU can even muster a smile), we have to give the CTA some props for being a decent and massive organization."
327,3 star rating,"Apr 3, 2010","I was ready to write a bad review and rip CTA to shreds, but this time I cannot do so since they redeemed themselves in this particular situation.In hopes of getting more work done at the office, I left my place about half an hour early.  To hasten my arrival downtown, I planned to hop on either of the two bus lines that roll by my corner.  When a bus arrived, I got on and placed my transit card into the machine.  The card popped out through the back and the display indicated it as invalid.  The driver tried the card again with the same result.  He simply told me that my card was not good.  I knew this couldn't be the case since I monitor the expiration dates of my fares and this one was not slated to go bad until 4/18.  (Note: Although the machine prints the expiration date on the back of the card upon activation, this one, as my luck would have it, was printed over the use by date already on the card and made the exp. date almost unreadable.)  He didn't seem willing to let me stay on without paying in an alternative manner and I wasn't about to pull out my wallet (for the record I did have sufficient cash and money loaded on a Chicago card), so I just got off at the stop on the next block.  Needless to say, I was irritated and more than slightly embarrassed as the bus sped onto outer LSD without me.  A few moments later, a bus for my regular line pulled up.  I was so sure that my card would work properly.  Nope.  The card again read as invalid on this bus' reader.  This time the driver nicely allowed me to stay on without paying another way.  I was so thankful for his mercy on me.  While on this bus, I called the 800 number listed on the back of the crappy fare card.  Surprisingly my wait time to speak to a representative was decent.  No elevator music passed through my eardrums.  After hearing my spiel, the rep simply told me to come to CTA headquarters for a replacement.After work, I walked all the way to 567 Lake.  When I got there, I couldn't get over the spanking new and clean appearance of the building.  There's even an artsy, metal bull in the lobby.  This must be where the funds go - not to the trains, buses and miles of train tracks.  Luckily I got there at a good time since there were two people being assisted and one woman ahead of me.  Again, my wait time was not that long.  When I finally got to the window, the line was growing out the door.  Once I got to the front, I only told a brief version of my troubles, turned in my defective pass and filled out a simple form.  Moments later, the clerk gave me a brand new 30 day pass.  I was excited as this was unexpected.  I only had 16 or so days left on my crap one, so I thought they would give me a combo of weekly and day passes to make up for the owed 16 days.  In the end, I really couldn't have faulted the first driver for not allowing me to stay on without paying since he couldn't read the expiration date.  Thanks for making my trek to 567 Lake worth the walk!  Maybe now CTA can do something about the chicken bones under the train seats or people taking leaks (yes I witnessed that tonight) on the El stairs."
328,4 star rating,"Feb 26, 2012","The CTA. It makes living in the city sans a car possible. Well, the PACE bus and Metra trains, and havig two airports help too. They have smartphone apps to help you plan and track your travel and have new train cars in the works that are awesome. Plus, the X-mas Santa train is always refreshing to see during the holidays. If the state would just couch up some more funding to increase the awesomeness of the CTA, that would be awesome."

330,4 star rating,"Nov 30, 2009","Coming from Florida, where efficient public transportation is nonexistent, I have to say some Chicagoans have no idea how good they have it. Yes, I've heard all about the CTA hang ups, and I even experienced some of it for myself while visiting there for a month - but you know what? I'd deal with all of that any day the week as long as it meant not having to rely on my car all the freaking time. In Florida, you drive EVERYWHERE, there is no option. If you have no car you suffer, plain and simple.Part of the reason I'm consider relocating to Chicago, (besides the fact that I love the city), is because I'm tired of having no option. Plus, I love riding trains, taking in the scenery, and people watching.Of course this may turn out to be a different story should I actually live there, but as a visitor, I enjoyed my experience with CTA.P.S. One star off because some of the CTA trains do come off as unkept and smell. I can only imagine the germs lying beneath. *shudders*"

It was quite a savings going public transportation and not dealing with driving and parking....big cities are crazy to drive in.The only negative experience I had was.................only transferring to the Red line going towards 95th which you really need to be careful.  A man was trying to get my attention...asking my how to get to the airport, and probably he was really wanting to rob me.  I'm from the big city, so you learn not to look or talk to people and watch your belongings.The 1 day; 3 day, 7 day passes are a great deal bc you don't need to concern yourself with time limits, or transfers.  it works 24 hours from the time you actually use it and the expiration time and date is on the back of the ticket.Most bus drivers and CTA workers at the stations were all helpful and nice.  There were some bus drivers who seem grumpy, but were willing to assist you.It was great that the CTA public transit system is frequent and covers so many areas.  They can update and modernize their buses, ""L"" trains and stations.  Also, clean up all the debris along the ""L' trains stations"
335,2 star rating,"Aug 13, 2008","Can't say I see evidence of a brain behind this stuff. Trains never follow their schedules, things like the CTA trip planner are always off. And buses are just never on time, ever. The smallest, simplest courtesy they could provide is a tiny little electronic display at L stops and major bus stops that would tell you which stop the thing you're waiting for is at. I just hate the feeling of waiting and waiting (and it's happened before that trains have never came, ie canceled service).The whole bus system is archaic and shitily designed. There should be bus waiting zones, so you pay to enter the waiting zone, then when the bus comes you can just get right on (and we avoid the line of 10 people stopping one after the other to find 2 bucks in their wallet). There should also be about 25% as many stops as there are. Buses stop every block because people are too fuckin fat to walk more than a block (wonder where that cheetos smell comes from?), and yes, this often costs an extra traffic light or two every couple of stops, and probably 20 minutes on an hour-long bus trip.Another backwards thing about the CTA is the complete lack of integration with the Metra. Most other cities have easy and convenient transfer points.The second star was for the fact that there is decent 24 hr coverage and it is cheap (w/ the chicago card)."

I don't appreciate that the last boss, Huberman, ran it further into the ground and got rewarded with a totally undeserved promotion to be the head of CPS.  But still I use it because it means I don't have to drive."

Another train comes in, and it loads and leaves with me still trapped in the first train. Then I get off at Logan to catch the bus, I should have a transfer. My card says insufficient fair so the driver makes me pay the full $2.25 cash - well , unless i want to go back to the station, reload my card, and wait for the next bus (6583)."

341,4 star rating,"Sep 15, 2006","I empathize with those that have posted complaints and/or negative remarks, and yet I agree with those who are complimentary to the CTA. Here's the deal: I've lived in this lovely city for over fifteen years. I moved here straight from Dallas, Tx. In other words, I drove for life. What you cannot argue against (well I guess you could, to the point of infinity) is that the CTA still provides Chicago with one of the best public transportation systems in the US. No, it's not NY's rail system, and it never will be unless a billionaire decides to plunk down hundreds of millions of dollars down to build new lines. But that's not the point. It is a rare case that I cannot figure out a way to get to where I'm going via train or bus. I use either the 7-day pass or the 30-day pass, both of which completely negate the ""but it's [x] amount of dollars to use it!"". Yes, the money could be managed better - but if YOU think you can fix the System that *is* the City of Chicago, good luck. If you haven't been in the political machine here for more than ten years, you're not going to make a dent. Here's what I *don't* pay for by using the CTA:gascar insurancetime spent looking for parkingtickets I will note that I have tried owning/using a car twice, each time for more than a couple months, and saw my costs rise in terms of cash flow (out), time and energy wasted. I've lived on the west side, and now live on the north side. I've had to get to everywhere from Midway to OHare to literally hundreds of places in-between. The CTA, with all its faults, still exists, still functions, and still gets me to where I need to go for an average of $80 or less a month. Without it, I can't get to work, I would have a harder time meeting friends, and I would have seen less of the city. BTW - if you think the system was built as a joke, you really don't f**king know your Chicago history. You also haven't paid attention to what the car companies did in the West and South - they bought up the electric and non-electric rails systems and tore them up in order to sell buses they made to whatever city they wanted to ""compete"" for in the public transportation sector. It's in our history books, its documented in court proceedings and investigations, and it's why we don't have more cities with better public transportation systems. So no, Chicago's system wasn't set up as a joke, but as a means of getting people to where they wanted to be to where they were needed (from home to downtown). Wake up."

In Chicago, we stayed in the Rosemont area and took the train into town.Staring at the ticket machine for a very long time probably doesn't make us look like world travelers but it did attract the attention of the employees there who were incredibly nice & helpful. They took us through the steps to get our ticket, told us about how long it would take to get to downtown and set us on our way. Train ride was very pleasant. Stations were conveniently located near where we wanted to go. People were friendly.Grateful for the kindness of the staff there. Thank you."

To put some perspective on this, I come from a city that has no practical public transit system (Houston, TX).  So, when I travel to other cities with decent public transit options, I simply fall under a powerful spell.  While the spell is potent, it is not complete.  Most of the buses are relatively clean but I'd wash hands at the first chance.  Most of the elevated lines are noisy inside the train, standing outside underneath on the street, or on the platform.  The subway stations are dirty and noisy - I wouldn't eat off the floor and I'd pause before picking up anything that fell on the ground.  ""Do I really need that?"" would be my question.  All of it is pretty old and gritty except for the Brown and Green lines.  Everyone uses the system to get around.But, all a great bargain at $2.25 for a full-priced ride.

Today's episode of ""Raising The Bar of Incompetence/Lowering The Depths Of Helpfulness"" played out as follows:My CTA card was stolen.  I called customer 'service' to find out what to do.  I found out that I should go online and ""replace"" the card and opt to pick a new one up the next day.  *I* should do this.  Fine.  I went online.  Placed a 'replace' order, noted the $5 fee for doing so, scowled & went to bed.  I woke up this morning, got ready for work, caught the bus, paid $2.25, got off the bus, caught a train, paid $2.25, transferred train and entered the gleaming city that is CTA headquarters.  Seriously, it's Ozian in its municipal opulence.  By all the gltiz of the place, I could tell the CTA is hurting for funds.I went up the stairs, waited in line and, finally, approached the window for my new card.  ""Hold.""  Wait.  What?  ""You need to see the customer service gentleman around the corner.  I can't help you.""  Wait.  What?  Disgruntled, but hopeful, I complied and made my way to the reception area.  I told the man behind the desk of my plight.  ""Uhma, I cain't help you.""  Wait.  What? ""You went online and did yo' own card.  I cain't override that.""  Wait.  What?  ""You will get your new card in three or four days.  You shulda never done that.  You shulda came in here and did it for free.  Why didn't you do that?  Now you have to pay your way with cash or get a new cwhard.""  WAIT.  WHAAATTT????!!!!For purposes of any law enforcement reading this, words may or may not have been said.  Threats may or may not have been made.  A phone may or may not have been whupped upside someone's head.  It's all unclear.  And, isn't that all in the past (if something happened, that is)?  Rather than explain to me why following customer service instructions lead me to this dark fate in the first place and it should be someone's job to fix the f up...Rather than rationalize to me why it takes 3 or 4 days for me to pick something up I could have already had in my hands 30 minutes ago and that is processed four blocks from where we stand...Rather than figuring out that giving the customer the ability to place a *hold* on his card in order to freeze the card until the customer can speak to a competent service agent & rectify the situation...Rather than all of this (and more), I was out $30, an hour of my time and a broken nail (from the phone upside the head whuppin').  All I had was a further reason to loathe the CTA.I...I...despise the CTA so...so...much....I have...""Mrs. White"" levels of hate flame on...both..sides of my...my..face.  Everyday is a struggle of late buses, interrupted train service & terrible customer 'service.'  The CTA, from its head management to the legion of rail 'workers' who lounge about 5 at a time ogling women and doing little other than reaping the benefits of collective bargaining, is an exercise in failure.  And we get to pay MORE for it.  More?!  Aaa.  Aaaaa!  AAAAA!!!!!1111!!:(!!!!1  I say thee, nay!  Nay!!"

The Joker.  Johnny T. v. the CTA.  Yes, the CTA is my arch enemy and one day I will destroy it.  In the years I have been riding the CTA, I have come to terms with an 11 minute drive taking 40.  I have found some peace with the fact that running for a bus means the driver WILL pull off that much quicker in an attempt to leave you behind.  I try to remain calm as I walked the #22 route from Andersonville to Lincoln Park and NEVER.SAW.ONE.BUS!  The same thing happened as I walked from Lincoln Park to the Loop.  I almost crapped my pants when I saw two thugs beat up a Chad whose only fault was having a mouthy Trixie as a girlfriend (said gf was the reason Chad got popped).  I felt for the young woman who was pick pocketed IN FRONT OF THE CPD and nothing was done (Roosevelt stop, Red Line).  I channel my inner chi as I stand in sub-zero temperatures, without cover, as 30 mph winds attempt to cut me to my very soul waiting for a bus that is 35 minutes late.  I put a smile in my voice when dealing with CTA customer service reps who would care less about giving you the right information or answering the phone in a timely manner.  I very nearly lose my isht when I see Ron Huberman on the news talking about an organization he is so woefully ill-equipped to run (gotta love Chicago patronage; the dude was a BEAT COP!  He didn't even have so much as a CTA card before King Daley gave him the CTA gig!).  But I stay calm because I look at this as my training.  Just as the Bride suffered under the cruel tutelage of of Pai Mei, so must I suffer and train under the evil of Ron Huberman and the CTA.  Only then will I have the skills necessary to vanquish my enemy.  You see, this is about more than me and the CTA.  Bring on the House of Blue Leaves and the Crazy 88.  No problem.  I'll handle it.  This is an eternal struggle of good v. evil.Ron Huberman - I call you out.  The hanky, it is dropped.  Cage Match.  Winner takes the reins of the the tattooed beast that is the CTA."

355,4 star rating,"Dec 1, 2009","The CTA gets a bad rap, methinks. For those of you weighing the benefits of taking mass transit vs. driving, consider this.   -  You get where you want to go probably a little slower - unless you're on the train when it's snowing. Snow ain't no match for steel on steel. Traffic on the roads = standstill.  -  So you've gotten there 10 minutes later than your driving counterparts, but guess what? You hop off the train or bus and you're there. Hey man, have fun driving around looking for a parking space for your car for 20 minutes before having to pay for parking. I'm already on my second beer and I just gave away your seat.  -  Oh, you can't drink because you've gotta drive home? Ha! Night owl buses and trains rule. And late night, they're hilarious. But sometimes sketchy. Which is sometimes hilarious.   -  Yeah, sometimes the tracks get re-routed and you've gotta re-plan for stuff. Good thing you've got that invincible car that NEVER goes on the blink and needs to be repaired which NEVER costs you hundreds of extra dollars.Look, I've ridden public transit in many American cities, and Chicago has it good. Is it going to be as convenient as the NYC subways? Not quite. But in terms of ease of use and cleanliness, the CTA is pretty darn good. As far as trains (or buses) being dirty, I'm not sure what lines you're riding (I'm a regular on Brown-Red-Orange-Blue, in that order), but they're not bad. Gross things happen. You live in a city. It'll be okay, just watch what you sit in. I'm car-free for the first time in my adult life, and I love it."
356,3 star rating,"Feb 11, 2017","The good: Thanks to the CTA, getting around Chicago without a car is not only possible, it is cheaper than using a car and paying for gas, parking, insurance and repairs. With connecting buses and trains all over the city, planning a trip is simple and quick. Actually taking that trip, however, is another story.The bad: While I have come across many kind, intelligent and helpful CTA drivers, there are also those bad apples who make a civilized person question the collective morality of humanity itself. Sadly, those bad apples are becoming more and more prevalent, while the decent human beings are being shoved out of the way. So that kindly bus driver who took the extra time to check and make sure that the person in the wheelchair was strapped in, comfortable and happy? Sadly, she is becoming a rarity among drivers, while the basic decency that we all should expect becomes such an uncommon thing that we feel the need to applaud such humanity when we come across it.  Just in the last week:A driver passed up  group of people, who then began running after the bus and shouting for him to stop. Not only did he fail to stop, he saw them standing there, saw them waving their arms, heard them shouting (we all did) and he just kept on driving without any expression on his face. Another driver was quite rude to, and short with, an older woman using a walker. He kept huffing and puffing as she tried to get on the bus, and then, in a frustrated and impatient snit, gruffly told her to hurry up. Then, he began driving away even before she was able to sit down, to the point where she began to wobble a bit as if she were going to fall. Luckily she was not injured, but the next time, a disabled person might not be so lucky. The above-mentioned bus driver is the same person who shouted at a man who tried to get off the bus in the back. The man pulled the ""stop request cord"" and the bus did stop - but only to pick up other passengers. The driver never opened the back door. So when he began driving again without letting the man off, the man had to shout to be let out. The driver then became angry and shouted at the man to hurry up, telling him that he should have paid attention, which is ironic, because the man did pay attention; it was the driver who did not. Back door issues seem to be happening more and more as drivers fail to acknowledge the ""stop requested"" notification when someone wants to get off. In another situation, a man pulled the cord to request a stop. The driver stopped, but only to let other people on. He then took off without letting the man off the bus. The man, who was attempting to get out the back door because the front of the bus was crowded with baggage and a wheelchair, shouted for the driver to let him out, which of course did not happen. He ended up having to run to the front of the bus and demand to be let off. The driver finally let him off, after saying nothing, admitting nothing, and staring with an almost puzzled expression at the man, as if the driver could not comprehend what the man was saying, doing or requesting. This lack of comprehension makes me wonder if the CTA hires just anyone who walks through their door, regardless of intelligence or cognitive ability. And then there was yet another situation where the driver failed to let someone out the back door. Again, the front was pretty full so for people sitting in the back, using the back door is the best option. A woman pulled the ""stop request"" cord to be let out at the next stop. The driver slowed down just a bit as if he was going to stop, but he was clearly only doing so to let people on the bus. When he realized they did not want to get on, he just kept going. The woman shouted for him to stop and he did not. So, the woman pulled the cord again for him to stop at the next bus stop. He stopped, let other people on, and did not let her out the back door. He then took off, and the woman shouted even louder at him to STOP. Everyone on the bus looked confused, and other people began questioning what his problem was, that this woman has now tried twice to get off the bus and twice this driver failed to let her off. Finally, because of the commotion, the driver stopped and let the woman off, as well as a few other frustrated passengers. The driver had absolutely no expression on his face for the entire time, though I thought I could make out a smug little grin. Maybe I just imagined it. Also, the change to cloth seats, from the plastic variety, was a pretty bad idea. First of all, it is obvious when plastic is wet, while it isn't always obvious when cloth is wet. I'm sure you get where I'm going with this. Also, plastic is easier to clean, simply wipe it down with some sort of cleaning solution, where as cloth requires an actual shampooing with equipment. The CTA is a necessity for many of us living in the city, and I for one am grateful for it. But improvements are in order."

I was victimized by a man who sat down behind me asked me for the time with his penis in his hand, whacking off! Pig! Not only him but the other riders including a pilot and cta employee were of no help. I yelled out and no one even budged a bit. Shame on the Chicago public! Don't expect strangers to help. By the time the conductor found out the pervert was gone. I reported the assault and cta security never called me back. Apparently that's par for the corse because the train conductor said they never do a thing to help with security. He was apologetic though. Beware this type of pervert doesnt stop at that crime, they are dangerous predators!Don't use the trains unless you have backup!"

Where else can you ride around looking into people living rooms from the tracks.  The El takes you everywhere for $2, including the airport, and most lines run 24 hours.  On top of that you can get a monthly pass and ride the El as much as you want, something BART will never be able to say.....count your blessings Chicago!"
363,3 star rating,"Jun 23, 2009",I'll break it down to you and give it my personal stars for every part of the service. 5 stars because it gets me to where I need to. 5 stars because they now have hybrid buses. That's all the 5 stars they get. everything else about it pretty much sucks. It seems like the drivers make up their own schedules. I use google maps or their bus schedules to show me what time the bus is supposed to leave the bus station or pick me up at a particular stop. I use the Jefferson Park terminal everyday to get home from work.I was testing the google maps transit schedule to see if my 56 Milwaukee bus would leave at like 9:40 pm. Sure enough it was late because the driver came from eating at McDonald's because he had his McDonald bag with him. Also if the driver leaves earlier then the schedule says we all have to suffer on the bus because the drivers will sometimes sit at a bus stop for 5 minutes because they are making up the time. Oh and the 80 Irving Park route sucks too because when they arrive at Irving Park and Central they sometimes have to wait for a new driver to take over the route and one day a few years back we had to wait over a half hour for the new driver. Other buses wouldn't pick us up. Most of the drivers are rude as hell.You can't complain to them because they will yell at you back. They have been working on the EL tracks for years. They said the work would of been all done last winter but it seems like they are starting all over again. i have one more story. I bought a 7 day bus pass and it worked for a couple of days and after a couple of days it wouldn't work. It would say invalid everytime I put it in the slot. All the drivers let me on anyways but there was one driver who wouldn't let me ride. I even showed him that it didn't expire yet but you couldn't tell because the ink that they use to print out the expiration date smeared up. He threatened to call the police on me if I didn't either pay or get off. So that is my review about the CTA.

367,5 star rating,"Jun 22, 2007","I hear people complain about the CTA... it's ridiculous. Y'all don't know how good you have it. Fare is totally reasonable... at home (bay area), you pay by distance on the subway... it's a good four bucks to get from Berkeley to SF. A $2 flat fee is nothing, especially when you consider you can transfer b/t lines for free... get from one side of the city to the other? That's a deal. Plus unlimited monthly passes, good for the El and busses, are very reasonably priced if you take public transportation daily (which most of us without cars who aren't hermits do).I mean, c'mon, most lines run all night. Yeah, it sucks that they run somewhat slower than during the day.You know what sucks more? Bay Area trains stop running at 12:30. Get to the station in SF after a show at 12:35? Gotta fork up cash for a taxi. A lot of busses stop running at 9PM. The rest stop running at 12:30. There're three lines in the entire east bay that run at night, they come every 20-45 minutes. That sucks.Back in the olde country, you practically have to be a semi-retarded amputee carrying a newborn and two bags of groceries for someone to yield their seat. Here, every time I've gotten on a train w/o open seats (except for once during rush hour), some nice young businessman's offered me his. Of course, I'm a sweet young thing in heels, but still.So. Stop complaining, stop trying to be New York (big apple envy is the plague of every other city in America), go anywhere else in America, then whine."
368,1 star rating,"Aug 23, 2007","I'm trying to think what the CTA deserves one star for....ummm, I can't think of anything.  The following are just a few events that took place in the past two weeks. 1) Mon, Aug 13th p.m. rush- #146 bus breaks down between Addison and Irving.  I took this bus only because I wanted a seat and some air conditioning.  Usually I'd take the #147, but they seem to have a worse rate of break-down this summer anyway.    A #151 comes and instead of waiting for another #146, a few of us think, what the hell, it's better than standing here, waiting and waiting.  But oh nooooo...the #151 bus driver has another idea.  She argues with us that when a bus breaks down, you can't get on another bus route because of some stupid-a$$ rule.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but hasn't the CTA already gotten my fare, and in return, failed to take me to my destination?  Shouldn't I be compensated by being allowed on a bus that will get me there...eventually...even if it is on the slower-than-slow route that the #151 is.  Thankfully the #146 bus driver argued our case and we were allowed on, not after making the rest of the #151 riders annoyed for delaying their commute though. 2) Wed, Aug 15th a.m. rush- Get on an empty #144 bus at Sheridan and Berwyn.  The bus turns the corner onto Foster, collects about 10 more people and then after watching the bus driver and the supervisor talk and point at the back of the bus for about 10 minutes, the driver tells us to get off where we find the back of the bus leaking like the proverbially ""cow on a flat rock"".  Now tell me...HOW did this bus even get out of the bus yard in the first place?  It was clear that when the bus driver picked me up, that it was his first stop for the day.  The bus route number had to be set, buttons pushed, etc. So how, after turning the corner did he all of a sudden realize there was fluid leaking out of the back? ANd if he didn't realize...shouldn't he have, instead of getting us on the bus and then tossing us off to catch another one.  Because that's all we have to do in the morning is get on and off buses in an attempt to get to work. 3) Thurs Aug 16th p.m. rush- Chicago Card Plus fare card stops working out of the clear blue.  No cracks, no scratches, no reason.  I didn't tap dance on it, use it to scrape ice off a windshield, or try to put it in an ATM machine.  But it was safely tucked away in a little bus card holder, in a pocket of my tote bag... THAT must be it!!!  OR, maybe it's that pesky polar magnetic field reversal thingy going on?  That's it though, the card is kaput and I have to order a new one. I'll use my husband's for the time being....stay tuned for more on the fare card. 4) Sat - Aug 18th - Air & Water Show weekend - So I realize buses will be more crowded this weekend and a commute could take longer. I leave Foster & Sheridan at 10:00 a.m. with the hopes of arriving at DIversey and Clark at 11:30.  I wait for about 15 mins for the Foster bus, then decide to walk to Clark.  At Clark, the bus stop is crowded, not a good sign. I walk down a block and then another and after waiting at least a half an hour for the the bus, one comes that is so crammed packed you couldn't squeeze a piece of paper onto it. It's 11:15 at this point, so I give up and take a cab.  The point is, with a major function going on in the city and huge crowds anticipated making the trek toward the air & water show, shouldn't the service be amped up??  I mean after all, all the media keeps saying ""take public transportation, it's the best bet to get there?  Yeah, right!  Maybe the CTA didn't know there was an event going on.  4) MondAug 20th p.m. rush - #147 bus breaks down on Michigan avenue in front of the Hancock.  Yippee, we all had to pack onto an already crowded #147 5) WedAug 22 p.m. rush - I got on a #144 that not only didn't have any air conditioning, but most of the windows were screwed shut, presumably because they don't stay shut when you want them to.  Not like buses leak or anything in the rain...ahem...that's another story altogether.  Ever sit on a completely wet fabric seat first thing in the morning.  One can only hope that it WAS indeed from rain.  Anyway, the no air bus was on a 90+ degree, 100% humidity day.  Thought I was going to pass out. 6) Thurs Aug 23rd a.m. rush - Husband's Chicago Card Plus craps out, so now I have to pay with cash.  And the money on his card, even though it's under my account, can't be transferred to my card.  Of course the card was just topped up yesterday, so unless I want to lose that money, I've got to order ANOTHER card, because these cards never crap out when you have only a couple of dollars on them.  hmmmmm.  Oh, and don't forget the $5 fee to replace the card....so that's $10 in one week, for two cards that have to be replaced. I just get more and more irritated with the CTA, especially in the face of the proposed fare increases and route eliminations."

After reviewing my morning it was pretty clear that I had left it on the bus and was more sure that it was gone forever.  My ID, that was pain (think getting around Chi town during NATO), the credit cards a real pain and the wad of cash, more than $200... what can you say?  I knew they were gone but as a last effort called CTA.   AND THEY HAD IT!!!!  I had to go out to Kedzie to , along way for a guy who lives downtown.  Everyone that I spoke to there was so nice, the security guy walked me to the office, while I waited 3 people POLITELY asked if I had been helped.  I have so much new respect to the employees of CTA.   I walked away from what could have been a miserable experience so so happy and so pleasantly surprised,  Thank you."
370,5 star rating,"Sep 25, 2010","Everyone has an opinion, and I respect that. Seems like quite a few people here don't like the CTA. I love it. As you can see, I come from Las Vegas. A public transit user's nightmare.Miss the bus in Chicago? A lot of the time your wait for the next one won't be any longer than 15 minutes. Miss the bus in Vegas? You're screwed. There's only about 8-12 bus lines which take less than 30 minutes between their runs (one of those is The Strip. 2 or 3 of them mostly serve the ghetto. Wow). The rest of them take at least 30 minutes (Some of them take 45 minutes or even a whole entire hour). I would go into other examples, but I don't want to bore anyone in the audience or get so pissed off thinking about my frustrations with the RTC that I throw my laptop into the wall as hard as I possibly can. The CTA is awesome in my opinion. The majority of buses run very frequently and none of the stops are too far away from each other or have useless locations. The eL is amazing, perfect way to explore the city since it's above ground and much easier than having to ride several different buses if you want to go somewhere on a different side of the city.The day passes may seem at little steep with no other basis but are totally worth it once you realize how good the service is. I regularly pay $5.00 for a day pass in Las Vegas (75 cents less than Chicago) and I honestly think that's the biggest rip off in the world with how infrequent, unreliable and generally bad it is. Not only that but they have several express buses which stop at various city landmarks, perfect for tourism. I definitely am biased seeing that I just compare everything to the godawful public transit they have where I live but I really cannot shower the CTA with enough praise. In the city of Chicago I imagine this would be even better than driving."

Chicago card plus is awesome - love getting credit card points for my transit. El isn't fast compared with other cities but it is reliable and they rarely have major service outages (see NYC). Express trains to ORD and MDW will be great. The bus system borders on unacceptable. Waiting 30 mins for busses that are supposed to be 12 minutes apart, only to have 3 come back-to-back-to-back with one nearly empty ... well, there has to be a solution. Someone figure it out."
375,1 star rating,"Feb 8, 2013","I called CTA customer service on 1/22 because their lovely system charged me 'per ride' when I had designated it as '30 day pass' . I had switched it a few times before taking my first ride.  I changed it to '30 day pass' on the morning of 1/13/2013 because that was the last day to buy the pass at $86.00.  After a few days, I checked and they were charging me per ride. I called and spoke to a rep and she said, 'You tricked the system'  But my account said '30 day pass' at 9:52am on 1/13 and I didn't take a ride till 10:27am that day.  Sounds like a dullard of a system if it can be tricked that easily!!  She did a case for me and said it would take them a week to get to it due to how busy they were. It is 2/8 and I haven't heard a thing.  Terrible customer service.I doubt I will ever get the refund I'm entitled to.  I have followed-up twice through the Chicago Card Plus website and have referenced my case number each time. CTA, without doubt,  is an unmitigated mess. Also, in case you don't know. CTA raised the price of the monthly pass from $86.00 to $100.00 based on data that their computer system retrieved showing that the majority of the monthly pass users lived on the North Side along the Lake.  They determined that 'these people' had enough disposable income to afford the increase. I guess their computer system is good for something:   Taking advantage of their customers!!"

For instance, this morning I was to go to the Fairmont on Columbus Ave. I live in the northwest part of the city. According to transitchicago.org the shortest commute was one hour! Yes, one hour to travel 11 miles. Of course, the car is not an option because traffic is horrendous in this city. Gas prices are highest in the country and the parking situation in Chgo is highway robbery. To those that counter with try public transportation in other cities. Well yes I have! Atlanta's Marta is clean and efficient. SF is easy because the city is small. Same with Seattle. Denver's is good also. I have also driven in LA and would rather deal with that traffic than Chicago's CTA. Believe me you get further faster driving in LA!"
377,2 star rating,"Oct 20, 2005","The universal truth about Chicago's public transit system is - when it's running well, we love it, but when it's messed up - and it seems to be messed up WAYYY too often, we despise it. Anyone who has travelled exensively to other big cities around the nation/world quickly realizes that our transit system is pretty sad - with some exceptions on the newer lines, much of our city rail system is operating on an infrastructure that was designed over 100 years ago and hasn't changed a whole lot since then. Even more ""modern"" components such as fare card machines break down with frustrating regularity. Folks in the downtown & lakeshore areas are most fortunate, as they have many rail/bus options and more frequent service, but as you move farther from the lake & away from the major train lines, you are almost always better off driving, cycling, or just walking."

381,3 star rating,"Feb 20, 2017","Chicago Transit AuthorityI've been riding the CTA since I could remember. My grandmother can't drive. For years during every weekend when I would stay with her and we would ride the bus and go on an adventure. As a child, riding the bus was fun and adventurous. But as I got older and began to ride the bus it became a reality. It's just a public transportation system. It's not perfect and it's not horrible.  Maybe my judgement was clouded from my childlike mind and the buses have always been the same. But today much of the CTA climate has changed for better and for worse. In order to be an effecient and avid rider of the CTA riders should be able to acclimate to tight spaces, close proximity to others, slow routes. Many of the more popular lines going downtown are crowded especially the trains. The CTA buses are much better than they used to be although some of the newer design choices are questionable. Many old buses with the ""too small seats"" and cramped aisle are still in use today. But most of the buses going around are modern with the automatic doors, proper heating and cooling, wide and comfortable seats, and equipped with a better Ventra card reader. These more modern buses are very comfortable and pleasant to ride on. So after a long day it would be relatively comfortable to ride on the train or bus going home. However, there is one very new model of the CTA buses where the seats are made out of a plastic like material without padding, compared to the older seats these are worst. I've gotten on the bus during a rainy and snow day and you'll find passengers sliding out of the seat struggling to just sit up. These seats are impossible for little children to sit in without getting injured. CTA buses and trains use a new modern card system called Ventra. You can automatically load your Ventra card with the app on your phone and it's very easy and modern compared to most public buses in other cities.  To use the card on the buses and trains you just tap it and go. The downside is the card can be faulty so CTA riders should have backup dollars because no one will have change. I've seen passengers get kicked off the bus in terrible weather because of there card being faulty on Ventra's part.  Overall the CTA is a great means of public transportation around Chicago. It is relatively efficient and saves a lot of money from driving and car services like Uber, especially when going to places like Downtown Chicago everyday."

In an era of rising gas prices, the CTA provides relatively quick, clean, and safe transportation from anywhere in the city to just about anywhere else. I was able to get from my apartment in Lakeview to my job in Hoffman Estates exclusively using public transit. It's something I'm proud of, and something I think locals forget. The CTA isn't perfect, but it's so much better than the alternative, it's not even funny."

For the life of me I cannot figure out why CTA can't have some more or longer trains running during the 5 to 7 o'clock pm hours. The Blue Line is SO crowded. I don't get it and for that reason I gave the CTA 2 effing stars. And on the same point - why must ppl squeeze there large arses into cars that clearly cannot hold another person? It is OKAY to wait for another train - oh you are right I forgot - that one will be packed too. I hate you CTA."

Well, they're getting better since management changed, but the CTA has yet to find that happy balance between early and late, as the media is always quick to report.Clean. If you consider ""smelling of bizarre industrial cleanser"" clean. Now if they could get rid of the disgusting felt seats, we'd be in business.Safe. Not so much. Anyone who has ever been subjected to a ""why my life sucks and you should give me money"" speech from someone who has the distinct rattle of pills about them will likely agree.Friendly. I've had a handful of friendly bus drivers, and I'm sure working for the CTA means oodles of stupid questions from directionally and life-challenged individuals. Most employees I've seen have a distinct  ""please let the torture end soon"" look about them. Probably because they've got passengers who attempt to exit a rapidly moving vehicle on a frighteningly regular basis.We must all pause to remember that not everyone has a transit system like we do in Chicago, and management seems to be legitimately trying to make it better. But if you've ever wanted to be excruciatingly close to your fellow man, take an express bus downtown at 7:30AM."

CTA really needs to step up  on picking up passengers on time at the bus and train stations.  Those that are sleeping on the job should be given verbal  and then final written warnings when sleeping on the job in carts. I have eyes. And you guys should do something about the bums that smell up the train.  Not only that, they harass people."

The bus stop used to be exactly where the man was but now it is moved across the street so busses do not block and create traffic when buss would pull over.

391,1 star rating,"Nov 5, 2012","Today I watched with horror as my Chicago Card slid from my hands on the Francisco platform and onto the tracks. Seeing as it is a ground level station I figured I could, at the very least, make the station attendant aware of the situation and possibly retrieve my card at a later time. Instead, what I got was a lengthy lecture on how this happens all the time, how this employee is old and can't just jump down onto the tracks anymore, how I needed to swipe my card, place it into my wallet and then proceed through the turnstile and so on... basically I was berated and treated like an annoyance. As we walked to the opposite end of the platform (Francisco has a North and South entrance) I was lectured non-stop. When I showed the employee where the card was - a mere 5 feet inside the crossing entrance - I offered to stand on the platform at it's location as a visual queue to the employee. Instead I was yelled at and told to stand at the gate so I could let them back in. Guess what, the employee walked 15 feet past the card and loudly complained that he couldn't find the card. So much for trying to be proactive and helpful, right?Great customer service CTA. I work with client's all day and I don't lecture them about my personal likes and dislikes, nor do I give them a piece of my mind because, god forbid, I have to get out of my seat at my desk to assist them. It's part of my job! And, guess what CTA, your customers are individuals and don't appreciate being clumped together into a group set aside for general spite and malicious commentary. You work in an industry that sees hundreds of thousands of people a day, so things are going to happen and they're going to often times be similar in nature. But that doesn't give you the right to berate your customers.If the CTA had a policy in place where they don't retrieve cards from the tracks, but instead give the customer instructions on how to deactivate the card and request a new one - then I would have understood and followed suite. What I don't need is belittlement and hand slapping at the hands of your employees for an honest error."

I have stuck by your side thru thick and thin.  I have spent untold thousands on you. I have taken my friends, my 72 year old mother - I even make my friends take the el to my home from O'Hare, picking them up at the Irving Park stop.I have watched people puke and sleep and eat and beg for money and LIVE on the el. But my patience is wearing thin.  1.  Does it really have to take me 45-60 min to go 9 miles from the Brown Line Francisco stop to the loop?  Really?  Seriously?2.  I have a Chicago Plus Card. I supported you on this venture. But my company hands out CTA checks to supplement our transit costs.  The ONLY place in the city to my knowledge where we can go to put the check on our Plus Card is at your Lake Street office.  Honest to god? Not even Jewel or Dom's can be set up to accommodate this? We have to march our ass to Lake and Jefferson?  3.  Again - the Chgo Plus Card.  I can't check my balance at the kiosks in the stations? I have to do it online?4.  The personnel at the Lake St office have about as much personality as a Qtip. They are often rude, condescending and surly. I have noticed - this KILLS me - that for the last year they have now posted signs at each window ""Please wait to be called to the window."" Why? So they can continue talking on the phone and filing their nails? And WHY are there always closed windows when there are people in line - especially at lunch time?I have saved my most recent bitch for last - your new idea to remove seats from the Brown Line cars so as to accommodate more riders.  What is this - Japan? Are you soon going to have workers whose job it is to stand at each station and push everyone onto the train? Go to Youtube to see this high tech approach.  Or, wait - maybe you already did.Tonight was my first experience with this new endeavor.  I got on the Brown Line at Madison and Wabash at 5:20 pm and I had to stand for the next 50 minutes until I got to Francisco - 2 stops from the end of the line. Unless every Chicagoan loses 65 lbs, I do not believe that making most of us stand will help more people fit on the car. I looked around me - and most everyone looked tired and pissed as hell. I hope this latest idea of yours fails and fails miserably.Recently I attended a lecture by an architecture professor who said that the mass transit system in Chicago is like something you would find in a Third World country. I am starting to think I agree with him."

I want to get in...buy my tourist pass...and ""be out""!I would use the regular machine, but I don't want to buy a ""buy the ride"" card as the tourist card is more economical.Over the trip on the Orange line from Downtown to the loop, is easy, quick, economical and pretty much uneventful.  It's certainly better than renting a car and trying to find parking or using a parking garage especially if the majority of the things you plan to do are withing a few miles radius of the loop.  Transit and walking a definitely your best bet.If you're going to buy a transit card at Midway, please be advised you might have to wait in line to purchase.  There are ""regular"" machine, and machines that dispense, ""visitor"" passes.  Most machines take credit cards.

394,2 star rating,"Nov 1, 2010","I have such mixed feelings about the CTA. I take the 156 daily to and from work, and other buses as needed. I take the train less often, but I've commuted on it in the past, and still use it occasionally.Even though the prices keep going up, it's still less than a cab or parking, so I won't complain about that. Sometimes the buses or trains break down and make me late for work, but that's just life, so I won't complain about that. In the snow sometimes there are great delays and you're waiting in the freezing cold for a long time, but that's Chicago weather, so I won't complain about that. There are a few things that I will complain about, though as a general rule I hate complainers. There is just no consistency to the ""bus driver rules"". I've been on buses that are so packed people are literally stuffed up against the front door and have to move at stops to allow the door to open. Once the driver apologized and said she was required to stop at every stop no matter what, and it was up to the rider if they wanted to/could squeeze onto the bus. I've also been on buses where the driver adamantly obeys the ""behind the yellow line rule"" and says if the bus is full with everyone at the line, they don't stop at new stops unless someone wants to get off. Both sound plausible to me, but they are polar opposites, who is lying to me? I've had numerous instances where I pull the stop cord, hear the ding, and see ""Stop Requested"" flash on the screen by the driver, and they still don't stop at my stop. I've often been standing at a stop (I take the 156) when the 151 is picking up passengers. Then the 156 drives by and sees the bus there and passes it, quickly en route to the next stop, not caring about those of us waiting at THIS stop, like if the 151 isn't good enough for us, we're out of luck. This doesn't always happen, but often enough. I've also been standing at a bus stop more than once with no other bus around, and had the bus driver just cruise right by me. Sometimes they see me and stop up ahead, letting me run through traffic in the busy street to climb on. Sometimes they are so oblivious they just keep cruising. Am I crazy, or is noticing riders waiting at stops a big park of bus driving? I've been on a bus as it pulls away from a stop, and someone comes running up banging on the door. The bus is now 3 feet from the stop where the person stands, looking forlorn and late, and the drivers don't stop. I tried to find online if there is some bill of rights for CTA passengers like when you're in a cab, and it turns out we have no rights. And I find no information about the so-called rules that various drivers have told me about, all being different. I'll continue to take the bus...because I have no other options. But it's a shame some drivers seem to get great thrills from their power over us. Ruling this commuting world. Truly, what could we do that would affect them? Writing a review seems to be my only option. I have emailed the CTA before (a few times) and I've never heard back. I know I've said this in like...a million other reviews (or at least one), with unemployment so high, find people who will do the job AND be friendly. Or warn drivers they also need to be pleasant or their jobs are at risk. One tip: if you smile sweetly and greet your driver with a good morning, good afternoon, or good evening; it does seem to make their day. I bet half their grump is from a complete lack of appreciation."

I'm sure if I lived in Chicago I would have a love for the El much like I have a love for the T even though its similar to the El in a lot of ways.    You definitely get a nice old city feel as you walk around the loop and see and walk under the old raised tracks.  As we headed out and back to Ohare we had to wait a bit longer than I'd like for a blue line heading in that direction, but I guess you can't ask for much on a Sunday morning.

I use the Blue Line regularly, and admittedly do need to get a Chicago Card, but the more elegant system that New York's MTA and San Francisco's MUNI for example have worked out is to allow fare purchase by credit.  This city is vying for an olympic bid, but they can't even make their public transportation convenient for the casual rider?  I've also been long disappointed by their spotty service record, having waited up to 45 minutes for a bus before I ended up calling a taxi.  They just rolled out some new system where you can track how far off the next bus is to you, but not all lines are added, and I've yet to see it in use.  I applaud their effort to keep up with technology, but in this instance it is only because they are implementing a system where newer buses outfitted with flat-panel TVs will be able to target  advertisements to specific neighborhoods based on their GPS location.  All this while I can't even buy my fare at the time of commute electronically."

It cost too much money to ride filthy CTA buses or subway ($10 for a day pass or $2.25 for one ride with no transfer) First of all, I advise any visitor in Chicago to NOT take public transportation anywhere....but if you must ride CTA avoid any economically depressed area. Chicago is extremely dangerous and corrupt. The city is going bankrupt it recently closed 55 schools in the intercity. The undereducated Chicagoans gang mentality is displayed in the behavior and attitude of CTA employees that I encountered. If you are taking subway going from Midway airport or O'Hare airport to downtown or Northside..you ""MAY""be safe. Anything else you are putting your reputation and life in danger.

Further out, the distance is a bit greater, but the system seemed to work well for us during our 48 hour visit.  Getting to and from the airport was a breeze, which made a great impression on this tourist.  Big plus allowing food/drink on the train.  I was pleased to be able to keep my morning coffee with me as I went through the turnstile.  Word of advice to other tourists.  Express machines will only add a minimum of $5 to your fare card.  Regular machines will let you add less than that if you just need fare back to Midway or O'Hare."

Any problems or confusion I've had taking public transportation were a result of myself simply not really knowing where I was going--but a simple consultation of the CTA route map before setting out to somewhere new usually guarantees a smooth trip.

413,4 star rating,"Apr 23, 2010","I'm sure if I lived here and had to deal with CTA everyday I'd have a different opinion entirely, but as a visitor to the city all I can say is you are very fortunate to have such a well-run, efficient system with such a friendly staff.  I live in a city with old, broken down buses and I was envious every time I saw one of your beautiful, large buses sail by, stopping at well-labeled, capacioius shelters.I took the Blue line out to the airport.  Fast & efficient!  The guys at the ticket area thoughtfully helped me figure everything out, with that typical Chicago friendliness. It must be a terrific place to live--everyone seems so nice! (except the attitudinous ticket sellers at the Art Institute!)"

Our hotel was right next to the ""L"".    $10 for unlimited use in a 24 hour period.   We thought that was a pretty good deal!     There are vending type machines at each 'station', easy to get...we just used exact cash.     We just looked up most of the places we wanted to go on YELP and most of the time there was an option for directions by ""Transit"" and it gave us the station we should get off at.   We grabbed a map at one of the stations and used that a few times too.      The few employees we did talk with did help us...   I think it was fairly clean for a subway system.    We thought Chicago was fairly easy to navigate compared to other areas we've been to.We ended up purchasing a 2nd day and used it to go back to the airport (Midway)...it was easy and you can't beat the price."

418,3 star rating,"Dec 27, 2006","Yes the Pink Line is completely stupid.  However, I feel the need to give it 2.5-3 stars (depending on the day) because I can use it to get to and from work without having to ride the far inferior #21 Cermak bus.  I also don't have to transfer and I get more exercise."
419,1 star rating,"Dec 3, 2009","For the life of me, I cannot figure why Chicago residents put up with this archaic, slow system that routinely makes people late. Perhaps it is better than LA, but is light years behind the subway in NYC and the Metra in D.C. Chicago sucks anyway, but this horrible system makes things so much worse."
420,1 star rating,"Oct 6, 2008","Anyone who thinks the CTA is even remotely adequate has never lived in or even briefly visited a city with a proper public transportation system. You can wax poetic about the clackety-clack of the dear ol' El, but the truth is this is exactly what you get when a complex public transport system is turned over to toadies whose only qualification (literally!) is that they have proven themselves to be utterly devoted to King Richard and ready to serve His Will no matter what. In theory, if they could somehow figure out how to surf the Net without removing their noses from the King's puckered aperture, they might be able to learn at least as much about how to run a major city transport system as Wikipedia has to offer, but there is no evidence that this has happened, not with Kruesi and not with Kruesi #2. To put it simply: the CTA is an utter and unmitigated disgrace. Huberman has taken to threatening blackmail on local citizens if they refuse to enable his plans to loot TIF funds and such - he actually told the crowd in Rogers Park that if they didn't fork it over, he'd walk away and leave the Howard Station renovation half-finished and derelict. (Well, in this case the whole project is so ill-conceived that even finished it will still be derelict. But at least it won't cost $50 million to abort the whole thing, like a certain half-baked mega-station downtown....)If the IOC doesn't run away screaming from this stinking pile of corruption of a town, well... the fix is in.They say you get the government you deserve. We Chicagoans must be really, really bad people to deserve this."

427,5 star rating,"Apr 2, 2011","When I'm in one of my home cities, I LOVE riding the Chicago Transit Authority ""L"" Trains.  Used to ride the Blue Line from Forest Park to O'Hare International Airport every weekend and spend a full day connecting to other lines and branches.  I have to say, these people know what customer service is all about.  Their staff and management are so kind and provide a ton of valuable information on the city and suburbs to visitors and locals.  It doesn't matter if your White, Black, Purple, Blue, Red, etc. these people treat everyone with the utmost respect.  Their trains are also among the cleanest I have ever seen for a wide County train net work.  Not even the Metro in Washington DC can compete with the CTA's Customer service.  I give them 5/5 stars for Customer service and public relations.  Awesome work and keep it up.  Wish you the rider a truly awesome experience."
428,1 star rating,"Aug 16, 2010","Dear CTA,We have to talk. This just isn't working out between you and me. The $80 dollar monthly passes, the half hour waits for a bus during the day, and the excess of crazies on the train. It just isn't working out.I've cheated on you a few times with taxis, but that's because you're not that dependable to get me where I need to go in rush. And everytime I walk somewhere at night after getting tired of waiting for you, you finally come one bus stop away from my destination. You're ignorant, twice this month you passed me by at the Irving park bus stop while I wailed my arms at you. And while I see you waste a green light to wait for a guy in a wheel chair a two blocks aways, you almost never do the same for me. My bike on the otherhand, it's dependable. It always takes the same amount of time to get from one place to another. And it never pukes on me, asks me for money or makes me wait.So it was a good run I guess. But it had to end. But don't worry, we'll see each other soon, like trips down town or blizzardy days when I'm desparate.  But I know there's someone out there for you. Like maybe 3.5 millions someones out there. And their sleeping right now. But I'll be darn if they don't ride you hard tommorrow. I bet you won't even miss me.Best,Sarah"
429,4 star rating,"Nov 7, 2005","Having ridden public transit in many cities, I can say this: the CTA isn't perfect, but it's closer than we in Chicago give it credit for. Yes, the busses are sometimes late, but they always show up. The El takes us to and from all corners of the city-all for $75 a month. I haven't owned a car since 2000, and barely miss it at all. Those who hate on the CTA must want chauffeur driven limos, not subways and busses."

431,1 star rating,"May 20, 2015","I believe that whoever is charge of the CTA should take a long look at revamping the fare system.  First of all if you want to attract new passengers you must give them an incentive to ride.  One incentive is to carry over transfers & eliminate the 2 hour expiration.  Many times I only need to take one bus & trip, yet waste money on transfers I don't need.    $2.25 is pretty steep for people who are out of jobs & it quickly depletes their cash.  Perhaps CTA could make a provision for individuals who need transportation for job interviews.  Right now the IDES has this requirement that job seekers attend school.  School is not going to put cash in their pocket so their focus should really be on getting to & from their interview places that are outside of Chicago.Yes Governor Rauner you can have a hand at this too & stop the reductions & cuts you love to implement.  You want a taste of what it is like, join us on the street & everywhere else so you can learn how the other half lives."
432,3 star rating,"Dec 9, 2007","I used to bemoan Chicago's public transit (when compared to Taipei's much more modern and cleaner system) but then I moved out to Silicon Valley. Public transit there sucks @$$ and makes me long for the El. Sure it can be a little sketchy and I wouldn't recommend riding alone at night but the El gets you to where you need to go. And it's cheaper than trying to drive and park (especially in the Loop and the near North Side). The Chicago Card is a nice upgrade to the fare system, like Taipei's EasyCard. Plus, it's a Chicago icon."

BOO! and BOO! - I would have only given you one BOO!, to match my stars, but I am trying to make my point here.I've lived in Chicago since Sept. of 2001, and have never owned a car - which has left me to travel on foot & by bike, and in inclement weather I have to depend on the CTA, unfortunately (most of the time).Overall, I find it rather disgraceful - has anyone who's in charge of the CTA ever been abroad? How is it that countries and continents ages older than this one (SO progressive & new) offer far better public transportation?Years of practice I suppose.I've spent years trying to be forgiving of the trains that never come, the nearly empty buses that blow by as if all the people lined up on the rainy/snowy/windy/stormy/freezing cold street are invisible, the continually unexplained fare hikes, the less than informed drivers, and the out of order card machines. BOO! CTA - shame on you, Chicago for not figuring it out - get it together already - I mean, after all do you want to be responsible for the potential gold medal winning Olympians arriving LATE to their event?!Oh, and I love this one:"" We heard you, Chicago....'CTA (Blue Line), putting the Rapid back in transit"".Hilarious.BOO!"

441,1 star rating,"Oct 12, 2009","Dear CTA,Wow, I'm really looking forward to paying even more for your totally subpar service! I'm so glad that increasing my train fare by $.50 wasn't enough for one twelve-month period. I'm thrilled that an even larger portion of my paycheck can go toward supporting freeloading senior citizens and retired CTA employees with bloated pensions. Best of all, thanks to the $6 I'll have to pay for a round-trip on the El, you'll be able to continue overpaying the 9,000 remaining union employees, even though most of them are outrageously bad at their jobs. And to top it all off, I'll get to stand out in the cold for even longer while I wait for buses and trains that will run even less frequently.That's awesome, CTA. It really is. I can't thank you enough for providing a service that is both more expensive and and crappier than transit in Boston, New York, Washington, San Francisco...where IS our money going?"
442,2 star rating,"Feb 23, 2010","Hate riding public transport, smelly, and is just me or do the trains stop for just a quick high and bye, how about actually stopping. I also think they need to train the riders, let people off then get on, easy enough people. Then there are the buses, really there has to be a bus stop at every intersection? I also like how they pull out into traffic as if they are the only vehicles on the street. Overall the CTA does what is supposed to do, I guess my gripe is with the soo courteous fellow riders. Enjoy the view out the window, you could be back in Iowa."

On the downside, I HATE when the El and bus are late, it messes me up bad. I also think the 35th st. Sox station needs a bathroom facility badly, there's nowhere to go when you gotta go. Finally, overall I think the CTA system is the lifeblood of the city, just needs to be cheaper I think so more people can take advantage of it."
444,3 star rating,"Dec 14, 2007","Four stars because I don't own a car and don't need one.  I live in Andersonville and take the red line in - living so far north, I almost always have a seat.  (Ha ha, Lincoln Park snobs.)  I rarely have to wait more than five or ten minutes for a train, and honestly, there are days when my forty-minute commute is the most peace I've had all day.  I pull out the knititng (yes, I'm one of those people), pop in the earbuds, and it's happy relaxing time.But there's a star deduction because omg the buses.  First, why can't the #22 have decent buses?  It runs from Polk to Howard, a HUGE run, yet we've got some of the oldest, crappiest buses out there.  Maybe they can give us some of those nice tourist buses, those express ones that are being cancelled.  While most of my bus drivers have been pleasant, I'd love for certain ones to get a refresher course in how not to give your passengers motion sickness by slamming the brake every   half-block.  Also, whoever said to cut out bus stops is totally right.  Why do we have stops at almost every street in River North/Lincoln Park/etc.?  It's ridiculous.  I'd love to see CTA staff walking the trains at night, too, but that will never happen."

449,3 star rating,"Jan 6, 2009","As far as mass transit goes, the CTA is really not THAT bad. Especially the train. The bus is an entirely different matter.Went to NYC for the first time and used the subway... Incredibly confusing and it made me thankful for the L.My biggest complaints though are:A. The Bus - Always, always, always late. Bus drivers will drive right by you, lie to you about what stops they're making, and some of them are downright racist. Which I hate to say, but it's definitely true.B. The Train - The delays are ridiculous and I get tired of trying to figure out which stops aren't going NB for a day, etc. My worst train experience came from being stalked by a homeless man to 2 train cars, and no one helped me. I got off at the Belmont stop (red line) and walked past 2 different CTA employees. This homeless man was quite OBVIOUSLY following me (hiding behind things and staring at me, following me when I moved). I even went downstairs and stood by the guards near the gate, again they did nothing. I was really scared and the fact no one helped me (at 10am on a weekday) worries me."
450,4 star rating,"Jan 11, 2011",The CTA has greatly improved. It now has the new 5000 car series for the trains and i can't wait until they put the cars on every line. The buses are inconvenient at times. If you combine the bus with train sometimes your train will show up at your stop and then the bus you are waiting for leaves and your stuck for about 20 minutes. All together though the CTA  is very good :)

Some bus drivers are so ignorant and need to either like their job or fake that they do cause there's not to many jobs open. The winter waits are a bitch so cold in the morning.

I partially blame myself on this one, but seriously CTA gift store, get your act together. I placed an order for a poster that was listed as in stock on 12/11/12. Plenty of time for the USPS to deliver it to me in the standard first class mail shipping time. Today, as I'm just beginning to wonder where my package is, and why it's still listed as ""in process"" in my account, I get an email saying:""I am writing with an update on your order as the print is not in stock at the moment in our warehouse and would not arrive until after Christmas. I wanted to give you the option to change to one of our Quick Ship items which would arrive before Christmas of to check if we were ok with post holiday delivery.""Typos aside, this email is still appalling. Because it came to me a full 8 days after I placed the order. I understand that things can go out of stock, but normally don't you figure that out a day or maybe even two after the order was placed?? I now have to scramble to find something else, and those quick ship gifts did not compare to the poster I originally selected. Again, I should have known better, but CTA, you should be embarrassed. While I appreciate do the offer of allowing me to switch my item, which probably shows you realize you screwed me over, I'm waiting on a response about how I can cancel the order. And yes, this review can get worse based on that response.Moral of the story, don't buy things in the CTA store. Pay a little extra and get the posters and items on other websites or in a store downtown."

462,4 star rating,"Apr 2, 2015",We would encourage anyone visiting Chicago to purchase the CTA Ventra card. This card can be used on the buses and subways as well. We used both daily and we purchased our cards at a local Walgreens. Such a great deal and incredibly convenient!! We had so many kind bus drivers assist us in finding our way to several destinations. Many of whom remembered where we had asked to go and cued us prior to arriving at the scheduled stop. This was especially helpful as we traveled with two teens one of which is Autistic. Thank you to the CTA staff!! Job well done!'

464,3 star rating,"Jan 13, 2009","Yes, the rate increase sucks - but even the cost of socks and water has gone up.  I think the CTA has so many more UPS and DOWNS than anything else in this city.  I've waited one hour one day, and one minute the next.  I've been rained on by leaky escape hatches in the ceiling, spit-up on by babies who can't handle the bumpiness of Division St near Cabrini Green, spilled on, grinded on... and the list goes on.  However I do feel that the bus service has spruced up on my routes, I never have to wait long for the Blue line, and bus service has gotten quite better as well.  Customer Service can use a few more training courses, but we know that that Chicago attitude is going to come out when cornered either way.  I know mine does!  I find myself on the side of the bus drivers more often - calling in complaints on cabs who make my morning coffee spill, and who make me bounce a seat up when they cut us off and the bus tries to pop a wheelie!  In a nutshell, the CTA isn't that bad for me anymore.  I know I'll be right here again, updating on all my experiences!"
465,3 star rating,"Mar 13, 2007","Convenient and can take you anywhere in the city you want to go.  BUT the bus routes are quite illogical and it would make more sense to run in agrid pattern instead of having eight different Michigan Avenue routes that turn in different areas or weave in and out of streets going east and west.  Many CTA workers have no knowledge of how to get from one place to another if you ask, some times there tend to be many technical problems.  The last three times I rodethe train, the train stopped for no good reason for 20-45 minutes depending on the day.  And last time, it stopped for about 35 minutes with no reason and I had a plane to catch. I am convinced that CTA cannot keep a schedule if they stapled one to their ass three hundred times, and it often gets quite dirty, moldy, and stinky.  I couldn't tell you how many times I rode and saw ridiculous people spitting wads of sunflower seeds on the floor and already saw a cup of pudding spilled and smeared all over a seat before 8am.  Friggin pudding on a seat before 8?  What the hell is that about?  Oh and you gotta love those panhandlers with the shell game claiming to be from the CTA recreational department.  Meanwhile they keep raising the prices."
466,3 star rating,"Mar 25, 2006","The CTA has suffered from funding issues and image problems in the past, but they are working hard to fix their budget and route issues. Overall, I'm fairly pleased with the public transportation system: it thoroughly blankets the city, and you are rarely more than a couple blocks' walk from a bus or train line. During rush hour, the red line is a bit notorious for running slow. There are certainly some colorful weirdos on the train lines (there seems to be less weird people on the buses, but they exist in both places) - share your nutty CTA stories at www.ctatattler.com - but coming from a part of the country where there was no public transportation, I really like the ""L"". Most of the time I feel pretty safe using it, but, like any big city public transit system, you should use common sense and safety measures, especially later at night. The best value, due to the new raise in fares ($2 for cash fare) is the CTA card, which looks like a credit card, but you pre-load it online, and using it gives you the old fare cost of $1.75.

467,2 star rating,"Aug 16, 2009","The first thing I noticed when riding the CTA buses and trains is that they are far cleaner than in most cities.  Nonetheless, there is a large room for improvement when it comes to the convenience and promptness of the transportation.  If you're waiting at a bus stop for the 146, 147, and 151 for instance, you may see five 151 buses, and three 147 buses before you ever get the 146.  It can be very aggravating.  Also, it would be nicer if they had more train lines.  In most cases, you have to take 2 buses to get to your destination in terrible Chicago traffic.  Fact is, the train stops are scarce and in order to make transfers you have to go downtown to the Loop, which can be very inconvenient.  Also, you can wait on a station at the Loop that serves 4 different lines and never know when your train will get there.On the bright side, the bus drivers are very friendly for city employees.  I've been on buses in many major cities in the US and Latin American countries and Chicago has the friendliest drivers by far."
468,5 star rating,"Aug 20, 2006","in LA, public transportation is nonexistant because everyone drives. in the bay area you have BART, but in my case, you have to drive 20 mintues to the BART station in order to use it. so count your blessing chicago because CTA is amazing! it isnt New York's subway system, but it's a close second! it's easier to use since all the lines are determined by color. but unfortunately, you cant go everywhere. yes, its crowded, comes when it pleases, and smells like a big orgy, but it serves wonders. you get to wind through tall buildings and peep into peoples' rooms while on your way to work. and the ride is quite beautiful going through the loop at dusk/sunset. great photo opportunities!"
469,1 star rating,"Jul 21, 2009","WARNING to tourists from the suburbs who want to be ""green"" and take public transportation:  the ""Museum Campus"" bus, number 130, which goes from the two suburban rail stations (Union and Ogilvie) to Shedd Aquarium, Field Museum, and Adler Planetarium and back STOP RUNNING BEFORE THE MUSEUMS CLOSE.  This is ridiculous, but true.  We exited the Shedd Fri., July 16 when it closed at 6 p.m. and made our way to the bus stop.  The sign says the #130 runs until ""late afternoon.""  Why? It makes no sense not to serve the crowds until 6:30.  We were not alone in being stranded there, and the out-of-towners were not impressed with Chicago's hospitality!  We had to take the #146 bus, the only option, which took us north on State Street, then walk east to the station.  Of course, we missed the train we'd planned to take.  But, RTA is much better scheduled, so we had only to wait for the next train."

474,4 star rating,"Dec 11, 2007","Most days I love the CTA. I don't have a car and it's the only way I have to get around town (besides cabs which are super expensive and generally life threatening).  There are a lot of problems, esp with regards to funding, but I believe they are doing the best they can. The renovated brown line stations are very nice and the closures are only mildly inconvenient (I now take a bus or 2 instead). The worst time is during peak hours, but during the off hours I have no problems. The bus drivers are nice, generally on time (within 5 minutes most days) and most are helpful. They have to deal with unruly customers, bad drivers on the road, and getting yelled at by the people who check to see if they are running on time. (I realize 'bus bunching' is bad but so is someone stopping you, yelling at you because your schedule is off, then having your customers get off and transfer to another bus so you can sit there and get back on schedule). I come from a much smaller city with a much more unreliable bus system (despite better funding) so I'll take the CTA any day :) (besides $75/month for unlimited trains and buses beats $250/month just to park a car in the garage)."
475,2 star rating,"Mar 19, 2010","For when you can find a good seat it's OK, But when you have to stand at many times, It can be a hassle. Many times the employees can be less than cordial & The bureaucracy overcharges for it's less-than-average service & upkeep. But many times can be convienient."
476,5 star rating,"Apr 25, 2013","The CTA is Great. It`s One of the Oldest in the country (The L) and they have been adding New Cars and Busses at a Great Pace. They have repaired 35% of the track in slow zones and continue to and they are replacing the OLDEST stations with Brand new ones that have escalators, Elevators, some stores and alot more. Pretty cool to have the History of the ""L"" but with all the new Equipment and Stations."
477,4 star rating,"Jul 24, 2014","I have been an avid rider of the CTA for many years and I have seen a lot on the trains and buses. What I have an issue is the constant complaining people are doing about VENTRA. Yes they're having to still work out bugs in the system, but there's no reason for people complaining about CTA changing to a new fare payment system. Chicago is not the only city most of the major cities with actively used public transportation systems are upgrading to more current payment methods. I like how you can use your debit or credit card to put money on your VENTRA card. What I have a problem with is the fact that people are confused still as to what to do when they're putting money on the card and creating long lines. I am glad they changed the system it shows that CTA is keeping current with technology. People however were informed of this change more than two years ago and were given ample time to prepare for this and to know that stations were to begin removing the transit card machines. Another issue CTA has is overpacking the buses and trains because they keep packing train cars and buses after it's reached maximum capacity and it's not safe to have them like this. They also need to have posted notices informing those who travel with strollers to fold these things up so it frees up space for other passengers to sit down or stand comfortably, CTA also needs to rid the subways of the homeless and mentally ill  who take up residence there harassing customers waiting on the train. Some stations could be a little cleaner. Overall service is pretty decent."
478,1 star rating,"Jun 28, 2013","OK,  today is the blackhawks rally in downtown.  Projected 2 million people.  One would think that the CTA would run a ""special"" schedule (More trains?) to handle the additional people.  On my way to work.  Got to my Orange line platform at 8:08am.  First train was jammed, second as well.  Train platform was full of people and more getting off buses and on the escalators.  The CTA complains about how they don't have enough money for operations.  How about running the system better that what you have been doing up to this point?  The CTA acts like a person on welfare, I am handed money I have no reason to improve myself.  Try running with no gov't money and see how long you can last.  Time to get my bike working again."
479,1 star rating,"Oct 28, 2013",Ventra is the biggest scam. I hate you CTA
480,4 star rating,"Oct 3, 2013","I stopped by here earlier today b/c my Chicago card expired and I had a balance left that I needed to transfer.  Ideally, I would have transferred it to a Ventra card but I was unable to do that at this location.  All they could do was transfer the balance onto another Chicago card which is fine because I only have $13 left and I'll easily use it before the obsolete date of Nov 15.  My ventra card should be mailed and I then can load it as I wish.  I gave this branch of our government a 4 star rating because the employees were terrific and kind and nice.  I know it's a hard job dealing with the public but they showed patience and understanding which is worth noting and publishing.  The office is located on the corner of Lake and Des Plaines (I believe) or near there.  I know it's 567 Lake.  There's some street parking.  I was able to find a spot next to the Starbucks.  I don't know how the Ventra transition/employees will be.  They were located in the RTA building and I did not go there today.  Maybe in the future is something comes up with my Ventra card.  For the record, I will miss my Chicago card."
481,1 star rating,"Feb 19, 2014",The CTA is unreliable and slow.  Buses are crowded and the whole experience is terrible every time I ride the bus.  Bus drivers seem patient but it is just a real hassle and the buses never come at a consistent rate of time.  Walking generally is the best way to get around in the city.  If you ride the bus and want to get to work on time you should leave yourself plenty of cushion time because chances are you will be late wherever you are going.
482,3 star rating,"Jul 6, 2013","If you are going to a city with public transportation, you should use its public transportation. Not only is public transportation an easy system to figure out (hint: they're pretty much all the same, you only have to ""figure it out"" once, plus they're cheaper and generally more convenient than driving), hotels are less expensive the farther out of a city you stay (financial incentive!). Compared to New York's public transportation, Chicago's is definitely cleaner, and the announcements/general catering to the laymen public is much more prevalent. The system is more or less intuitive, although as a consumer of the MTA I am used to the ""swipe card"" system, and Chicago's ""input card"" system took me a second to figure out. Chalk it up to user error rather than an inherent flaw in the system itself. We are creatures of habit, after all. Regardless, if you are traveling to Chicago I would fully recommend that you take ten minutes extra and learn the public transportation system, and then use it. You will save so much time in the end, and think of all the extra site-seeing you will do!"
