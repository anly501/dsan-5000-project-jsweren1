4,2 star rating,"May 17, 2023","For out of state visitors, MBTA ferry website information has a LOT to be desired. The ferry docking station by the airport appears to have multiple names. Ferry people don't offer senior or disabled discounts that are available (especially when it's very obvious). Not the friendliest employees, and customer service on phone isn't much better. Desert dwellers as myself are NOT always familiar with ferry/boating terms and pickup/drop off locations. Trying to schedule ferry trip from airport to Hingham or Hull is clear, but trying opposite direction from Hull or Hingham goes to a different named ferry location. Same location but two different names used depending upon coming out going????? Finally got on ferry after several hour wait, no actual schedule posted, only to be dropped off at wrong town, and expensive taxi ride was needed. Websites too confusing and format not cell phone friendly. ..... BUT .... I can assure you that the shuttle bus drivers are EXTREMELY nice and helpful. Staff at Logan airport very friendly and helpful.Staff at Hingham airport NOT SO MUCH. Not every out if town visitor had travel guides or itineraries mapped out. Be a little kinder."

He was so helpful and friendly and set a great example of how good humans should act! A person had found my phone on the bus and turned it in to Israel who held it for me and answered my many phone calls tryingto coordinate when to come get it. He was always polite and very patient.  There are some great people there at MBTA!  I'm extremely grateful and hope that sharing my positive experience with others will bring a new light. Many thanks!

20,1 star rating,"Sep 4, 2023","Pretty bad it is no lower option. I am taking the train for years. The other day at North Station I wanted to buy a ticket for train one way. If you do not know North Station than you should know that this station is very involved with tracking people who do not pay- but not with the quality of the service, they provide to customers. Therefore no one can go in the waiting area without a ticket - good thing I believe - and no one can get out from the arriving trains area without scanning the ticket- not a good think. People wait in line in the morning to scan the tickets- scanners do not work well so we all are trap there waiting in long lines. No one care about our time and safety I might say. And all for catching few evaders at the expense of all the rest of us. Does not matter that trains are late, signals problems all the time even thou for years federal money were drawn for so call improvements. Trains are late all the time, and no one cares.But the other day something new happened. No employee was at the 30 or so gates to help customers and be able to buy a ticket. So I went to buy a ticket -one way- at the booth.  Each of the two booths open had a person they already were in a process to finish their transaction, but no one was waiting. So, I start waiting a few feet away from one both- the person at the booth seems that was almost done. Which she was. She left and when I got at the booth the employee refused to sell me ticket under the pretext that I did not wait in line. In the meantime, while I was waiting another person came and now, he was waiting too to buy ticket. I explain her that when I arrived no one was waiting so that person came after me. She did not ask the person if he found me there, but she continue to refuse to sell me a ticket. I did tell her I will lose the train which- thanks to MBTA is only one every hour- and she continue to refuse to sell the ticket and send me back inline which by now there were 3-4 people. Finally, she got my 20$ and give me a ticket. When I checked the ticket, she gave a ticket for a longer trip with the train then I told her I need: actually, the maximum she could charge for that train even if repeatedly I told her I want a ticket for zone 6.When I mention that the change and ticket are not correct and I am not traveling to the end of the line she told me to get them back to her. Which I did and hope she will give me the correct ticket. NO!. She gave me the 20$ back and sent me back in line again. Even If I told her my train will leave in less than 5 minutes, she refused to sell me a ticket. I finally left hoping that I will find an employee at the gate who will sell me a ticket and will not have to wait another 1h for next train. I did find someone which sold me a ticket and I was able to get in time to the train. From train, I did call customer service and complain about this vicious and unprofessional attitude . They told me they will investigate. I guess they still do since 2 weeks pass from even  and had not heard back from them. However, 2 days after event, I saw a supervisor and I asked him about this incident. He knew and he told me they are investigating. They will look at the camera footage. I hope they do. Apparently, this employee told them that I left the booth and come back - which it is not true - lying to justify her appalling behavior."
21,1 star rating,"Sep 19, 2022","After three years, the and an Orange Line month long shut down, I can tell you the train is the worst it has ever been. The trains have been updated, with most of them (if not all) being of the newer model. The problem, however is that the MBTA remains consistent in it's overwhelming mission to make public transportation the worst option for anyone to take.I got on the Roxbury Crossing train at 4:40 PM today and thought I could make it to Malden Center by 5:15 PM, and I could not have been more wrong. It was cutting close, I knew the risks, but I was hopeful the month long shutdown would bring some much needed improvements. After all, it's not like the orange line routinely shut down for sections at a time on weekends over the last decade... anyways - we reached North Station at 5:05 and I was still hopeful I could make my time. By 5:25 we still hadn't made it to Assembly. This is 2 stops after North Station, just to put it into perspective. We may legitimately be moving at 10 mph at most currently. Why waste the time writing a review? Well my friends, I'm actually still on the train right now. It's about 5:40 PM and we still have not arrived at Malden Center. I could have finished all the Lord of the Rings movies by now.Cheers, folks! To another decade of mediocrity from the MBTA."
22,1 star rating,"Apr 3, 2019","The MBTA's singular job is to disappoint you on a daily basis. They routinely excel at wasting your time and making you late. They are consistent, I will surely give them that. There has never been a service that shows as much of a disregard for their customers, and it is because they know that 95% of us depend on them and have no other viable option. We were told to get off the train at Wellington and to take a shuttle bus to oak grove. After waiting for ten minutes with no shuttle, we are told that the train is now coming and to get back on. 15 minutes later, the train to oak grove arrives. So we sit on the train and wait, and wait, and wait... and 30 minutes later we finally start to move.In summary, the MBTA is the greatest at being the worst. Knowing that their customers have no other choice, they exploit that fact to provide the worst possible service while still increasing their fares at a regular rate. If I could avoid taking the train ever again, I would be forever grateful. Unfortunately, I must face this nightmarish crapshoot of a service almost every single day."

Today I waited approximately 45 minutes to get from Quincy Adams to Quincy Center. Now I am late to work.  It takes  less time to drive to Providence RI than take the T. I find this absolutely ridiculous. You need to get your act together and provide actual service. People depend on the T. I  think that the cost should be lowered or free until the issues are resolved.
26,1 star rating,"Jul 17, 2023",This is an extremely poorly run and fairly incompetent transportation system. They advertise all summer long to switch from car commute to train/subway/bus in order to allow construction on major tunnels in Boston and avoid traffic and yet have major delays on subway lines causing you to miss trains. I've only been commuting via MBTA for three weeks and have already missed two trains due to two separate subway delays (I got on the subway a good 40 minutes before my train left north station and still missed it) and have also had one train cancelled shortly before boarding and another train delayed shortly before boarding. I would rather rot in traffic than take this commuter service and will not be renewing my monthly pass. I shouldn't have to pay almost 400 a month to then pay for an Uber to get me to the north station to catch my train on time because the subway can't stick to a schedule. As I'm writing this my commuter train is sitting at the station 20 minutes late for departure and we've just been asked to deboard and board on another track. The MBTA oozes incompetence.

My day started at 3:00. It was a short walk. There was a couple of people outside waiting to get in. My train was supposed to leave at 4:45am. I remembered that there was another entrance without having to go thru building. So I walk down a little and there it was. I like to use bathrooms before I get on a train cause sometimes there's no bathroom on train. Apparently you are only allowed inside if you're a Amtrak ticket holder. Understandable. But if you share the tracks with another train, in this situation mbta, and I have my ticket. I should be able to use bathroom too. Security was very nice about it, I was allowed to use bathroom."

36,4 star rating,"Nov 11, 2019","Seeing all the negative reviews, the first thing I am thinking is, why?Sure, the trains are packed, but that is a good thing! That means people are using this system to the fullest, and I mean the fullest!The Boston T (which I predominantly rode everywhere while in Boston) is the oldest subway system in the United States (even older than the New York City subway). It has three subway lines, the Red Line, the Blue Line, and the Orange Line, and one extensive light rail line, the Green Line (which acts like a subway downtown). There is also a commuter rail and a rapid bus service (the Silver Line), but I will be focusing on the T in this review.The T is a first-generation subway, which for those that are unfamiliar, is a subway system that was built before the advancement of the automobile and the interstate highway system. This falls in line with three other subway networks in the United States; the aforementioned New York City Subway, the Chicago ""El"", and the SEPTA Subway. Each of these systems were built with extensive station stops to accommodate large groups inasmuch as there was not a way to do so before the 1940's and 1950's. That is why the train infrastructure is older, the trains more frequent, and stops are closer together. But it also explains why it is better than something say like, Atlanta's MARTA, or Washington, DC's Metro. Those two systems are second-generation subways, or systems built to supplement the automobile, rather than act like one. But back to the T.I really liked the fact that they offer several passes to make it easy to travel without spending a lot of money. The maps are easy to understand, and connections are easy and fluid. If I had to nitpick on one thing I did not like, it was that the turnstiles are often broken, and that presented problems while trying to get into some of the stations. At least there were employees willing to assist at most of the stations where possible.If you come to Boston, definitely do not plan on taking a car everywhere. Traffic stinks, parking is worse. Use the T."
37,4 star rating,"Oct 20, 2021","There is a real chasm in the reviews here for MBTA - Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority.  If you look at the source(s) of this, decent reviews seem to be written by out-of-towners and marginal reviews seem to come from the locals.MBTA means you don't need to have a car in Boston.  That seems to hold true for the locals as well as those visiting.  MBTA is often referred to as the ""T,"" especially if referring to its rail routes.  The routing is fairly logical and there are four rail lines:  three of them are heavy rail, meaning they use subway type cars, and one is a trolley type line.  Understanding the lay of the land with respect to the three subway lines is doable while the more trolley-like Green Line can be perplexing.  It fans out from downtown to go to 4 different terminuses, so you will have to pay attention to the train's signage.  (One of the terminuses is Chestnut Hill, which means Boston College.)  The Green Line is obviously also the oldest line in the system.  Once you're done with college - at least undergraduate studies - college kids can be annoying ... and Boston has a lot of colleges!  The good thing is that they are mostly in different places and rail seems to reach many of them - B.U., Boston College, Suffolk, UMass Boston down south, and Harvard and MIT in Cambridge, among others.  Harvard (Square), on the Red Line, is an interesting station where there are always performers and, well, characters.Visually, the system map is somewhat easy to grasp, while that of Washington DC is not so easy to grasp and that of New York City is a hopeless case. Unlike with many other urban transit systems, the rail cars are painted in the color of the line.  That means you'll have blue, red, and orange subway cars and green light rail cars.   Another interesting thing is that, on the subway cars, the seating faces inward, with seats only along the windows, while on the Green Line, the seats are lined up in rows, like one typically sees.All the lines come into downtown Boston.  At several stations, such as Downtown Crossing, Government Center, and State, various lines come through them and seem to be stacked on different levels.  It's as compact as Boston itself and feels very different from, say, MARTA or BART, where suburban stations have big parking lots.MBTA runs the trains, buses, and some ferries.  Commuter trains to further out suburbs use a much different pricing structure and are more expensive.  I've ridden on a few of the buses.  I wouldn't say that the bus drivers were rude, like some people are claiming.  A better word might be crusty.  Crusty doesn't bother me, but rude does.  Of the ferries, the ones a tourist is more likely to use are the ones from downtown to Charlestown, which is how you might return after walking the Freedom Trail instead of doubling back on it, as well as the one from downtown to Boston Logan Airport (BOS).  Also, MBTA runs free normal sized shuttle buses around waterside BOS Airport so you can connect to the water shuttle or to the subway.  BOS actually has an MBTA station called - you guessed it - Airport, on the Blue Line, which is next to the airport instead of in it.  This is commendable because, at Washington-Dulles Airport, rail will be arriving there soon, after about 40 years, and, in NYC, there is no subway to La Guardia Airport and the inexpensive ""milk train"" A train that went all around Brooklyn to Howard Beach in Queens, from which you could take a free shuttle to JFK, is gone and you now use pricey AirTrain to get to JFK via public transit.  So, Boston has the airport smartly connected to the the city center and many key places.For this being Boston, MBTA's fare structure is acceptable.  A single ticket on rail is $ 2.40.  There are also things called Charlie cards (which probably sounds great when said with a New England accent).  The daily card isn't a bargain, but it's easier to go that route than buy individual tickets.  The weekly card, on the other hand, is nicely priced.  It appears that the day or multi-day Charlie cards are not usable on the ferries.  I was told that they were, and then found out otherwise.  Nevertheless, you will want to ride on at least one ferry because the skyline and harbor views are captivating.The MBTA system is a workhorse and it does a lot.  It isn't ridiculously priced and it's convenient, so that's why people pack into it.  But at some times during the day, it has empty seats and it's almost relaxing to ride the subway.  MBTA stands for four words, and I think that, independent of isolated skirmishes, some eccentricities, and an oddity like a pandemic, MBTA is worthy of four stars."
38,4 star rating,"Mar 19, 2019","Not to be confused with MBA Boston which if you're lucky will be from Harvard or MIT rather than Boston College or Community College.These old trains in Boston will get you around and pretty close to a lot of the serious action which is an excellent element of them, although they are very old and very run down and they stop running kind of early.I appreciate them, especially in cold weather, but then again Boston is very walkable so I'm not sure how totally necessary they are.It's a great part of the city because a lot of cities bigger than Beantown don't have anything like this. The traffic in Boston is still pretty awful so this is an excellent alternative and if they were just a little bit more modern and less creaky and old then I would give him a higher rating."

And frankly, all of them are easier to navigate and easier to ride than this here Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority.Granted, the Charlie Card is an improvement over the carnet they have in Paris but the London Oyster Card works better. And the Blue Line sure as hell doesn't squeal nearly as much as the Q train as it rides under Manhattan but the Paris system runs on rubber tires. And yes, the London system shuts down at around 1 AM just like Boston but New York runs all night! And hell yes, all of the MBTA is one zone which makes it a heck of a lot easier to work out how much it costs (yes, London is SEVEN fricking zones).But all of those negatives add up to, uh, where was I going with this, a system that sucks.

But the busses.. different story. I usually take the 105 and I realized how unfairly route 105 is treated. It gets at most 1 bus an hour compared to other nearby lines which get a bus every 15 minutes or less. Yea yea revenue but dam really restricting to 1 hour and 20 minutes?

My blind 96 year old Mother had to wait two hours for this Mickey Mouse operation to bring her back to her Rehabilitation Facility. My Mother had a stroke and went to Boston to see a specialist and it turned out to be an all day affair back to her rehabilitation facility just waiting for THE RIDE.  It was just a good thing that my husband was with her because I am not sure where she would have ended up. When they did finally arrive they did not have the bus so The Ride sent an ambulance to pick her up.  Thank you very much for The Roller Coaster Ride

62,2 star rating,"Nov 17, 2020","I have never felt the need to sanitize myself more than after a quick ride on the orange line on the T. The train car looked outdated and smelled of weed and cigarette smoke when we entered it. The interior can definitely use some updating - changing the wood paneling on the walls would go a long way. The seats looked as if the original fabric was still on there and they were filthy and stained. The exterior of the train needs a good power washing to get rid of the layers of stuck on grime and dirt.After this ride, my friend and I walked to a local pharmacy to spray Scrubbing Bubbles on our clothes and we washed our hands like crazy to get rid of all of the germs."

After many days and many attempts, I finally was connected with a live person today.  She didn't even ask about putting me on hold ... I heard a computer voice say ""please hold"" and I was on hold again for over 20 minutes.  I have a full-time job and other things to manage.  I really cannot tell you how much time I have wasted trying to get help from The Ride.When we have been forced to use them - out of necessity - my disabled Veteran husband sometimes requires rides, when I am not available - they are late to pick-up.  They are horrible about dropping him off in the right location.  If I had other choices, believe me, I would make them.  In fact, I will be using Uber tomorrow, as I cannot get a hold of The RIde (I've been trying since last Thursday) to schedule a simple pick-up @ a location and drop-off @ home.  It's horrible.  If I ever do reach someone at The Ride (please, don't send me to their website, we cannot login to our account because ""it's a new system"" I was told via an email) I am going to ask for a full refund of any money that we may still have on the account.  The Ride - you are a terrible excuse for a service that is supposed to help disabled, elderly, challenged people.  I really don't know how you get by with remaining in business."

On top of that they are increasing price on July. Constantly Trains on standbys and let's not even talk about how bad his services are. There is so much for them to improve. People won't mind paying for the service but how can they increase price and keep providing mediocre service.

Compared to other cities this system is pretty straightforward but unfortunately run down and in need of repair. Several stations had broken elevators which brings up that this is one of the most handicapped unfriendly subway systems I've ever seen. We had person who walks in other difficulty and the complete lack of elevators or even escalators is disappointing.

I said""It is a public space, I can look anywhere I want"". Then he started to punch my head back. He is smart and know he should not punch my face. I did not fight back because I am afraid it could result in more severe accident. After some passengers stop, this AA man stopped. Then the MBTA commuter train conductor started to come. He just asked me to leave this cart and stay in the space between two carts. He left the black man to stay in the card even I was the victim. Then he left me and the black guy at the stop of W Medford and said he called the police. After around a half hour, two policemen came. One is a young white and one is a young Asian/Latino. The white asked me questions and the latino asked this black man. I did not know what the black man answers the questions. The white man simply asked me what was going on and he even said I should not go to the court because it would hard to explain because he said I should fight back even though I did for God's sake. Also, my face was all right since the black man only punched my head back. Then this black man only said sorry to me and then the two policemen left and let the black man and me wait for the next train. As being an Asian man, I have been treated unfairly many times not only this time but many other occasions."

72,1 star rating,"Jul 29, 2018","The commuter rail trains are terribly outdated and often run 30 min - 1 hr late or more due to mechanical or switch issues. The app associated with the mbta supposedly lists up-to-date alerts, but the alerts are never updated to reflect estimated times that trains will arrive late, only a range like '30-50 min late' or unspecified. Even if a train is late by an hour, passengers still need to pay, which is ridiculous"

When I tried to contact the parking services they use, they go through a third party, which when you call them to fix your issue, they redirect you back to the MBTA. I was literally calling the same three numbers in circles and no one was helping me. This was the worst customer service I have ever tried to use. Avoid the MBTA at ALL COSTS."

No 24 hour service for a city like this?Really?That helps killing the night life in Boston witch is already little to non existant.

83,1 star rating,"Oct 23, 2020","To compare the MBTA bus system to that of a 3rd World country would be an insult to 3rd World countries. Pre-COVID you could stand on a corner on any given morning and watch 3 buses on the exact same route roll down the street back to back. No joke, 1 bus would be overflowing with people and the other 2 would be completely empty. Buses show up whenever they want; late, early, whenever the driver gets around to driving their route. If you live outside of Boston, Cambridge or Somerville good luck getting anywhere, and the city complains about all the cars on the road. And it's not like the T or Commuter Rail are much better either. They've clearly got a bunch of jokers running the MBTA."

Both buses are usually delayed, never properly linked together (so you always miss one!) and always overcrowded. Best of luck if you try to use the bus to get to work on time on Saturdays! 66 comes by maybe once an hour.Trains aren't that better either. Usually dirty, smelly, also full. Also, DON'T bother using the online service to add money to your card. Doesn't work typically. Waste of money!"

My train broke down 35 minutes from my destination, I had to get out and get different means of transportation after multiple indefinite delay announcements.  Later, I found out that the train was permanently delayed.  They also have a new policy that if the train breaks down for any reason, mechanical, weather, track issues or if the train never leaves, etc....that THEY DON'T OFFER REFUNDS!!  Unbelievable to think of a company being able to charge for services they DO NOT EVEN PROVIDE, and having a BLANKET NO REFUND POLICY.  I created a claim requesting a refund (only for the ticket price) to help recover some of my rideshare cost, talked to a customer service agent, and even asked to talk to a supervisor which I was promised would call me within 24 hours...Wasn't surprised to never hear from them.Two thumbs down...if this happens to anybody, please just dispute the MBTA charge via your credit card, they will refund you for failure to provide goods promised."

89,3 star rating,"Aug 14, 2015","MBTA reminded me of Toronto (TTC) in some ways. The frequencies, in theory, are good for a city of its size, but its execution is quite poor. From a tourist point of view, it does its job in terms of providing information for a tourist to navigate the system, however there were definitely flaws I found in the network.The most noticeable issue was the signaling system. I rode the Red Line into Boston during rush hour, but we were literally inching between Harvard and Park Street to the point it took 20 minutes just for that section. There was also quite a noticeable gap ahead of us (I waited 4 mins for my train at Harvard), so I wasn't sure what the holdup was. The Orange Line, on the other hand, suffered from quite a bit of bunching, with 14 min waits during the height of rush hour, then trains coming in 1-2 min successions.Then there was the Green Line...an excellent idea for a LRT (it's even displayed on the T map for gods sake), but it's way over capacity. Getting on the Green Line at Park Street was like trying to squeeze in a Yamamote train in Shinjuku.I only tried the Washington Street portion of the Silver Line, and similarly there was quite a lot of bunching, with 15-20 min gaps then 3 buses coming at once. I will say though, it's a great idea for the Silver Line to be displayed on the T map, even though it's barely a passable BRT system.Some of the stations were set up quite well, such as the Park Street Red Line platform (Spanish solution), Harvard (wide platforms), and North Station (Orange and Green Lines on the same platform). The ticket machines are quite easy to understand, but don't forget to purchase a free CharlieCard if you want to save money!Overall the MBTA reminds me of the TTC back home. Its frequency and technology (to an extent) are there, but its reliability can be questioned."

91,1 star rating,"Oct 19, 2016","I felt very humiliated by a MTBA worker at the Boylston Station today. I was carrying heavy groceries in both hands, tapped my MONTHLY PASS at the entrance, heard the beep but the door did not open. I tapped again but got the ""card already used"" message because MBTA prevents people from sharing the same card. I remembered I was told to or read somewhere that just walk behind someone if this happened(yes, I know I could be totally wrong here). So I followed the next person and got in. This MTBA worker emerged from the a booth looking furious. He immediately start yelling at me for sneaking in without paying. I told him I tapped my card but the door didn't open. He kept saying something in line with ""did you just walk in behind someone?"" I told him again that I tapped the card but door didn't open, and it didn't even matter because I had a monthly pass anyway. However, he continued to act really pissed off and made me walk out of the entrance (I was carrying a lot of groceries on both hands), and threatened to write me a ticket if I was lying. So I had to walk out, but for some unknown reason he pulled out his cellphone and started to make a phone call meanwhile I was standing outside of the gate looking at him. I kept tapping my pass at the door multiple times desperately trying to show him that I had a monthly pass. He looked at me but was still on his phone call (maybe he was calling the police to arrest me). Eventually, he got off the call and opened the gate but still blamed me for not waving at him first. In my defense, first, usually there is no one sitting in the booth at this hour of day. And second, his booth was dim. It was impossible to tell if someone was in there. It seems that he was quick to spot me ""sneaking in"" but too slow to know that I was tapped my card couple of times and the door never opened.Even if it was all my fault for walking in behind someone and even if this was all just a misunderstanding, he didn't have to act so dramatically like a bully and ignored me while I wait outside of the entrance to get in.I felt extremely humiliated and emotional as if I was falsely caught stealing. All the other passengers at Boylston looked me probably thinking I was being caught trying skipping a $2.50 fare. In an ideal world, he should be apologizing to me because MBTA's gates malfunctioned and caused inconvenience for me. Next time when the MBTA door doesn't open, I know I have only these options. 1. Wave at the booth and try to get a MBTA worker's attention even if he was focusing on his cell phone screen, praying he actually raises his head. 2. If there is no one sitting in the booth at the moment or the MBTA worker was too devoted to his/her cellphone, then consider your fare wasted. Go buy another ticket. 3. In my case, since I have a monthly pass, I will have to wait for another 20 mins (10mins? I don't know exactly how long it takes) so my pass can be tapped again. Pray that the gate opens for you this time. Update: although I appreciate the upvotes, I don't find this incident funny( well, maybe a little bit). I'm still mad thinking about it now. Every time I walked into Boylston and saw that booth, this incident came back to me. It's like having PTSD! I fixed some bad grammar because I was very emotional when I typed this review the first time."

NOW, the nitwit ticket takers have begun announcing that, for everyone's safety, people should be seated!

The Keolis run commuter rail service, which costs quite a lot to use, is an unmitigated disaster.  Surly conductors (including one power mad woman on the Rockport/Newburyport lines), 3 seaters that might fit three VERY SMALL children, and delays nearly every morning and/or night make for a dismal commuting experience.  The newer double decker trains have no wi-fi and very cramped quarters while the older cars frequently smell, have many replacement seats filled with what feels like concrete (watch your tailbone), and windows that are so dirty, they look like they're tinted green.   Can you say ""sucks"" on YELP?...because Keolis sucks!"
96,1 star rating,"Apr 9, 2014","Maybe this is a US mass transportation problem.  After riding on metro systems from major cities around the world, I was quite shocked in regard of the metro system they got in Boston being a major city in the most developed country of the world.I was skeptical after riding on the blue, orange, and red line, but the horror came after trying the green line.  I felt like I just time traveled back to the early 1900s.  Perhaps they kept it that way for historical reason to demonstrate one of the oldest cities in the US.The most frustration part was faulty fare gates, it popped up a message saying see staff for help, but there was not a single staff personnel in the entire station.  Then we saw a few students just walk right past a gate under maintenance without tickets, and another couple used a 1-for-2 method.  I suppose these were common practice by the locals.It is true the driving experience is terrible, but that is no excuse for a city to keep a poor metro system.  It sucks driving in many major cities around the world too, but they were able to maintain a modernized system.  Perhaps MBTA truly reflect an accurate image of the city?"

You may be scolded by a trolley driver for trying to skip out on $2.50 when you pay the $85 monthly... There are no names attached to the monthly So good luck explaining why you have a backup Charlie for emergencies"
98,4 star rating,"Sep 18, 2016","I'm a New Yorker who headed to Beantown to watch a Yankees vs Red Sox game (we lost). I took the Red line from South Station to Park Street and then I took the trolley to Kenmore. Kenmore station is roughly a 10 minute walk to Fenway. The MBTA is one of the cleanest systems that I've ever used. Most of the stations and train cars were spotless. There were a few homeless people (I don't judge other people), but they weren't aggressive like the panhandlers in the NYC subway. The trains have a tendency to bunch up. The wait times can range from 2 to 12 minutes. The trains move pretty fast. It took only 20 minutes to travel from downtown Boston to Fenway. The cars on the Red line were comfortable. The trolley, however, uses an older car model that is somewhat decrepit. Still, it got me from point A to point B.Almost every part of Boston is served by the MBTA. It goes to Fenway, Logan Airport, and two of the best universities in the world. There's even a commuter rail line that travels from South Station to Gillette Stadium. If your car tires are ""deflated"" then you can take the train to the Patriots game instead. The fare is reasonable- a one way ride is $2.75 and an all day pass is $12. The only caveat is that the MBTA shuts down between ~1 AM and 5 AM, so if you're clubbing on a Saturday night or if a Yankees vs Red Sox game goes to the 15th inning then you have to take that into consideration."
99,1 star rating,"Apr 13, 2016","Ahh the T! My old, dirty, tired, broken down, transportation buddy! Here are some of the lovely issues with the T:1. Service issues plague the subways- the Blue Line I have never had an issue with, and very few with the Red. Orange line is a nightmare and always breaking, so is the Green Line, but that's because it runs on old trolley lines.2. The commuter rail. I ride this daily. Among the issues are switching problems, Amtrak delays, breakdowns, and cold weather. Those super duper new locomotives hate the cold apparently. Kind of like my Ford. I ride out of North Station on the Haverhill line, which is one of the lines most on time- however, I grew up in West Concord on the Fitchburg line and that line sucks. It's constantly 15 minutes or more late. Go figure.3. Cleanliness... are the trains ever cleaned? I mean more than once a year or once every 10? They're filthy. The blue line is clean cause no one freaking rides it. Orange is super sketch and grimy (and overcrowded), Red is sorta ok, but smells a bit, Green is dirty and overcrowded. The Commuter Rail? Filthy, old, and always dirty. Do they ever wash the exterior of the cars? They look vile, and with a 40+ year old locomotive pulling the train- it's laughable at best.4. Staff. Don't get me started on the pay scale- most are unfriendly and unhelpful. Commuter rail conductors are touch and go, some are better than others- the few engineers I've spoken to are pretty cool. But the customer service department? Don't make me laugh so hard!There are more, but that's the T and people who ride it daily know the issues plaguing the transit system in this city. One stars because well it doesn't allow zero."
100,1 star rating,"Jan 31, 2011","I'm all for public transportation, and the Boston T set-up isn't that bad. I commuted to school using the Orange line for two semesters and it's usually very reliable and convenient. When the T is reliable, I don't have many complaints. I do wish there were some sort of connections between the separate Green lines (besides buses), and that it ran later than 12:30am, but that's besides the point. I'm here to talk about the commuter rail.I don't have to use the commuter rail every day (thank God), so it could be more reliable than I've experienced. Maybe I just have bad luck? Or bad karma? I dunno. I like to think of myself as a nice, compassionate person (though I do have a bit of a short temper). But still, I'm not quite sure what I've done to deserve such horrible luck with the commuter rail.Even in the fairest of weather conditions, the arrival time has always been at least 5-10 minutes later than it's scheduled to be, no matter which line I'm traveling on. Not a huge travesty, but still annoying when I have plans that require further transportation. They should really update the schedules so they're more accurate. All that aside, it's my most recent excursion that has driven me to ""create a business"" for the MBTA as a whole.I just returned home from what should have been a simple 1 hour and 10 minute trip from Providence to Boston, but I assure you 'twas not so simple. The 5:10 train made it into South Station at 9:04. And I kid you not. Check the records (if that's even possible?).Apparently something went wrong with the engine, so they spent ~75 minutes troubleshooting at South Attleboro to no avail. They then sent the next train to switch tracks and back up to our broken-down train so they could hitch the two together and tow us to Boston. Why this took another ~55 minutes to complete is beyond me. And why they made us wait outside in 12 degree weather while all this went down is even more baffling.The overall lack of updates, compassion, and hustle from the conductors is what REALLY ticked me off. When I asked for a refund, the guy smirked and told me to go to www.mbta.com ""like everyone else."" I wanted to punch him. I hope us poor passengers of train 822 will be receiving a hefty sum for our troubles, but I doubt it. I also hope that it won't be a credit for MBTA commuter rail tickets. In that case, it will just go to waste, since I will certainly be taking the Jeep (that gets 13 miles to the gallon) from now on. Forever."
101,4 star rating,"Aug 26, 2013","Maybe it's because I grew up in So. Cal. where there was no such thing as decent public transportation until recently; maybe it's because I like trains and trams and other vehicles that move a lot of people; maybe it's because I could park and ride the subway for less money and a hell of a lot less stress than driving; but I am now a huge fan of the MBTA.The two days we toured Boston we used the subway to get into the city.  We found parking for $5 per day at the end of the Blue Line.  The trip into downtown Boston takes about 30 minutes.  The cars are clean and it is pretty easy to figure out where you are and when you need to get off.The only confusion we really had was at the Government Center hub trying to figure out the Green Line.  Once we finally figured out which train we needed, it was a piece of cake to get to the Science Museum.The MBTA also appealed to my bargain side.  My wife and I purchased 7 day passes for $18 each.  While we did not need the full 7 days, and we paid $5 a day for parking, we still saved because parking in the city is outrageously expensive.  Also, I saved myself a ton of stress because driving in Boston really is pretty intense.This is a very good public transportation system.  I was happy to see that it appears to have very good ridership.  There was only one really freaky wierdo that I saw during our two days using the MBTA so it seems they keep it policed pretty well.Highly recommended public transportation if you need to get around Boston."

I do not take train in quincy for some reasons they have shuttle buses going on.

104,1 star rating,"Jan 2, 2018","MBTA Commuter Rail you have the ABSOULTE WORST customer support representative I have EVER had the misfortune of dealing with. This agent was completely useless other than the fact he insisted upon escalating the situation every chance he got. I HIGHLY recommend retraining. Every time I went to speak he would cut me off to the point that I had to state for him to stop cutting me off when I am speaking. He refused to let me speak to a manager, first stating there were none (extremely surprising to me with numerous years of  working in and managing a call center team), then stated they were busy, then stated they were there but still refused to let me speak with them. He seems unaware of basic processes and proper customer support handling. He informed me that it is not his problem nor the MBTA's issue that I was charged $281 for a monthly pass, and did not receive that pass. Also not their problem to work with my bank who i conferenced in to provide an authorization code to cancel said pending transaction. Stated that they do not have any control over said mTicket app and no one else does. He replied to the bank representative that the only way to get in contact with someone that does in fact have that power was by mail. I find it absolutely mind blowing and quite frankly a lie that you have no power over your app as you are the merchant. The representative's name was Naris. Thanks to him and by extension you I missed a day of work in office. Not to mention he stated to me in a very condescending tone ""I appreciate your determination but there's is absolutely nothing we can do"". Tip:I highly recommend not using the mTicket app since there is absolutely no one to help when things go wrong! Literally like gambling. Pray nothing goes wrong and you don't lose hundreds of dollars."

I was able to go as far as Samuel Adams Brewery and far down Back Bay and felt comfortable taking the MBTA. The only time it let me down was when I was further down the Back Bay and waiting for a bus, I was not able to find a bus and ended up having to take a taxi. It is convenient, but does not operate past 12:30am in most stations so that's not convenient if you want to go out to a bar to hang out until late. I would still recommend it as a method of transportation if you are visiting Boston as it is far more convenient than driving or taxi."
109,1 star rating,"Aug 8, 2015","YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING.....For a major metropolitan city, Boston's T subway is more nostalgia that efficiency.Haven ridden San Francisco's BART, Paris's RAR, Washington D.C.'s Metro - the T SUBWAY is a JOKE.The ticket machines are hard to understand and negotiate. The home screen shows purchase values of $5, $10 and other. A round trip pass costs $5.30, but in order to pay $5.30, you must select ""other"" and enter the purchase value.Plus you cannot buy more than one pass per transaction. For a family of four, that means four separate transactions and credit card swipes.The cars are old and in disrepair.The system is not intuitive.Once underground, the signage is not clear as to the direction one must go or the next stop.In this day and age of technology and automation, the T Subway is lacking in both.The subways stations are run down and dilapidated.The few that we visited smelled of vomit, urine and homeless people.Walking through town, we walked under some of the elevated tracks. Many have substantial rust and corrosion. It is amazing that they are still standing.Got to love the ""make work"" for union operators... many rear subway cars, that are connected to a lead car - have an operator sitting at the controls. They cannot even see where they are going. They MUST be union workers....I even watched a MBTA worker allowing people to enter via the exit turnstiles.Only redeeming value - the low price reflects it's technology and efficiency.Visited July 2015"

112,4 star rating,"Jul 31, 2010","I rely heavily on public transit at home and try to do the same when I travel. I found the T extremely easy for a visitor to navigate with relatively clean trains and buses and clear signage in the stations. I wish Chicago would get on the stick add digital signs inside all of the L cars - not just the few new ones - announcing the upcoming stop and train direction. I've seen way too many tourists freak out when their stop comes up or ask you every block if they're there yet.The T got me pretty close to every place I needed to go so I can't really complain, but I will; however, my two complaints are very minor. First, it would be nice if there was a 3-day Charlie ticket - lots of people take weekend trips and it would be nice to have an option besides 1 or 7 day passes. Second, it may be temporary, but the Fenway Park stop is downright confusing. I knew it was too good to be true when I walked up to the platform without passing any fare gates. Apparently I was supposed to know I should hold my ticket up as I boarded or get on by the conductor. The conductor called out anyone she suspected of not paying (including me). The whole method seems very suspect, I didn't pay out of confusion, but the girls next to me who flashed their cards were still called out for not paying. We all ended up having to go to the front of the train to swipe our cards. I pity the fool that hates on the T; it's not perfect, but I've yet to meet a transit system that is."

122,1 star rating,"May 11, 2015","The MBTA is the pits. THE PITS!!!I'm on the Wickford Junction/Providence line which basically means we never arrive on time, the train is packed to the point of asphyxiation for most passengers and the conductors only collect until they decide they are tired. Your best bet is to get on in Sharon because usually from that point on, your ticket won't be clicked or collected (free ride!). Every, single day is a new adventure on the MBTA because you never quite know what the delay reason is. A switch problem? Mechanical issues? The tracks are too hot? They are short a conductor (heck, one time we didn't have an engineer!)? It's anyone's guess, but you're guaranteed to not get where you are going on-time. It would be great to say that this past bad winter was the only reason, but the trains run just as inefficiently when it's spring, 70 degrees and clear, blue skies. The train is dirty, the bathrooms are disgusting and many of the seats are torn, caving in or falling apart in general. Try not to touch anything, and definitely don't put your bags on the floor (no matter what they tell you). If you're lucky, you'll get to ride this train line and have an interaction with the infamous Gidget Gaines, aka the train conductor from hell. If she isn't slamming the train door in your face as you are just about to board (""People wait for trains, trains don't wait for people""), then she's either sneering at you as she collects tickets or staring you down with her ominous (and unforgettable) brow. Watch your step, people, she WILL mow you down. And in her famous words, ""Have your monies"" ready when she comes through because, you know, apparently MBTA accepts all forms of currency? Heaven forbid you're not ready, you won't make that mistake with her again. On the flip side, you aren't a true commuter until you've had a run-in with the rude and legendary Gidget. Unless you're her friend - then you get a free ride (or even use of her pass!). The prices just keep going up and the service keeps going down, down, down. Soon it will make more sense to just pay the few extra bucks to take the Amtrak into Boston. To sum it up:1) There is no such thing as on-time on the MBTA. There is DEFINTELY no such thing as an ""express"" train. Don't bother rushing to make that special train that makes less stops - it's a sham.2) It's crowded. Really crowded. You will get coughed on, stepped on, sneezed on, elbowed and will be made to suck it up as the conductors cram people onto the train so that you literally. cannot. move. Talk about fire hazards.3) While a handful of the conductors are nice and friendly, there are a fair share of rude and unfriendly types who will make this unpleasant experience even worse.4) The cost to ride this abomination of public transportation is ludicrous.

Buses are hardly ever on time or come earlier than expected which results in you having to wait for the next late bus. The drivers then take out their incompetence on passengers and make it seem like it's their fault for them being late. Also, machines hardly work for the Charlie cards/tickets. I find it ridiculous how a supposed 30 minute commute gets dragged out into one or two hours due to these drivers and their poor customer service. I can only imagine how much prices have increased over the years and how service just declines. Despicable!"

138,1 star rating,"Jan 29, 2015","This public transit system is just the worst. Annoyances include:1) trains go ""express"" randomly to not your stop. So you have to get off wait for the next one and pay again to get on.2) It is incredibly crowded at rush hour. Sometimes you can't even fit on the train.3) you get sick more often because of the close proximity to so many people.4) the drivers are, on average, quite rude and unfriendly."
139,2 star rating,"Mar 27, 2017","I ride every Monday and Wednesday during the week for an internship.The good: Usually very punctual and at the station right on time. The integration of the ticket app is also very useful for those in a rush.The bad: The internet is highly unreliable. They offer it and I've been on many different trains. I have yet to get one that does not give me internet-related issues. I work in transportation, so I know a strong signal CAN be held. The ugly: Prices. The prices keep going higher and higher. The breakdowns and malfunctions happen more and more frequently. Why? I was just delayed due to malfunctions this morning and this half-an-hour delay threw my schedule for a loop. Still took my ticket because hey, my inconvenience is of no issue for you. Again, I understand working in transportation. Mechanical things will falter, but it is clear they don't maintain these trains for the life of them. They always seem so filthy. Hey. Atleast the CEO is making money to insulate that fat head that he clearly has."
140,3 star rating,"Oct 29, 2011","An almost 50-year old system, the MBTA (Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority) controls all the buses, toll highways, commuter rail, subways, and ferries in the area.The design is simple and effective - though I would like to see entrances numbered clearly like they do in China or Taiwan, where you can really see which entry/exit you come in from, and better signage as to what's local and around the area.The Green Line reminds me of the Green Line in Philadelphia's trolley system.Can get very crowded, so be warned during the evening hours.It's cleaner than the NYC subway system, but also newer, so tough to compare.What I do like - they still do the 1-day ticket pass (good for any MBTA transportation all-day). NYC would be wise to reinstate that. $9 for all day rides. $2 a ride otherwise."

145,3 star rating,"Dec 5, 2007","Being that I live in NYC, I tend to compare the rest of the world's subway systems to our MTA, and Boston's MBTA is no exception.  The subway cars, like the city are tiny and compact.  They remind me of San Francisco rail cars that zip along the city, except underground.  When its rush hour, I can imagine each individual car being tight with people, which was the case and I was using it mainly at night.The system lines themselves are differentiated by colors, no numbers or alphanumeric combinations of any sort.  This in itself made the maps very clear and easy to understand.  Another plus to the individual stations is that they were all mostly well lit and had fans blasting during the hot summer time which is something NYC could most definitely use.  Like the MTA in NYC however, I have seen piles of vomit, piss, and trash in some areas which are putrid in odor and disappointing overall. Thank goodness the downtown part of Boston is small enough to where almost everything is in walking distance.  The city is too beautiful to spend time underground, only to wait for the occasional mini-train to pass by."

149,2 star rating,"Oct 1, 2014","Even though the t service covers the majority of Boston and students,  professionals and pretty much everyone without a car relies on it, it's not what it should be. Orange line: always packed during rush hour. So if you aren't right next to the terminal stops, don't expect to get on. If it's not rush hour, budget 15 min of just waiting for the train. After 10.30pm budget 20 min. Shuttle buses to get to Boston are absolutely exhausting. Red line: by far the best and fastest of the t. Usually on time, with a decent frequency. I'd say 3.5/5 for it. Green: horrendous frequency and slower than a biker. But the cleanest of all.Blue: takes you to the airport!  And the beachm 4/5 for that. But it could be safer. Silver: also takes you to the airport!  Decent service.Mbta: Good for getting out of Boston, but the morning schedule could be better to and from Providence on weekends. Prices keep going up and the service isn't getting better."
150,4 star rating,"Apr 22, 2014","As a visitor from a far off LALA land, the MBTA blows away anything LA has. I found this system to be much better than the NYC subway and very similar to the San Francisco Bay Area BART system. Its been way to long since I took any other local train system to recall with any certainty how it would compare to that as well.Overall the cars were decently cleaned, I wish they had had more seating though. The seats almost entirely lined the edges leaving standing room in the middle. I think it would have been a bit nicer had there been rows of seats like a bus or regular train. It was set up so that people can bring their bikes with them, except for during ""rush hour."" Pro Tip: This option is much cheaper for folks trying to go into Boston from the burbs and or from the airport if they are staying in Boston proper and don't want to rent a car.Overall the MBTA system is set up nicely and extends all over the major metropolitan area. It was definitely nice to have most of it subterranean in the city itself. The outdoor stations with open air platforms during the winter storms may really suck though. Hopefully I wouldn't have to wait for a train on one of those platforms in the midst of a blizzard. Pro Tip #2: Love that the munchkins can ride for free... Mine definitely enjoyed the ride and I loved that it was free for her.I also liked that the system was set up to easily swap trains and for a very cheap price overall. Using the Charlie card with a preset rate regardless of distance is a bit different but worked fine for me. This certainly made it easier than trying to calculate total costs and putting that much on a card. Generally I did enjoy taking multiple trips on this system and was pleased with its efficiency and frequency. I suggest that you give it a go to, regardless of if you are a local or a tourist."
151,4 star rating,"Sep 3, 2013","I have a love hate affair with transit systems like this. Part of me really likes them, part of me realizes how unconvenient that they can be, and part of me thinks that the price (subsideized and otherwise) are not worth it. I think that the parking situation for some of the stops on this route were beyond atrocious... Seriously the Malden station had a pay lot with at most 100 spaces whereas the Wellington Station had what could have been 750 or 1000! The station locations are somewhat sensical, however, if they had really wanted to increase ridership and lessen traffic, wouldnt they have bigger lots and built them to cruise alongside of the freeways?Pro Tip: You purchase a round trip with each use at $2.50 ea direction. This is by far cheaper than parking in Boston itself.Overall though its a pretty good system. It is about a million times cleaner than the NY Subway, its not half as unsightly as the Chicago El, runs with the efficiency of SF Bay Areas BART and it is much more userfriendly than the London Underground. So it is a plus in my opinion. Pro Tip #2: Children under 12 are able to ride for free! Very nice perk!Many of the elevators and escalators seemed to be under repair. I also noticed that they would randomly send cars to a siding or reroute them on the orange green and blue lines for no reason and out of nowhere. I have never understood that kinda thing, but what are ya gonna do other than take and move on?Overall it wasnt a bad thing and helped on my trip there. I would definitely use it again if I was in the area."

When the weather is bad, the mbta tends to stop functioning even more than usual, leading to an additional half hour to your commute at least. Unfortunately mbta has a monopoly on public transportation in the greater Boston area so there's no other option unless you own a car or want to pay exorbitant rideshare prices everyday."
153,4 star rating,"May 8, 2014","Wow, what is with the hate for the MBTA here? I absolutely LOVE the MBTA; in fact, it is my one of my favorite things about Boston! The price for a monthly pass is reasonable ($70), which includes both bus and subway service. Every single thing in Boston is less than a half mile from a MBTA station.  Sometimes the distances between stops are ridiculously small; for example on the B line, there are stops on every intersection. I am from Florida; where the trains come every two hours and they are about ten miles apart.  People who cannot afford cars really suffer because they waste so much of their day on transportation, or they end up housebound. I like having control of my own day with good transport, so I definitely appreciate this service. Here are some tips to make your experience less sucky:--Buy passes at the entrance of the MBTA stations. Some stops don't have machines. In that case, pay cash fare ($2.50) and then buy a pass at another stop, or 7-11. $11 Daily Pass/$18 Weekly/$70 Monthly. --Watch how other people use their ticket first. If you put the ticket in, and you don't go in when the gate opens, your ticket won't work for another 20 minutes!!  Also, if you entered at the wrong entrance (inbound vs. outbound), don't go back outside to the other entrance, or you will get the timeout. Try to see if there's an internal staircase to switch direction.--If not, it might be better to walk then to wait for the timeout to end. Remember Boston is really small. The walking distances between the stops on the Green Line are about 5 minutes, and on the Red and Orange, about 10 minutes. Even stops on two different lines can be very close. Ex. Copley (Green) and Back Bay (Orange) look far on the map, but they are two blocks apart.-You can go between Green Line E Prudential and Orange Line Back Bay stops internally by walking through the mall. --Use apps like Moovit to get real-time info about your train or bus.--The MBTA monthly commuter passes (from Boston to other cities) INCLUDE local service, so do not buy both commuter passes and local passes.--Many employers in Boston offer free MBTA passes to their workers. So if you want to reward me for my awesome review, please consider selling me one =) Also, you can message me with any questions."

157,3 star rating,"Mar 20, 2014","I'm a part time writer. I get some of my best material from the MBTA. When I get bored with my characters, stymied with my plot lines and feel that my descriptions are stale and cliched, I can just hop onto the MBTA with my Charlie Card. (Keep in mind that I usually am headed somewhere, but the thought of random rides has occurred to me.) From the man spewing darkly fascinating Kennedy assassination theories out loud to all who care (Caroline and Teddy were responsible) to the blissfully lost tourists with their delightful enthusiasm, I have gathered all kinds of ideas for characterization. I've seen every imaginable form of body waste, every kind of poverty plea and every body type that exists. (Along with some body parts that should not be seen in public.) I've seen rude drivers, sweet drivers, near misses on the B Line, large rats, fare jumpers (very common), way too many drunks, a snake, a bird and six baby mice in a pink plastic cage. I've seen fist fights. With blood. When I am in a hurry, it's late. When I am not in a hurry, it's on time. The Green Line's brake situation must have contributed to the mild hearing loss in my right ear, which my Primary Care Provider informed me of in a raised voice last year. That's the line I use most of the time. The screeching sounds coming from the Green Line can be heard for close to 1/3 of a mile away. This is true. The prices go up, the stations shut down, the escalators get stuck, the stations are dirty, but I really have a strong affection for the MBTA. I'm glad they are staying open later for the college students, I'm glad they are fixing the Government Center Station, and I am very glad they are extending the Green Line. Thanks for all of the good times, MBTA."

But I'll do the talking - you're a gay republican and shouldn't speak.I think it's really cool that you're in charge of the oldest subway system in the country. And I really like some of things you've implemented like the convenient Charlie Card and those announcements of when trains are approaching. *Runs and pushes old ladies to make the train*But there are definitely some things you need to work on. For example, I realize we're running on a one track system so disabled trains will definitely cause delays. But howcome there are also delays when trains aren't broken down? Come stand with me outside on a January morning in Boston and experience what your passengers do. It's rush hour yet the trains may take forever to come. And when they do, there's no room to get on. No worries, we can stand and wait for 3 more trains to come before I freeze to death...no prob right? And what's the deal with those advertisements from overpaid athletes telling me to take the T? You should study marketing because when I'm standing on the platform, I'm obviously already a customer...and we all know that these Pats and Bruins players don't take the T themselves.And last but certainly not least, I have a big problem with the fact the T shuts down at 1AM. Don't you think it would be wise and SAFE to have public transit available until at least 2:30AM on Friday and Saturday? Or would you rather people drive home drunk or hop in a cab that is equivalent to driving with someone intoxicated? Just sayin'Thanks for the chat.

160,1 star rating,"Apr 2, 2008","One million NEGATIVE stars. Seriously unacceptable. Dear MBTA, I often shrug off my mishaps with the T because for the most part it's tolerable.. but what happened yesterday is completely unacceptable. I have a employee credit card for travel. If the person reading this doesn't know what that is.. it's a credit card supplied by my employer that deducts money from my paycheck monthly so that I can use it when purchasing a pass for my Charlie Card. Point is, I get it taken out of my paycheck before taxes which saves money. Yesterday, I tried to use my employee credit card, only to get two screens that said ""Transaction Canceled"". The Boston Globe salesman had to tell me the machine was broken. ""It's been broken all morning."" So, not only did it not work for me, people before me and after me were going to have issues. He pointed to an open gate and said that everyone was just going through there and to try buying a pass at another station. This has been happening for months, so I just shrugged it off. Does the T realize how much it's throwing away on the first of the month when people are strolling through those gates? After work, I went to the Boylston station to buy a pass and was once again denied. I got two screens that said ""Transaction Canceled"".. then another screen after the MBTA person came over and said that the machines were working fine. Obviously, they weren't. Or so I thought. I got on the phone with credit card company and the T employee called his ""superiors"". The CC people told me that my statement shows that I charged the card at 8:39AM that morning and so it was up to the MBTA to rectify the situation. The MBTA worker told me that his superiors told him that it was up to the credit card company to rectify the situation. No one wanted to take responsibility for the money that had somehow vanished. Because I didn't have money, I used my change to try and buy a one way ticket. Unfortunately, your machines only takes 20 coins at a time. You should definitely post that somewhere more bold. Luckily, I found a dollar and was able to make it to my appointment in Kendall Square. All out of money,  I walked home to North Cambridge/Arlington from Kendall Square last night. I'm glad my coat had a hood. Life could be worse. I could be homeless or jobless. But I am pretty poor. And I was wondering who would like to take responsibility for my $60. I cannot afford to buy another pass. You guys charged me and didn't deliver the pass. Isn't that illegal? And if it isn't illegal, isn't that wrong? This will probably get tossed into a bin of 1,000. But I figured I'd write, because I just had to say something. This.. is really unacceptable. ----------I tried to file that under refunds, because I realized how many daytime minutes I wasted talking to the credit card company last night.  What can I say? I'm in between paychecks and poor. The MBTA has yet to respond.UPDATE: 4/4/08 Credit card company returned the money to my account. Still no word from the MBTA through phone or e-mail. I'm kind of glad I didn't have to go to an office to argue. I don't know if I could really fight to have a pass to this underground place where I'm groped, stepped on, pushed, forced to wait, and hit in the stomach with a backpack. I mean shouldn't I get paid?"
161,2 star rating,"Oct 13, 2006","I could probably write a book  filled with all my rantings and ravings about the T.  I don't want to seem ungrateful, I'm glad we at least have some semblance of a public transportation system, but, at the same time, I get more and more frustrated every time I step onto a bus. A lot of my complaints arise from two bus lines- the 1 and the Silver Line.   I don't have actual stats, but I wouldn't be surprised to learn that those two lines are the most used in the system.  There are a lot of freakin' people on those damn buses.  And, unfortunately for me, most of them are complete fucking idiots.  Some simple rules everyone should follow to make commuting on the T a better experience: 1. Move your ass to the window seat.  Do NOT make people ask to sit down.  When you sit on the aisle, legs spread out like you own the world, you are effectively taking up two seats.  People that do that should be fined and/or banned from the T.  The only time it is acceptable is when there is some really gross wet spot and/or food leftovers in the window seat.  This is especially unacceptable during rush hour when the bus is packed and your fat fucking ass can't be bothered to move.  You are not entitled to two seats, sorry. 2. Strollers.  They are a safety hazard.   It's not my fault you have a three year old to tote around or that you feel the need to cart it around in a gigantic SUV sized stroller.  They shouldn't be allowed on the bus.  And, I should not be expected to CLIMB OVER THE SEATS because you've blocked the entire aisle and your attempt to ""help"" is by pulling the stroller closer to you, leaving an aisle of, oh, four inches.  Not even Kate Bosworth's skinny ass can get through that. 3. Bus drivers, if your bus is full, don't try to pack more people on.  In addition to wanting to get on a bus, many of your passengers want to get OFF the bus when their stop has finally come.  Climbing over people and being pushed around is never an acceptable predicament on the bus.  (I've actually been late to work because I'll wait for the next bus when I see idiot drivers like this--- and yes, the next bus is completely empty).  And, on top of being crushed in like a sardine, we all end up being late.   4. Hey T- how nice of you to inform me to ""expect delays due to heavy traffic in the downtown area""- but by now you should realize that there is ""heavy traffic in the downtown area"" EVERYDAY between 4:30 and 6:00 p.m. and plan accordingly.  When there are 75 people waiting at the silver line stop at Temple then you've officially fucked up. 5. Teenage girls: why can't you sit with your friends?  Why do you have to take up the entire back 12 seats of the bus when there are six of you?  Other people would like to sit in those seats, but we can't because you'll scream and giggle in our ears.   6. Greenline conductors- open all the doors.  Seriously- making people climb all the way from the back, then letting the stream of people on the bus is a twenty minute process.  Do you really care about the T's profit margin?  No, I didn't think so.  There is absolutely no reason for this safety hazard.  It's dangerous!  One entrance and exit on a train?  It's fucking ludicrous!  And, if I ever hear another fucking conductor get on the PA system and yell ""Move towards the back, there's room in the back""  I might actually go postal.  They can't see if there's room in the back.  There isn't room in the back, you idiot.  We all do a pretty good  job of moving to the back even though we know that your one-door-opening ass is going to make it a pain to get out again. 7.  In general- shut the fuck up- don't yell, scream, talk loudly, or bring a screaming child on the bus.  Noise pollution is highly underrated in this city- a little peace and quiet goes a long way.  It's no wonder people try to drown it out with their own iPod noise (which doesn't bother me, hey, if you want to go deaf at 40 that's your prerogative) 8.  The T needs to ban food.  Seriously.  It's disgusting.  I don't want to smell it, see it, or hear someone eat it.  DC bans it- and their subways are surprisingly clean.  This is especially annoying on the overcrowded Silver Line where your trip isn't going to last that long- you can wait till you arrive at your destination instead of risking getting ketchup on the poor schmuck sitting next to you. Things that don't bother me about the T: I don't need it to run all night or until two in the morning, but I'm old and cranky; the orange and red lines are pretty decent; compared to the rest of the world, the T is still cheap- NY, DC, Paris, London, even Denver- all more expensive;  Okay- end rant."

THE BOSTON MBTA is an outdated and unsafe MONSTROSITY driven by a corrupt state that has it sunk so deep in debt that can't even pay the banks interest.  The Red Line breaks down hourly - and its overcrowded and outdated cars leave commuters freezing on un-sheltered platforms in the winter.  There are never any police to be found underground on the train or platform.. the Transit Police are all out sitting in a cruiser on the street - far away from the violence underground.The tunnels between Alewife and Harvard are collapsing during the rainy season and the whole system is in need of a major change due to the fact that modern cars cannot be placed on the old tracks which are too small.  The state and federal government does nothing about it.Try riding the so called ""Silver Line"" through the Ted Williams tunnel and tell me if you don't have back pain from the experience.

While it's not as extensive as say New Yorks subway and bus system, its four (arguably five) lines beat the BART in usefulness hands down.Really though? The silver line is a joke and an insult to the 'hoods who rely on this bus (we all know its a bus) for getting around. With a grace period of seven minutes things are relatively on time.

Today's commute is another poor example of the subpar service Keolis/MBTA provides on the Worcester/Framingham line. We were trapped on a train that came to a complete stop at Wellesley Hills, due to mechanical trouble. One conductor provided the option to jump on a train heading back to Worcester. Why would I want to go back to a stop I just left?Twenty minutes later we were told that only 55 people had the option to get on a bus that was coming to shuttle passengers to Back Bay and South Station. What about the other passengers that did not make the cattle call to get on the shuttle bus?  Someone could argue that we were kidnapped by Keolis/MBTA today, as we were being held against our will on a train with no lights or central air. Today is another example of what always begs the question: What warrants the next fare increase? Guess what, it was announced that we can expect another one very soon. Conductors do not announce stops, trains are dirty, windows are fogged making it difficult to see outside windows and today we were trapped on a train. When does the torture end? When will a better company save us from such poor service? Keolis, you have failed."

Looking back it seems crazy but back then I didn't even know how to read the maps. Hey, I grew up in the 'burbs and had a car the day I got my license. I lovingly opened my arms and accepted you wholeheartedly but we've had a very tumultuous year. And now we've settled into a love/hate relationship.I love that you are always there for me and you help me get from A to B. I love the updated Charlie card system even though some kinks are still being worked out. And I love... well...ummm... moving on...I hate hate HATE that you're always delayed, you stop running WAY before the bars close, you attract cray crays,small crying children, tourists, and drunken sports fans. I hate that the cars are so small that not only am I forced to ride with theses people but that they're all up in my personal space bubble because there isn't enough room. I hate that you have no temperature control. And I hate that you're staff is rude more often than not.I hope we can work through our problems and have a more peaceful relationship in the future.xoxo"

I called it the Boston Masticare - a bad pun off the Italian transitive verb ""to chew.""  Our journey begins with the Boston public transit (""MBTA""), which is a combination of trollies and underground subways.  Of the the 5 subway lines, the Green Line is the most confusing with letters that split off at certain points.  You think you're on the right train that's heading in the right direction, but you later realize that you end up going off the wrong path.  Given time, you learn to adapt.  The fixed fare ($1.70 CharlieCard, $2.00 Cash) is nice so you never worry about being short changed.  The trains are clean but I can't say the same about the train stations.  When compared to DC's Metro system, I still prefer the more familiar DC Metro.  Call it hometown bias.  Call it simplicity.  But then again, the worst public transit is always the one that you're waiting for.[Original Visit: Feb. 14, 2009, 10:33 AM]"

It looks, feels and smells like a dump, its over-crowded on the redline and an inordinate number of the transit cops come across to me as the most bored-out-of-thier-minds, poorly trained unprofessional bunch of LEOs this side of New Orleans.The drivers for both the bus and the T are the saving grace...sure you get your occasional surly lipped bastid...but most of the time they are decent people with a sense of humor which surprises me when I see some of the crap they put up with!  I love my T, but that's why I expect more from it, cuz I know what it can and should be!!"

176,1 star rating,"Feb 14, 2013","One of the worst public transportation systems ever. Rude, incompetent staff (possibly racist--bus drivers have refused to pick me up). They keep on increasing the price while reducing service. Also, why does the system shut down at 1 am??? how do you expect people to get to the airport for an early morning flight? Horrible, horrible! For a city that claims to be cosmopolitan and efficient the mbta is a real shame.Also, just the other day, a 1 bus driver and a homeless man fought for nearly twenty minutes on Mass Ave. He refused to get off (because it's cold and snowing outside) and so she refused to drive. Eventually the police came and dragged the man away. I know this happens in a lot of cities, but Boston treats its customers like cattle--the dehumanizing experience and the stupidity of the whole system is a real nightmare."
177,1 star rating,"Jul 21, 2008","Literally, an international joke. We've all heard the stories of how things are run and we've all experienced the incompetence and hostility firsthand. The MBTA is barely competent, corrupt and idiotic. They're also on the verge of bankruptcy and things are only getting worse. A friend of mine who worked here told me firsthand that all anyone (including him) did was push pencils around, ignore the work to be done and drink on the MBTA's dollar. He confirmed that the stories about deceased people being on the payroll are absolutely true. I know running mass transit is an enormously difficult, surgical task. So I sympathize with them, to a point. And it is a functional system - I get to work every day, not always on time. Not all of the problems the system has are because of mismanagement. But most of them are!"

179,1 star rating,"Mar 23, 2013","Oh how I hate you MBTA. What a shitty transit system you are. Perhaps the worst I've had the displeasure of experiencing. I've tried Chicago, DC, NYC and you fall furthest from acceptable public service. Where to start? Almost every week there's some delay on the Red Line. I've come to accept that just because I have to be at work in the morning at a certain time doesn't mean we're on the same schedule, I've adjusted for it. There's also those stupid turnstiles which half the time don't work or register my card incorrectly. And when they do work properly there's always 1 or 2 slackers that runs up behind me to forgo paying their fare. Actually there was one time when your turn style at Park Street was broken and I went right on through, since I had a monthly pass anyways. I was stopped by an undercover cop for that. At least I think she was a cop . She was dressed in plain clothes but flashed me her gun and not her badge. I assume she was a cop since she didn't rob me after asking to see my Charlie Card. That was scary but it wasn't my fault your crappy turn styles break often.Was that the last time this train system saw any improvements or an upgrade? I'm sure you've noticed the ever increasing load of passengers during rush hours. Whatever happened to adding that other line? I mean clearly that Green line expansion is a long time coming. Is it going the way of another Big Dig project to never see completion?In the mean time perhaps trying to fix the current tracks you've already got in place? I swear that the green line alone counts for a good deal of hearing loss. From North Station to Hynes you would think that the high pitched screeching sounds are not the best on the ears. Kudos on fixing the steps in Boylston Street station. You know that was one of a few lawsuits waiting to happen."

The MBTA though is fine for what it is.  Basic public transportation.I frequent the Blue Line and the Commuter Rail system from Lynn-North Station.  Very rarely do I have any issues with the T.People will complain a lot, but few people realize that the MBTA is one of the cheapest public transportation systems in the United States.  It is far more expensive in Los Angeles, Washington DC, New York.  There are some issues that the MBTA needs to address.  In a city the size of Boston with a large metro area......they need to find a way to run past midnight on the weekends.  Many people that go into Boston to the bars, drive in because they know they'll be stranded if they stay past the 11 o'clock train at North Station or the midnight subway train.  In an effort to curb drunk driving and present better service the MBTA union should find an acceptable middle ground for 24-hour service.  Without a full-time public transportation system, Boston will always be a step behind other major cities in the world that are more available to visitors and residents of the area."

One time the guy at Harvard Ave. in the truck even tried to get me to pay again to get on the next train after the previous one went express.Hahahahaha. No, sorry, it's not just that we live here.

187,1 star rating,"Aug 22, 2012","I can not possibly FATHOM how someone could give the MBTA 5 stars.....they must be referring to another MBTA somewhere...This is not the MBTA I know of dating back to the good ole token days....1) a few nights ago the 11:26 pm B train (3606A) going outbound from pleasant street doesn't stop for me while I'm at the rear car area of the platform. The driver looks directly at me as he drives by. I take this train nightly from work so I know it's another 25 minutes until the next train and it's raining slightly. Being that I work in a gym: I run past the train and get on at Packard's Corner.The driver says to me I wasn't on the platform, so just get on the train and stop complaining. I asked how he knew I wasn't on the platform if he knew where I ran from? He then refused to give me his driver I.D. number. This is absolutely ridiculous, and this crap happens almost daily.2)This morning the train is 20 minutes late, and when we get to Packard's Corner it apparently is going express: but the driver DOES NOT make an announcement. The other passengers are left to ""telephone line"" it to the back of the train. The driver then starts getting pissy and I confront him asking how he thought this was the riders' fault and not one of the MBTA? Then he closes the door on my face.3)I have COUNTLESS memories of: doors closing on my face while I'm on the platform, trains going express w/o announcements, trains/ busses being severely late. I remember for instance the last snowstorm we had. I was on the 57 coming around the Union Square corner in Allston. The bus has maybe 5 people on it, in a very heavy snowstorm. The bus did not stop from St. Elizabeth's Until Harvard Ave @ Brighton. I saw ~20 people in total standing outside including elderly, people with strollers, students with backpacks. This is not an isolated case.I've voiced several complaints and have never received much at all aside from ""there are delays.""5 stars? Who paid that reviewer? Ask any one in Boston about a review for the MBTA. I would gladly bump it up to 2 stars if the MBTA hadn't simultaneously cut services while hiking the fare.MBTA= Mostly Bad Transportation Assistance*p.s. this was posted on another MBTA page...I do not understand why there are so many MBTA pages...*"
188,2 star rating,"May 28, 2007","I bitch a lot about the New York subway, but after spending some time in Boston I realize we actually have it pretty easy in the Big Apple. First, the price of the Boston subway is outrageous. It recently jumped from $1.25, which was reasonable, to $2, which is a total ripoff. For your information, a subway ride in NYC is also $2, but there are over 20 subway lines and you get two rides for free when you buy 10. In Boston where there are about 5 lines $2 seems hardly justified.Second, the subway doesn't run at night... this may seem like a small point, but it pretty much means you have to pay for a cab ride if you want to stay out after 12am... ridiculous and incredibly annoying.Third, it really isn't very reliable. I have been stuck between stations for 30 minutes before, and I am not exaggerating. ""We are momentarily being held by traffic ahead of us""... this works for a few minutes, but after half an hour without any serious explanation or even an estimate of how long we're being delayed I start getting the urge to smash people's heads with a baseball bat, and I am the most laid-back and cool-headed guy you'll ever meet. Seriously, it would be faster to walk! What saves it is the relative cleanliness of the stations, although the trains at the end of the day are so littered you have to watch your step... Is it really too difficult to pick up your trash when you go?"
189,3 star rating,"Jun 23, 2006","Complain all you want, the T is better public transportation than is available to most people in the United States.  It needs improvement -- maintenance is long deferred, communication suffers from a clear lack of guiding leadership philosophy on the subject (namely that it's important), and the system suffers from design flaws owing to the unavoidable realities of its history.  But let's not go around whining too much.  Go try living in the suburbs without a car sometime and tell me how bad dealing with the T is by comparison. The T's biggest problems stem from how the state funds it.  Right now the T carries the highest debt load of any transit agency in the country, a result of fiscal restructuring imposed upon it in 2000 by the legislature.  It cannot expand any more, it cannot run later hours, it cannot avoid fare increases, and it ultimately cannot continue to operate if this condition doesn't change. So it's in your hands.  If you think the T sucks, well, it's because you're not going to your legislator to tell him/her to end the debt burden and allow the T breathing room.  You have to remember, a lousy T means politicians always have a cause to champion for you -- they're never going to change anything unless you pressure them to.  I know, I know, first they want you to vote, and now you have to actually do something.  Being an adult in a democracy's a bitch, ain't it?    Bottom line = The T is pretty good, should be much better, and is going to get much worse soon unless you do something about it."
190,2 star rating,"Nov 23, 2012","Dear MBTA, Like many other reviewers have already stated, the MBTA is clean, affordable, has the ever so famous Charlie Card, and runs to many major stops within the city and its suburbs...good job. You've been awarded two stars.But what makes this transportation system stuck in the stone age is the huge annoyance of the trains shutting down at midnight, especially on weekends before bars close. I haven't read up on why this is still in effect (as I'm sure it has been hotly debated), but it seems absolutely nonsensical to everyone who lives outside of Boston. Bars close at 2; subways close at midnight. It isn't rocket science. Not having the commuter rail at night means more drunk driving. Most of us do not feel like paying the creepy chain-smoking cabbies $100 to drive us home, especially when there's a commuter rail stop within our town. And we wonder why there are so many accidents on i93...So do us all a favor MBTA and my beloved city, and end the frustrating arguments between my friends and I about who will be the DD, if it's worth it to drive into Boston, if we should go to that crappy townie bar or not, and if men have the ability to develop breast milk.

191,1 star rating,"Feb 6, 2019","I wish I could give ZERO stars. The MBTA is a disgrace to the state of Massachusetts. I have been logging complaints about ONE bus driver since September 2018, who blatantly disrespects us CUSTOMERS, by showing up late to the bus stop (after the posted departure time on every posted schedule possible) and then parks the bus to take a 10-15 minute bathroom break. My son who relies on this said bus, is Tardy to school EVERY single day, but whoooooooooo cares, right? You want these children to be positive, active, SUCCESSFUL members of the community, yet you show them that people can waste their time and function on their own accord, without any regard to others? If my son skips school because his bus has him waiting in the cold, he's a bad kid, right? Never mind that he shows up EARLY to be responsible and HE is the child. The MBTA operates because WE pay for it! That bus driver has a job, because of US... but he gets to not do his job properly and still receive a paycheck? But mine should be compromised because you have poor disciplinary policies and I am showing up to work late? My son gets punished for showing up to school late, but a grown man gets to walk around like he is invincible? Oh, but the solution is WE should find another route? Why should we be inconvenienced instead of your company DOING IT'S JOB! I will forever not recommend ANY single human being to takethe MBTA, or offer support.

197,4 star rating,"May 12, 2012","I came to this review from an article on BostonInnovation on Facebook about the T's bad reviews.It's true that our MBTA isn't as brand new as the DC Metro (for which I sometimes feel I'm underdressed, it's so nice) but there are a lot of tools to help you with the T.  If you live in Boston, you shouldn't take the T like a tourist.As to scheduling on the buses, there are apps for your iPhone or Droid called ""NextBus"" which is a geo-location app notifying you about the arrival of the next transport with up to the minute data.  Also, the Silver Line has been pretty reliable, and I sometimes take the Number 9 bus to Southie and no problems.I should add as a caveat that I am not a daily user.  Probably 15x a month.  I could see how frustrations would grow.  But remember, do not compare the T to private transport.  It is public, and as such, you do have to be with the public.  There's nothing the T can do about  Boston's public...unfortunately."
198,2 star rating,"Mar 12, 2012","My two star rating has nothing to do with the proposed service cuts or fare hikes. If you look at other transit systems across the country, they are looking at the same problems.My rating is based on the services, or lack of them, especially, the train service, here in Central MA.First, there is no service available to the western part of the state and the service east towards Boston is nothing to be proud of.Having grown up essentially in the central part of Long Island, I am used to much better, 24 hour service, something the MBTA will probably never deliver."
199,4 star rating,"Jan 7, 2016","First of all, people need to realize that the MBTA was the First Subway in America! Thats right folks. Therefore a lot of the infrastructure today is still based off of the old trolley lines (green line). Each line really deserves its own rating as they all have their quirks and downsides.Green Line: ""The first and the worst."" The part from Park Street to Boylston was the first subway in the entire country!  The trains come very often but its always crowded and very slow. In fact it is now the most crowded Light Rail system in the entire world! The stations are confusing and the trains stop like every 50 feet to wait for a signal to change.I love taking visitors on it is and watching their confusion as it makes awful screeching noises as it winds around very tight turns underground! :)Red Line: ""The Powerhouse of the MBTA"". This line is the mitochondria of the MBTA. Its fairly clean and efficient and comes pretty often. Yes, there are occasional signal problems but its more reliable than the other lines. This is because it is one of the ""newer"" lines built by the mbta (still pretty old though) and was designed as a subway system to begin with, not a trolley system.Orange Line: ""The great depression--a ride-along journey"". This line is pretty sketch. In fact the most sketchy of all the lines. Trains are very very old and do not come very often (every 15 minutes). Trains are crowded, stations smell terrible. I am a guy and would also not want to travel on this line at night alone. Also there's the fact that there were like 3 fires on it one year that makes me hesitant to take it :)Blue Line: ""Who even takes this?"" Its empty, clean and efficient. The tunnel on the harbor to the airport was dug by hand back in the 1900's or something. Its impressive.  Also the airport station is not at the airport--you must take a bus to the airport."
200,3 star rating,"Aug 27, 2008","You guys are so spoiled. Come to Philly and take SEPTA, then you'll know what bad public transit really is. My dad always complains that the MBTA, ""is so dirty and slow and there are homeless people all over the place, blah blah blah..."" In Philly, he had to take the orange line to my graduation and I swear to god it practically TRAUMATIZED him. He still talks about the horrible experience and asks if it has improved at all and if  we still use tokens (no and yes).You could eat off the floor of a Boston trolley compared to what we have here. Still, I give the MBTA three stars because I remember what it was like to leave work and cram into a hot D line trolley filled with smelly Sox fans who totally could have gotten off at Kenmore but don't feel like walking the extra couple blocks because they're too fat and lazy and oh my god their kids are so annoying, ect. Also, what's with the new trolleys that have like a mile of empty space in the middle with nothing to hold on to? I really hope they have gotten rid of those. There is room for improvement, no doubt, but this is not the worst of the worst."

Some conductors are nice other are ok and others just seem like they are up for a fight. The people who make announcement sound straight out of the ghetto. I mean cmon people like cant you even make a decent announcement about taking the cell phones out?Wifi is terrible, trains are slow, saggy seats, almost 11$ a ticket one way, poor staff and customer service, trains have issues every other day, from being late to electric, to engine power issues. I have waited on few stops almost good 20 min. cuz the engine gave up.I think it is time to for some competition to come up because MBTA is totally ripping off american people!"
202,5 star rating,"Nov 14, 2011","We bought the 7 day pass on our trip to Boston. A one way costs $2, 1 day is $9, and 7 days is $15. We figured that the best value would be to buy the 7 day pass even though we were only going to use the train for 2 days. You can buy the train passes at all the subway stops. Let me tell you.... it was the best decision ever! Boston is small and everything is close. When I say close, I mean, within 2-3 stops from each other. If you've taken the Chicago CTA or the transit system in NY, Boston's train system is a walk in the park! Signs were posted and we didn't get lost at all. If we come back to Boston in the future, we will be taking the train everywhere. The only downside is that they stop running at 12:30am. Other than that, I think it's the best way to get around Boston on a budget. It's quick and cheap. Can't beat it."
203,3 star rating,"Feb 26, 2019","While I very much appreciate public transit, and that we have the T, twice this past month the driver of the 59 bus drove right by me as I waved like an frantic idiot to get him to pick me up at the bus stop. Bus drivers need to pay attention to potential riders as they pass a stop (especially in subzero temperatures) and MBTA could install some lighting at their stops to make passengers easier to see when it is dark. Several others have told me this happened to them as well."
204,4 star rating,"Nov 13, 2009","During my stay in Boston, I split my time walking, taking the T and cabbing it. I walked whenever I could which caused me to be tired and try the T. And when that wasn't running, I cabbed it. Of the three options, I liked the T best.It was cheap.It was fast.It was entertaining. Walking to a stop always felt like an adventure. Would the machine today be finicky? Take debit but not credit card? Take credit card but not debit? How about cash? Oh, not this machine. It was a death match between me and the machines. Sometimes they were wily but I was more clever. No debit card? Fine. Let's try the credit card. Oh ho! You don't want to take that either? I got cash! I've outsmarted you, you awful machine!Other than that, the system was pretty self-explanatory. The rides are $2 a ride. If you got on the wrong one (i.e. inbound instead of outbound), you could always ask someone where the next next stop was so you can switch over. I took mostly the red line which I found smooth. The green was slower and curved a lot. I felt imminent sickness coming about. But once I took the orange all the way out to go visit the Sam Adams Brewery. Lastly, we took the silver line to the airport. Apparently this was a bus instead of the subway. Okiedoke.All rides were uneventful except during rush hour. The conductor was yelling at people the whole time not to lean on the doors and not to hold them. I would think people wouldn't want to fall out or lose limbs. Hm.I think next time I'd buy a week long pass though. I managed to spend about $22 for the T for just a few short days. Then again, it is cheaper than cabbing it."

208,1 star rating,"May 12, 2012",review for the websiteIf I could give it a 0 right now I would!The commuter rail schedule is extremely misleading.  When you go on the schedule website for Saturday and Sunday from Middleboro it still has the times.  My 69 year old mother was waiting for the 8:22 train (along with 8 other people who obviously did not know there was no train service on the weekends). Even when you go on that site it says NO SERVICE UPDATES AT THIS TIME.  I beg to differ this is a website to show the schedule and clearly there is a schedule change!  Unless you click on the Middleboro hyperlink and THEN click on another link for advisories you would not know there was suspended service.  I am irate at how misleading this website is!!  How hard is it to take the times off the schedule since they obviously mean nothing!!!!

No one answering the phone.Forgot about people looking for simple validation with questions not answeredby looking at schedules that are incomplete  information. i.e. how long ittakes to get from that destination to another?  Bad computer software that shouldallow you to estimate arrival by putting in starting and ending destinations. Director needs to retire after that rant about storms. All she had to say we are doing ourbest with the unusual and nasty weather patterns, period.   People understand, and if you are stuck, you're stuck. period.  We cannot control the weather folks.

210,2 star rating,"Sep 4, 2007","I loathe public transportation but I can't live without it.  I have witnessed the growing pains of The T for years from the age of 5, crawling under the turnstile since my fare was free, to this past weekend where I had the pleasure of riding for an hour from the orange line to Harvard square for the grossly-inflated fare of $1.70.  I don't think much has changed nor has service improved but prices have certainly risen.  I yearn for those years in the not-too-distant past that it was $0.85 per ride.I think that all the lines with the exception of the above-ground green line trains are fairly dependable (you miss one then you know it's abut a 15 minute wait).  Last train is a little after midnight so it's not an option if you plan on a late night.The system is fairly straightforward for it's easy to navigate as a visitor or a new transplant.  I would avoid hopping on the T as much as possible - for many locales, it's faster to walk than take the T. My biggest criticism besides the standard uncleanliness and undependability (where you're stuck on a stalled car for what feels like an eternity) that you would expect from any public transportation system no matter how great it is, is that the hours and frequency of the trains is subpar.  Unfortunately, it's a chicken or the egg situation.  The volume of ridership won't increase without such improvements and without increased ridership,  the MBTA lacks the funds to increase train capacity and frequency.  Whenever I return to Boston, I find myself pondering whether I should drive in or take the T.  Then I think back to those times I was stuck on Comm Ave on winter nights, icicles forming on my eyelashes waiting for an inbound train that wouldn't show up for 25 minutes.  Or those times I was stuck in unventilated Park Street station unable to get on a train because they were all full....each and every one, one after the next.  Or those times in high school after finishing up extra-curricular activities and waiting for the bus in the evening, only for the bus to drive right past me and my friends as if we weren't all congregated under the bus stop sign and waving our hands feverishly for it to stop.  9 times out of 10 I just drive because it just isn't worth the risk of getting screwed by the MBTA."
211,3 star rating,"Apr 8, 2006","At the time of writing I live closest to Kenmore station. Heading downtown I can catch a B, C or D line FAST and during commute hours, I usually don't have to wait more than 2 minutes to hop on a subway car. There is a caveat to the increased number of trains running durring rush hour, though, and that is that the cars stop often inbetween stations - I guess their tunnels get ""rush hour traffic"" too, so more trains but long ride times from destination to destination. There needs to be a way to stay on a subway car and go from the Back Bay area across to Cambridge without switching to a bus. It takes me an HOUR to get from Kenmore to Alewife during rush hour, and I can easily ride my bike 5 miles almost as the crow flies in less time. Going all the way downtown to the Park Street stop to get on the Red Line outbound to Cambridge is really obnoxious. It's like travelling in the shape of a horseshoe to get from Back Bay to west Cambridge. Probably a crossing subway at the Mass Ave bridge could work. It's cheaper than having a car but at times it's simply less of a hassle to ride a bike somewhere instead of taking the subway.. Some of the stations are clean and gorgeous. Others are dirty beyond belief. Ruggles? Roxbury Crossing? Blue line? Kenmore...yuck. Spend enough time in Park Street and you'll end up smelling like exhaust. Gross."

Well, try living in a giant city that completely lacks public transportation of any substance.  That means constant driving, financial overhead of car care, caring about gas price fluctuation, flat tires, and bum nights when you draw short straw and end up the designated driver. . . again.  Public transportation means that you and all your friends get to drink every time.  No one ever has to be sober and ruin the night with their sober-talk.MBTA: gettin' Brosef, Mr. Brojangles, and the rest of Broston drunk since 1897."
213,1 star rating,"Dec 21, 2007","I'm a BIG fan of public transportation, I love it and I think it is necessary for communities. I depend upon it. However, the T is TERRIBLE and has only gotten worse over the decades. It used to be 85 cents for the longest time, can you believe that!?? In a time when Toronto and NYC were $2.50 a ride, our tokens were under a buck. But now, with the Charlie Card, THE CHARLIE CARD, it's draconian and insane. The T is blatantly fucking over tourists. WHY are there 2 different tickets and prices for the T? And why is it so mysterious to obtain a rechargeable card versus the ticket? Why aren't the prices listed on the ticket machine and broken into fares or rides?? Why aren't there transfers?? I accidently went the wrong way from downtown xing and realized it at chinatown and had to buy another ticket just to get to the other platform. Not right!It's not frequent, you wait for ever. The schedule messages aren't even right, don't trust them. Stops running long before the bars close (drunk driving anyone??) and the cars are usually filthy.I wish I could give them negative stars."
214,1 star rating,"Jan 29, 2015",During rush hours... trains are over crowded and late. 5-10 mins wait for train causes too many people waiting at the platform thus causing too much crowd and have to fight to get in the train.  MBTA sucks big time. they need to upgrade and have more frequent trains(every 2-3 mins) to avoid crowd. Green Line is the biggest joke... you can probably walk and get to places fast enough than riding Green Line.

Due in part to the near-constant state of disrepair, the countless delays, the notorious ""switching problems"" and general unexplained unreliability, this ridiculous operation has, on MULTIPLE occasions, reduced me to tears, cost me large sums of money, made me late for work, and actually caused PHYSICAL HARM to my BODY requiring physical therapy - and I'm still not totally okay. They're appallingly incompetent, and if ANY other company had such disregard and utter CONTEMPT for their customers, they would be kaput in no time. Rather than ranting, I'll offer a SMALL SAMPLE of the MBTA Failures & Incompetence Log I maintained on my iPhone spanning only THREE WEEKS.11/27/07 Clear, dark, 43THREE or more runs of 70/70A were skipped. Bus (70) arrived @ 6:38pm. Waited about 50 minutes. Called MBTA.11/28/07 Clear, dark, 30Bus scheduled to arrive @ 5:58 didn't appear. Last inbound bus seen @ approximately 5:30pm. 70A arrived @ 6:09pm. Waited exactly 16 minutes. Did not call MBTA. CentralSquare schedule for 47 bus lists departure @ 6:40pm, contradicting MBTA.com which lists the time as 6:35pm. Posted schedule alludes to alternate weekday scheduling from late September through June. Bus 'compromised' by departing @ 6:37pm. 11/29/07 9:20AM 40OBSERVED 70A arrival @ 311 Arsenal. TWO 70A buses arrived simultaneously. 11/29/07 11:51AM 42OBSERVED 70A stopping about 100+ feet before bus stop. Riders exited. Bus continued down Arsenal Street, failing to stop for rider waiting at designated bus stop. Rider unsuccessfully attempted to gain driver's attention by flailing arms wildly & shouting while chasing bus. Rider was forced to return to bus stop to wait for next bus. 11/29/07 5:50PM clear, dark, 40 70 bus arrived before scheduled time stated on mbta.com - 5:58pm 11/29/07 6:08pm 40OBSERVED 70 bus traveling in opposite direction -2nd since my arrival at bus stop just before 6pm. Still no sign of next due inbound bus. 11/29/07 6:14pm 39 70A arrived. Driver was friendly and welcoming. CONCLUSION: The 70 bus arrived a full 8 minutes early, while the 70A was late by that exact amount. This bloated the wait time between buses to 300% its usual length - stretched the wait from 8 minutes to 24 minutes! 12/18/07 6:20 - 6:54 pm  28 Waited @ Harvard Station for the 77. When I arrived, about 25 people were already waiting. As our wait time increased, the waiting crowd grew. Called MBTA & was given an excuse of ""holiday traffic congestion"". This is ABSURD considering the 77 runs straight up & down Mass Ave, & I already had seen the surface roads in much more highly-congested areas such as Memorial Drive & Harvard Square, where no abnormal traffic was observed. MBTA representative hung up on me. When 77 finally arrived (after at LEAST 35 minutes), two were sent at once to accommodate more than 100 waiting passengers. Still, both buses were standing-room-only. 12/19/07  9:48am 31 Arlington Center, inbound, Mass Ave@Jason St. Stood directly atop snowbank (as no path was cleared in waist-high snowpiles to allow access from sidewalk to road). Was CLEARLY visible standing closer than one foot to the bus stop sign, however, 79 bus failed to stop to allow me to board. Hence, I continued FREEZING for the next 16 minutes while waiting for another bus to arrive. 12/19/07 6:25-6:52pm 33 Have now been waiting for the 77 bus for 27 minutes @ Harvard Station. Schedule lists the 77 route as leaving Harvard Station every 10 minutes or less at this time of day."

220,3 star rating,"Mar 25, 2012","The MBTA has good public transportation, considering the size of the metropolitan area. It's user-friendly, compared to say, Santa Fe Trails (that has limited hours&didn't have a ticket kiosk back in the '90s) or the Napa Valley Vine (that looks messy, but it does its job) The MBTA is excellent if one doesn't have a car. One can go to various museums (the Institute of Contemporary Art is way off the beaten path), take it across the Charles River to Cambridge, see the sights of Super 88, the Boston University Campus, Beacon Hill, the Mother Church of Christian Science.Public transportation tends to be superior on the East Coast than on the West Coast (or the Southwest) The conductors are friendly, one gets helpful announcements, there are maps, the train cars are clean. Riding the T, one can see how Boston is the Athens of the West because they are oft filled with students taking notes&reading their textbooks. The MBTA goes above&beyond."

Everyday I see the workers just hanging around and doing nothing, except talking to their buddies.  Now that we got the automatic card/ticket, why do we need these people?  It's not like they're there to sell tokens.  You'd think they're there to aid anyone who's having trouble buying tickets or are there for security reasons, but I don't think so.  OK, they do help people, but they yell at them!  I've witnessed a few of those things too many times.  I don't want people to be jobless, but why don't you just get rid of these people and stop hiking up the fares from the money you saved?  Or at least people should do their jobs.And why do you need to employ (PAY) guys to individually hand out the Charlie Tickets?  A monkey can hand out the tickets and it'll be more entertaining.

233,2 star rating,"Nov 16, 2017","The heat is always blasting, whether it's freezing outside or 80 degrees in the summer. On the Providence Line outbound, conductors don't announce the stops. Some conductors are rude while others value their jobs and are worth every cent they're paid. Sadly, good conductors are few and far between. There's a blonde lady who's a real sweetheart and she's usually taking tickets on the 5:50pm train. Sure the prices are astronomical, but she has a great personality so forking over my hard earned money is slightly less painful when she's in the cart. The wifi is advertised but it barely ever works. Train was an hour late last month because it was raining the night before. If Boston parking wasn't so expensive, I'd probably just drive to work every day. The Canton Junction station is not protected very well from the elements, so it's always important to wait as long as possible to walk from the parking lot to the station's track maze 11/12 of the year. Some of the train carts are new-ish but others are in their 30s like me, the seats are ripped and very saggy. I'm not fat but I feel claustrophobic in these seats. Between parking and train fare it's about $4 cheaper per day using the train as opposed to driving into the city. I've noticed the outbound trains are late more frequently than the inbound ones -- but they're all too late in general. Whether it's 10 minutes or 60, it's not good. People's jobs are dependent on them showing up on time, or at least the scheduled hour of when companies open. The MBTA is the #1 reason I'll never get rid of my vehicle. Why do the prices keep rising?! Neither service nor quality have risen in decades- and they're always cutting stops or widening the time between trains."

I've been to many other subway cities, but Boston really does well in terms of weather, operations, time, cleanliness and combined service (bus-rail).  Easy to ride to/from the AIrport, and after moving here, I sold both of my Subaru's and bought a Charlie card....I haven't looked back."
235,2 star rating,"Mar 26, 2009","Ugh. After four years in Boston, including a summer and a semester of taking the Green Line 6 miles downtown and back each day (putting me at nearly two hours of T-riding a day), I can conclude that the T is something I will miss the least.  Having grown up in Washington with the speedy and clean Metro, nothing can really compare.  Still, the T doesn't even come close.  Boston College has the unfortunate position of not only being at end of the Green Line, but situated at the end of the B branch of the Green Line, the bane of the MBTA existence.  Anyone who lives along the B Line route knows exactly what I'm talking about, but for those of you who don't, suffice it to say that the B line literally stops every 25 feet, and is subject to the same traffic lights etc. as other cars, culminating in an hour and fifteen minute commute if you're like me and have to take it the entire way.   The first thing freshman at BC learn is to take advantage of the fact that the C & D lines are a short shuttle ride away on the BC Bus and will get you there so much faster.  Of course, this doesn't even take into account the fact that the T could do one of any number of things once you are already on it:- Break down.- Break down again.- Restart, break down a third time, and require an emergency rescue from another T as you watch the minutes tick by and frantically type an email to your boss about how it looks like you might be late to work, again.- Decide en route to become ""express"" to a certain location, and skip all other stops along that route.  Don't worry though, there is a train immediately behind you making all ""local"" stops.  (What is this, the commuter rail?).  ** Side note: this is actually awesome if you are A) already on the T and B) not among the group of people whose stop was skipped.- This, again, is specific to the Green Line, but don't forget the bottleneck effect at Kenmore where are the lines merge into the underground system.So why two stars and not one?  It looks like the T has been trying to make a comeback in recent years, with new stations in some places and the CharlieCard system.  Though the T has a long way to go to reach the efficiency of DC's Metro, I give it props for trying. And after all, what else is there?"
236,2 star rating,"Jun 18, 2013","Transportation? To me it seems that cattle have sometimes better transportation than this so called ""T"". I think how I dont have to mention anyone who experienced the green line how bad it is. Yes, it is the oldest subway in the US, but it seems that MBTA thinks that we all are visiting a museum, not traveling somewhere. I walk faster than the green line on the major part of its routes. MBTA is a picture of apathetic Bostonians who would not complain to their local government even if they make them pay 100 % more for the ticket and offer less number of trains.  The blue line sometimes is decent and the red line as well. By the most part, I noticed how they have less number of trains on duty than they had before, while charging more for travel and not offering a service that would go at least until 2 am when most of the bars and clubs are opened and many people finish their work shifts."

The underground sections during the summer are an inferno and the fans are freaking useless.  It also doesn't make sense that the T officially closes around midnight. For some reason they are still running after midnight, yet I can't ride on them- I know this because I can hear them and every time they pass by and they interfere with my crappy wireless internet."

No, it's not a perfect system, but the fares are reasonable (though rising!) and with enough planning you can get anywhere you want in the greater boston metro area. Granted i've not witnessed any tales of horror that one hears of, and if nothing else it's a great place to catch a nap en route!"
239,4 star rating,"Apr 22, 2010","I love subways. I love nice big color-coded subway line maps that spiderweb across a city. I like the automated turnstiles...the roaring rush of a train pulling into a station. For as much as I adore subways, you'd think that I'd live in a city that actually has one. But I do not. Thus, I very much appreciate the ""subway experience"" when I travel elsewhere, and the ""T"" of Boston's MBTA is at the top of the list. The cars are pretty clean, the trains run frequently, and you can easily get pretty much anywhere in the city. It would be nice if they ran all night to accommodate late night revelry, but I suspect MBTA is intentionally avoiding the shenanigans that erupt when bars close their doors. A nice bonus is that many of the T stations have Dunkin Donuts located inside, which seems like a perfect combination for morning commuters.I spent much more time on subways than on buses while in Boston these past few days, and my couple of bus experiences weren't quite as superb as those of the T. The drivers seemed a little abrupt and one was visibly exasperated when I asked whether I ought to run my pass through the fare machine. I took the 71/73 out to Cambridge and back and I can definitely say that the bus wasn't running every 12 minutes on the return trip as expected. No problem for me as I wasn't in a rush, and I can't say whether the delay is indicative of the bus system in general."

She was 20 minutes behind schedule with another #9 behind her. Starts name calling, yelling, insults me for being slow and is generally aggressive for no reason. When I call her out for being rude,""that's so rude"", she becomes angry and kicks me off the bus. Won't even let me get her driver ID, had to grab bus number instead. Very unprofessional behaviour. Also yelled at another passenger for not letting an elderly further down in line on the bus first. Very belligerent and should be fired."

The closest subway station was Arlington from a local and she referred to the transit as the ""T"".  BTW, most of my comparison is with Toronto Transit Commission(TTC) of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.When I went down I noticed a service booth with a staff ready to assist when needed, however I also noticed throughout the day that they are not always there so do not depend on them as a reliable source if you're NEW to MBTA.  There are 3-4 Ticketing Machines that are very easy to use and accept most payments.  I had no problem getting my 1-Day Pass($9.00) CharlieTicket but the only negative was that I got $11.00 in one dollar coins which I was warned about from the friendly staff at this Arlington station.  I looked for a green arrow lighted up as I slipped my pass in the slot and it came out on top and the display gave me the go-ahead.  I stepped in front of the plastic transparent barrier and 1 SECOND after, it magically opened up.Be aware that Inbound train means heading towards the CITY while Outbound means to the suburbs.  I waited for the train in a somewhat worn down subway setting which still is better than TTC, however like TTC every station has a different appearance.  Even the trains were different from one line to another, some being modern while another being classical.Much like TTC there are announcements as to the next STOP however when its done in this method it can be missed by the patrons.  On the Orange Line I waited there forever waiting for the next train and sweated up a storm as a few of us struggled for prime position in front of 1 of 2 large fans."

246,3 star rating,"Oct 6, 2011","Great way to travel but with some major character flaws.  Some of the buses are still old and rickety, giving off lots of smoke and heat even in summer.  You need a step ladder to climb onto them, same with some of the Green Line trains.  One car on the Green Line is usually an old one which are much harder to climb into and out of for the mobility impaired.  You never know if it's going to be the first or last car so you stand in the middle of the platfrom somewhere.  There's a scramble for the new car's door when it arrives.  Drivers are sometimes really surly too and revel in slamming doors in the face of passengers rushing to enter the doors.  They scream through the loud speaker alerting passengers to their intent to close the doors right on them as they are trying to enter.  I was once dragged a few feet by an Orange Line train that slammed its doors on my cane and proceeded to drive away despite horrified screams from onlookers.  I was finally jostled free but the driver didn't stop until she had near cleared the station.  Had I still been stuck I would be Yelping to you through a medium.  A rep for the T took my name and info, no one ever called.  Total apathy and loathing for passengers by some factions at the T.  A rabid bum stood on the Park Street platform screaming obscenities at another passenger that had gotten on the Red Line train to Cambridge.  The train sat there idling with the doors open for quite some time, allowing this guy to exorcise his rage filled tirade uninterrupted and threaten the frightened passenger inside while the driver watched from a safe distance.  At the very least they should have closed the door instead of leaving the passenger on board open to be attacked at any time without interference from police or personnel.  People ask me why I wear a coat in summertime.  It's because of the AC that runs on some of the trains and buses on the T.  The air blow gustily and strong down your head and shoulders, especially on the new buses.  The temperature control is minimal from what I understand from the drivers.  It will be 56 degrees out in October and the AC is still on in the bus.  When the T works it's wonderful.  It's better than looking for parking in the city.  If the weather is lousy out leave the car at home.  The T is the best way to go.  Don't be fooled though.  The drunks on the T are that way for a reason.  ;)"

I hated waiting for the train, especially the Green line at Fenway. I loved the crackly announcements by that overly-perky woman (""Lllllladies and gentlemen...""). I hated the grouchy booth cashiers. One of them threw my money at me (I paid in nickels that day - I was broke, dammit) and told me to come back when I could pay ""real money."" But come on - it was always entertaining. My morning commute to Braintree was always made interesting by the guy with the beard who threatened to eat his Terry Goodkind novel if we didn't give him some ""speah change."" I moved from Boston right as they were implementing the new card system and phasing out the tokens. I see they've raised the price, too. It was still $1.25 when I lived there. Oh, the mornings of scrounging around for change so I didn't have to walk to work in the rain.I never understood why it doesn't run 24 hours, but it didn't affect me too much (except when I had early flights - trying to make it from Back Bay to Logan was a little hairy)."

And the killer part is that there's a yearly increase for us! The employees are so miserable, I can't understand it. They get paid substantially more than most and are just the absolutely obnoxious. Plus, when you ask for directions they literally NEVER know where they're going! And to be completely honest, it's not just that they're miserable people, they tend to antagonize some riders. Common sense lacks in most of the interactions I've seen and personally encountered. It's too bad that this is what the people of Boston are subjected to when using a service they need so desperately. Maybe that's the reason the operators take advantage and mistreat the riders."

That isn't much longer than it takes me to drive on most days. And the best part was the driver! He was the nicest bus driver I have ever had, hands down. Friendly, happy, helpful...all of that. And when I thanked him for my pleasant bus ride and he told me ""I made his day"".Sure, it did cost $3.50 for a one-way bus ride which would be kind of steep, if you had to do it everyday. But, I did find a free paper on the bus to keep me entertained, which was a bonus.Yeah, I know the T has it's crappy moments with delays and annoying passengers and grumpy drivers etc. But today, the T was perfect.

I went from the Airport, which was a little challenging with the buses to the subway then hopped on the subway to downtown then off the Alewife Station and found my friend's car in the large but run down parking structure.  The flooring of the parking structure was full of cracks, hard to avoid driving on them."

I love that I can get into and out of Boston without having to find parking and getting ripped off and paying for it.But you close at midnight...last call is at 1am.  That just doesn't make sense."
270,3 star rating,"Jan 24, 2006","I've usually found the T to be reliable. It will get you where you need to go and is damn cheap. Just these three things put it way ahead of the SF MUNI and London Tube (though I prefer the Paris Metro).A few things could be improved however:- it would be nice to be able to go from Back Bay to Cambridge without going via downtown. A line running along Mass Ave would be perfect- the token system is archaic and cumbersome. The airport stop has a nice new ticket system - when is this going to be rolled out?- when something does break down, the backup system is not very good. Last weekend, when the blue line broke, there were replacement busses from Maverick on, but it was total chaos, with no-one knowing where to go or which bus to board. It would also be nice if they let you know that there was a problem right at the entrance to the station, rather than letting you board a train before telling you. That way, people could catch a cab instead if they were in a hurry."

272,2 star rating,"Jan 12, 2015","I give them 1.5 because its not yet at the level of a third world country.    Subway service is expensive and unreliable.   The best way one friend put it was  ""The t can get you around Boston in 15 minutes or an hour but you never now which.""  The people working the system clearly are burnt out and hate humanity.   The few times you ask for help with a Charlie card they tell you to just 'hop in behind someone else' rather than get off their seat.Bus service has been surprising in that there is some semblance of a schedule.   However it is a horrible experience with disgusting buses and people insisting on taking up whole sections of the bus.  The cost of keeping a vague schedule is that mbta drivers blow through red lights regardless of who might be in the crosswalk.And the commuter rail.  Late almost daily, but they dont count it if its not more than 10 minutes..then they subtract 5 minutes from the actual delay.   It's significantly late at least once a week.   The dirty cars are packed during the high hours to the point of having people stand.  To add insult to injury,  the employees of this arm of service have some of the worst attitudes.   The culture varies by line but the one I take regularly (Fitchburg express) is bad.   Conductors that are the worst about violating quiet car rules, won't ask some kid to move his bag so an older woman can sit down, they even move slow opening the doors at a station stop.  Only time they show a little life is when someone complains about an issue or collection of tickets.  When someone complains they are quick to either shed blame or just tell the customer they are wrong.   When it's time to collect tix they hustle through so they can hang out together at the end of the train together away from riders.   The fun part of all this is that this line had a great conductor...so much so he was almost a character out of some black and white movie...professional,  nice, high energy,  knew customers names.... but the union forced him out of his position. Oh and bit costs thousands of dollars a year for many to ride the commuter rail There are mbta employees out there that are nice and hardworking people...but from our perspective,  they're outnumbered. Oh and any mbta construction or renovation project costs riders and taxpayers insane amounts of money and 10 times the time any one could reasonably expect."
273,1 star rating,"Jan 25, 2008","This organization is truly a joke.  It is full of hacks who got their jobs because they know someone who works for the state.  When I talk about hacks, I mean the management of the MBTA.  There are a handful of surly drivers, but for the most part, there are a lot of good drivers and conductors.  The T gets only one star because it is incredibly unreliable.  I thank God that I no longer need to depend on the T to get me to work.  Some days it would take 20 minutes to get to work, while on others it could be an hour and a half.  Another problem with the T is that they cannot complete any projects on time or on budget.  Just look at Kenmore station.  It was supposed to be done years ago and it still is far from finished.  What does the T do since they spend so much money on wasteful projects?  The raise fares of course, which drives away commuters.I strongly support public transit, but not when the agency doesn't put commuters first.  Nothing used to piss me off more than when the T's spokespeople would ridicule commuters in the old Starts and Stops column in the Globe.  One more thing, restore the Arborway!"
274,3 star rating,"Nov 1, 2010","Okay.  So, I used the T again this October.  It wasn't as awesome as on my first trip, but I suppose it wasn't hideous, either.We stayed out of town (in Braintree) due to the fact that we couldn't get a deal on a hotel in Boston proper.  We found a motel across from a T station and were thrilled.  We only found out when we showed up in Boston that, whoops, the Red Line was being worked on that weekend.  Crap.  So we had to use a shuttle bus for part of the trip.So why didn't I rate the T lower?  Frankly, the employees.  Maybe it's because I'm from the NYC area, but I found every single employee of the T to be friendly and helpful.  Despite the track work, everything seemed to run quite smoothly.  The trip took longer, but there was no confusion.So, not bad, overall."
275,4 star rating,"Jul 10, 2010","Up front: I'm only reviewing the subway, and as a tourist.First, a...question, I guess: I'm not sure how crazy passengers equal a problem with the system itself. I mean, it's *public* transportation, and some members of the public are plain f--king nuts (PFN).Now.  I happened to luuuuurrve my 4 day T experience.  Nearly all the stops are wheelchair-accessible - one can even board without having to find a conductor to find a portable ramp (or pray and do a wheelie).  That alone would've sold me.  But wait!  There's more!  The lovely, color-coded, easy-reader maps are awesome, of course.  The trains themselves seemed clean and seemed to run fairly often.  We didn't encounter any crabby employees (to the contrary - everyone was quite helpful).I understand that delays/breakdowns/drunks can make anyone PFN, but I wonder if they show up any more often than on any other subway line in any other major northeast city (the snow factor).  I'm looking forward to using the T again."
276,1 star rating,"Jan 7, 2010","The MBTA buses need a serious face lift....so gross!!!!I take the bus now only because I'd prefer not to freeze as I walk to work each day. Maybe I should toughen up, but ewwwww!The subway/trains are much more tolerable in my experience but not as accessible to get cross town and to the South End. Oh well, guess I'll just be sucking it up for the winter then back to walking as soon as the weather gets better :-)"
277,1 star rating,"Feb 18, 2015","The MBTA was bad before the weather turned ugly but it's even worse now! Long commute, three hours for a trip that should take 50 minutes. Trains and trolleys not running. Tracks not being cleared of snow. Bus stops with huge piles of snow that the MBTA doesn't clear. Our wonderful Governor (NOT) sits around talking about what's not his job in a state of emergency but if he had to get out of that SUV of his and take the T, it would be fixed immediately!  Horrible delays and now they say 30 days to fix it! Thirty days and when it's ""back to running"" the service will probably be as horrible as it was before!"
278,2 star rating,"Sep 7, 2014","BLEGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH. The MBTA is the bane of my existence. I'm literally counting down the days until I no longer have to rely on this god-awful service. In fairness, It's mostly the Green Line and the buses (OHHHHHHHHH, the buses) that cause the majority of the headaches. The Orange, Red, and Blue lines are usually OK. USUALLY. But not always. But the Green Line and the stupid buses are the WORST. UGH UGH UGH. I cannot express my contempt for having to rely on both of those terrible parts of the MBTA every single day. The amount of times my commute has been extended by 20, 30, 40, 50, and yes even 60 WHOLE MINUTES, simply because a scheduled bus never showed, or was dreadfully late, or there were ""power problems on the orange line"" or it took 25 minutes to wait for a Lechmere train to finally come to North Station. It goes on and on. Unless your commute is just Red Line only, or Orange Line only, you are likely going to experience some sort of problems. And how is there no crosstown subway??? The only way to get from cambridge/allston areas to the JP/southern areas is to take the 66 (pfffffffft) or the 1 bus (pffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffft) There really ought to be another subway line that addresses these problems. I've seen a few really nice theoretical subway maps that DO address them. I'd beg for their implementation, but since nothing would get done until long after I've stopped using the MBTA, I don't really care. Also, can we talk about how drug deals and usage go down every day at the BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER 1 bus stop? Seriously??? That needs to be addressed. So does pretty much everything else about the 1 bus, but I digress. And the fact that I sent 2-3 emails asking why scheduled 88 buses just never showed and I was stuck waiting 40 minutes in the frigid cold Boston winter waiting for another one to finally arrive? Never answered. Again, I'm am counting down the days until I no longer need to rely on this awfulness."

I'm a nurse in Boston and take the commuter rail on days when I can't drive in and literally almost EVERY time I take the train it is delayed or cancelled, yet they raise prices every year and promise better service. If you can avoid it, don't ever take the train. Not worth it. You'll end up calling into work late almost every day. Not only that, but the MBTA does a terrible job of notifying you that there is a delay while you are at the station. You have to just keep refreshing the app to wait for an explanation of why the train is so late. I often find myself taking a train that is several hours earlier than I need to be taking just because I know there will be a delay. Worst service ever."

I take the red and green line and bus everyday, and I can guarantee a train will be taken out of service at least 3 times per week. I am writing a review today because I have never gotten such horrible service before. This was on the green line, when for some reason the green line was disabled, so everyone had to wait outside in the rain for the shuttle busses. I waited for the first one... packed. Second one...not packed, but got kicked out because the bus driver changed his mind last minute about sticking to the rules about the ""entire body has to be behind the line"" thing. Third time... 5 minutes passed and no shuttle, so instead I walked 3 stations to change to the red line..."
285,4 star rating,"May 21, 2015","I can see how this system would drive commuters crazy but if you're just a visiting tourist this is an experience you mustn't miss! For instance, we all got on one trolley-train labeled ""Heath Street"", then they turfed us off to go over to another trolley-train labeled ""Riverside"" and announced verbally (loud voice!) that the Riverside was now a Heath Street line. This was missed by one passenger who was visibly annoyed once the trolley-train got above ground and she found she wasn't on the Riverside line.  However, if you aren't in a hurry, big ole clanking trolley cars screech their way slowly out of the hub station (Park Street) via tunnels dug over a century ago and then make it out to above ground stops on the roads. But they will take you (sortof) to wherever you want to go, or near enough, with a Charlie card that you can use on bus or trolley etc. It's allegedly wheelchair accessible -- and I did see hand-crank lifts to get wheelchairs into the trolley cars -- but little signage or other written assistance and if there were elevators, they are tucked away so this is going on my ""Not wheelchair accessible"" list."

I rarely drive as I live on the red line, a two block walk from my house and work off of the red line. Which is great for me but must be difficult for others farther from the sparsely located stations. After 15 years living in NYC riding the subway I miss it!"

My husband and I travelled to Boston from Abington every day.  It was great!  Didn't have to deal with the crazy streets, traffic and expensive parking in Boston.  One can transfer conveniently throughout the underground network railway system. The stations are clean, and we never felt unsafe in our travels.

296,3 star rating,"Sep 22, 2011","First off, I come from an area with a pretty much D-rated public transportation system. So I, Julie D. am not savvy to the ways of the train system. So, when hopping the train at Copley Station, I wasn't smart enough to pick the one going the right direction. While I am looking at how to cross the tracks to get to the ""other"" side, someone is kind enough to point out to me that I have to go back to the street, cross it, go around the corner and pick that station. Stupid tourist! And, crap, I have already paid my $$. So, I use a nearby phone to call up the help line. They tell me to simply hold up my ticket up big and proud and slip though the gates with another passenger. Well, don't you know a very loud alarm goes off and people stop and stare. But that's okay, because I am holding my ticket up. Gawd, help me. Next issue, the train comes. It is packed with a ton of people. People behind me are pushing to get on, so I go with them. We are like sardines. Did I mention we are going to the Sox's game? Yes, that explains the gazillion peeps on the train. So, someone at the front of our car manages to get stuck in the front door, so it won't close. Then, a message appears on the board saying ""this train is out of service"". Yay. Then there is the announcement on the speaker system, ""this train is out of service"". Double yay. So, people start to shout ""hey, open the door, we need to get off"". Well, the door doesn't open and even if it did, I'm not getting off. This goes on for quite some time. People are getting mean and shouting ""open that door"". Crazy town. I don't think I would want to be in a life or death situation with some of these people. So, finally the door at the very back of the train opens and people start pushing their way out. And about 30 seconds later and door closes. And we are on our way. Gawd. So, the trip was pretty much uneventful after that. And so was our trip back.  The trains and stations seemed pretty clean, however I never got a look at the seats.  I love public transportation.  I wish I had some!"

If the MBTA want's more riders, they should make this experience easier by partnering with more stores to sell these cards.  I called the MBTA help line and they were NOT helpful with providing information about purchasing a card in the Waltham area.    I was told the only way I could get a card is at a subway station.  I don't ride the subway and have no reason to go there!!  I was told that was the only place I could purchase a card.   The online information did identify one store called the Village Market.        My first bus ride, the driver was angry at me because I was going to pay in cash for my trip.   Bus line 70A.....He let me on for free. He said if I used the ticked machine on the bus it would only ""screw up"" the machine.    Once again, NOT a good experience for someone who is new to the area."

Oh yeah, they are hanging out near Dunkies or conspicuously absent.  -99.9% of the employees are complete assholes with bad attitudes.  Get off your freaking cell phone!  You are getting paid 65k a year to sit in a booth and do nothing.  At least be a pleasant human being.-Props to the charming bus driver doing the goddamn Metro crossword puzzle on his steering wheel while driving!  You go!-Most of the stations are dirty and dated. -In my lifetime I have seen the fares nearly triple.  Yet the service remains totally shitty.  Where is this money going?  -Complete bureaucracy. (see above)-Service ends at 12:45...  'nuff said-I haven't heard it yet but I'll add it to my list - that the MBTA has the audacity to think that most people would want to listen to T-radio.  If your ridiculous vehicle for driving out musicians and making revenue on advertisements was making the service better, longer and safer I would be all for it. I doubt that is the cause. Shut that shit off!I have strong feelings.  What can I say.*One positive thing.  Riding the Red Line between Kendall and Alewife I generally have no problems."
299,1 star rating,"Mar 24, 2010","""Help! I'm stuck in the Downtown Crossing station,"" was how I started my phone call to the MBTA Police a few weeks ago.Not. Even. Kidding.It was a Friday night, a little after 1AM, and a co-worker and I exited the train and passed through one of those old fashioned turn-styles -- you know the kind, the revolving door with black, germ infested bars jutting out like evil teeth...An MBTA drone locked it behind us, which we thought nothing of, and got on the escalator to head towards freedom, fresh air, and, most importantly, last call and a bathroom.  I had to pee like nobody's business.I mean, I really had to pee.I cannot stress this enough.We got to the top of the escalator, walked straight, turned the corner and lo and behold, the grating was down over the exit/entrance to the station.Trapped.We ran down the upward bound escalator, got to the bottom, and started yelling for the MBTA employee who locked the revolving door.  No response.  No luck.  Gone.  That mofo made a suspiciously quick exit.Two phone calls and 35 minutes later, an MBTA car pulls up and two henchmen get out.  Both were disgruntled, androgynous looking things who were completely cold and unapologetic.  I swear one of them had a giant, circular key chain and used a skeleton key on the padlock for the grating.I jokingly tried to convince them to drive us home.  ""No.""  When that didn't work I tried to convince them to hail us a taxi.  ""No.""  Well, boo.I still had to pee.If I didn't have a sense of humor, I'd be pretty angry.  That said, I can't believe how long it took them to respond to our call.  We sat in the cold station for 35 minutes.  People kept walking by staring at us, which really just made me stick my arm through the grate and reach out at them.Anyway, this was a pretty traumatic experience.  I almost shaved my head and attacked the MBTA car with an umbrella."

That is so disinterested in improving their extremely lackluster performance. It's never on time. I am not sure if there is even a schedule. Most employees are rude. They financially try to get over on you on the reg. It is a direct representation of how our state is run. Poorly.
311,1 star rating,"Apr 20, 2015",The MBTA SUBWAY is a joke. They make delay announcements in the stations that are inaccurate and so infrequently they can collect revenue from folks who are trying to get to the commuter rail that end up walking. Of course there isn't any refunds offered. We have been dealing with this all winter long and now it looks like we will have to deal with it again all Spring. Do you consider 25 minute delays as minir? I don't.
312,1 star rating,"Oct 18, 2006","I arrived at Kenmore at 10:48 pm last night. No one was there waiting, so I assumed I just missed the bus and would have to wait 15-20 minutes. I didn't have the bus schedule on me, but know that the 57 always runs every 15-20 minutes at that time. 30 minutes later about 40 people were waiting and grumbling with me. The bus finally pulled up at 11:19pm. I grabbed a schedule as I boarded the bus and the bus driver humorously commented: ""Picking up some fictional reading, huh?"" The schedule stated there was a 10:45 bus, an 11:00 bus and an 11:20 bus. The 11:00 bus never ran! This is not the first time that a bus never showed up, and I can't fathom how you can just not run a scheduled bus altogether. It's not that it was a few minutes late - IT NEVER CAME. With the recent announcement of the fare hikes, I find it reprehensible that an entire bus route is just skipped, but I have to pay more. Also, I find it amusing that even the bus drivers know the printed schedules are a joke and they are rarely accurate. I have more skipped bus stories and service complaint stories to count.  But I do appreciate that the service is available - even if it isn't consistent.  Generally, it's decent, but I expect the buses to actually show up.EDIT:  Here is a complaint I wrote in to the MBTA this morning, after another skipped bus service.  I am downgrading my rating to 1 star now.  ""My boyfriend and I went to a concert at Harper's Ferry last night.  I got tired and took the car home early.  Tom said he would stay until the concert ended and take the bus home.  We know the 57 schedule and know there are trains until at least 12:30.  The concert got out at about 12:15 am this morning.  Tom waited at the bus stop, but became cold, so started walking home toward Brighton Center.  We live along the 57 route, so he walked along, pausing at each bus stop, hoping to catch the bus the rest of the ride home.  When he finally got home after 1 am, he had not seen one bus pass him, neither inbound nor outbound.  If there are supposedly buses being run at 12:30 in each direction, and according to your schedule it only takes approximately 18 minutes to get from Kenmore to Watertown Yard, how did he not see one single bus on his walk from Brighton Ave through Washington Ave?  This service is despicable.  People count on your service to get them home and instead, they are forced to walk over a mile and a half in the middle of the night. The price increases are an outrage, considering you don't even run bus service after 12:15, even though you say you do.  If driving didn't cost so much, and parking were more readily available, I would boycott the MBTA altogether, given the horrendous service I've experienced.  It's been especially heinous these past few months that I've been living in Brighton.  This is the second time I've complained in two weeks about a missed trip on the 57. I don't often take the 57 because I commute in on the 503.  However, my last experience on the 57 was a skipped bus from Kenmore and now, my boyfriend had to walk home because another bus didn't run.  How can we plan to use the service if two out of the last two times we've tried to take it, it hasn't even run on it's scheduled times???  You're batting 1000 here, but not in a good way."""
313,1 star rating,"Nov 25, 2014",The MBTA is the. worst. The idea that anyone would give this operation anything over one star blows my rushed and frenzied mind. I used to show up to work and social functions on time. I prided myself on my punctuality. Now I leave my house for a place that takes me 25 minutes to bike to and arrive in about an hour. On a good day. Green line trains show up in inconsistent waves and packed with flying elbows and disgruntled commuters. Orange line smells like urine and is only marginally better in its organization. And the Red Line seems to choose which doors to leave open based on which side has less people needing to board a train. Boston is a decent city but the MBTA feels like a failed middle schooler's attempt at transiting commuters to and from their daily destinations.
314,3 star rating,"Apr 4, 2012","An A-OK public transportation system.The good: It is well organized and reliable. Stops are conveniently located. Between trains and buses, it is possible to get almost anywhere in the city. The Silver Line was a great addition. Fares are reasonable.My wish list: I wish the Green Line didn't stop every two blocks. I wish there were some sort of Red Line-Green Line connector out west so I didn't have to travel 90 minutes or more to get to Newton from Davis (a drive that takes 15-20).""The next train arrives in XX minutes"" signs like they have in DC would be nice. More detailed information on delays would also be nice. ""Attention customers, the Red Line is currently experiencing delays"" can mean anything from ""There was a disabled train earlier but things are back to normal now,"" to ""Things are going to be a bloody mess for the next several hours so don't bother waiting.""In a lot of the cars--it seems like more than half--the intercom either doesn't work or is turned down so low that it's inaudible. This might seem like a non-essential feature, but whenever there is a problem (often) it becomes really, really important. When there is a delay, It doesn't help that the driver is making announcements every two minutes if nobody can hear it.My best example: I was taking the train home from Harvard Square to Davis, as I do nearly every day, and standing on the outbound platform as usual. I was confused when a train pulled in going the opposite direction. it was announced that an outbound train would be coming shortly.When the next train came, it was going in the right direction, so I got on. And waited. And waited. And waited. At least 10 minutes, maybe 15, as the train filled up. No announcements were made (that I could hear). Then, the announcer came over the intercom: ""The next stop for this train will be Central."" WRONG DIRECTION! The train was turning around and going inbound! I hastily exited the train before the doors could close and asked a T worker on the platform if there would be an outbound train coming soon. She rolled her eyes, gestured to the lower platform, and said, ""That train already left. We MADE the announcement."" So, they had inbound trains leaving from the outbound platform, outbound trains leaving from the inbound platform, and a worker standing right on the platform who couldn't be bothered to walk up and down the train making the announcement at the open doors of a waiting train, since the PA system was apparently broken (or not--they managed to announce which station was next!). At that point I just gave up and took the bus instead.The charade they go through every spring--threatening to jack up fares and cut service drastically (e.g., threatening to eliminate all bus lines), holding the legislature hostage until they get their budget funded, which they ultimately always do--is annoying.The commuter rail is pretty good if you are in fact commuting into Boston from the burbs. However, it would be nice if the service were more frequent at off-peak times. It would be nice to be able to take the train to my friends' place in Wakefield on a weekend, but there are trains only every 2 hours or so. If you go to Providence for some Saturday-night fun and want to come back to Boston at the end of the night, you've got to be on the train by 10 p.m. The first train on Sunday isn't until 11:20!!And of course, I wish the T ran 24 hours. I essentially can't take the train to the airport if my flight leaves before 8 or 9 a.m., because the first train is 5:30ish. And if you get in close to midnight, good luck if your flight is delayed at all. You're looking at a $40 cab ride.But all in all, my life is far better with the T than it would be without it."

I can zone out the window, and get to where I'm going within an hour--that's about anywhere, even with one, two transfers.Try living in the South.  I'm not sure all of you realise how good you have it here.  And now, so do I.Clean stations; some are really pretty.  Comfortable chairs.  Friendly enough employees.  It's safe.  Nice vibe.  People are mellow, and give up their seats.Of course I wish more stations had bathrooms.  Of course I wish the busses ran more often, but fuck's sake, the Trains run what?  Every ten minutes?  Twenty at most?  Of course I wish they ran later (my only true complaint).Some of you don't know how good we have it up here.  Paper vs. tokens.  I get you.  Somebody gave me a token.  It is pretty.  Yay; natural materials.  Feels nice in your hand.Try Florida; try Birmingham, AL.  Decent state; great city.  Try having to own a car, or else wait 45 minutes, average, for busses that very often don't run on time.  And whose operators are generally anything but friendly.  Try living in a ""city"" that is so spread out that there is very little general community--only pocket neighborhoods--and might as well call itself a big town.  A public transport system as integrated as this one is a huge element in making Greater Boston a pedestrian city, and in my view they're not doing badly at all.Oh, and (strangely) except for at Copley station, three times in a row, the agents have all been cool as fuck, quite helpful, and friendly.god bless the MTBA (neither piety nor irony intended).Some of you don't know how good you have it.

But of all the places I've been (L.A., D.C., NYC, Atlanta, Chicago, Dublin, Boston, etc.), Boston has the fastest and most regular system I've seen. Maybe that isn't saying a lot. Maybe all of our systems need overhaul. But I never have to wait long for a train when I'm here, and there's always a station near the places I want to go (even in the near 'burbs), it isn't overly expensive, and it's relatively clean (except for that one station, but we won't talk about that). It's public transit. It will never be perfect. But you guys have got it good, for sure."

Our family of four waited at the stop and our bus blew right past--leaving us waiting 20+ minutes for the next bus (and plenty of time to write this unhappy review)!Thankfully, we don't have a tour time or we'd have missed it. This is a fairly inexpensive option, but not reliable. We've used Uber 4 times while in Boston--the drivers were super nice and available within a few moments--even after a Red Sox game! My advice if you're a visitor using this system: if you need to be somewhere on time, look up your destination's travel route/time and tack on at least 30 more minutes. We had a much easier time with NYC public transit when we visited a few years ago."

326,1 star rating,"May 19, 2014","The worst public transit system I've ever taken, and unfortunately I must use it every day. The service is extremely slow and poorly designed.The T features outdated subway routes which never run on time or as frequent as they should. The commuter rail is typically 5-10 minutes late. In my 3 years of taking it I don't believe that it's ever been less than 2-3 minutes late. My experiences with the DC metro, Septa, and NYC subway in the past make the T look pathetic."
327,2 star rating,"Nov 9, 2011","The MBTA is not bad when it is working.  BUT that is WHEN it is working.   A few weeks ago there was a small snow storm, so the T was shut down between Central and Downtown and we had to take a bus to the next stop but the driver didn't tell us when we were at each stop.  When someone asked why the T was shut down the response from the MBTA worker was ""it is snowing and the elevator is broken"".  I don't know if that makes sense to anyone else.Another time the commuter rail was over 2 hours late and no one showed up to tell the hundreds of morning commuters to find another way to work.  Even an announcement would have made me feel slightly better but we were all left stranded and wondering...ALSO, wayyyyyy too many stop on the buses.  If I can see the title of the book the person is reading at the next stop over, the stops are TOO CLOSE!  It makes the ride longer than necessary."

331,3 star rating,"Apr 13, 2006","It's weird how the reviews here just plummet after last year.  My major issues with the T are that it shuts down too early and the express trains can make you really friggin' irritated if you have to be somewhere.  I swear some of those bitches on the train even polish smug looks as they blaze past your station without stopping.  I did just read -- in the metro newpaper that they hand out for free (+1 star for real human hands that you can say good morning to consistently) in front of subways stations --  that partially because of our mass transit system, Boston is the second best city to live in just in case we have some crazy oil supply shortage.  Till then you'll just have to accept that sometimes the T really sucks."
332,1 star rating,"Jan 21, 2008","I was naive enough to assume that Boston's T would be a quick, convenient, cheap way to travel around the Boston area. I gave up my car to come here and didn't expect problems. Well, I suppose I forgot that#1 This is Americaand#2 Boston just don't give a f*ckEven the Czech Republic has a more efficient system. I want to cry every time I ride the T and that's at least once a day. What is up with the pointless test trains every hour? What needs to be tested so often? What is up with half-full trains that don't stop for no reason whatsoever? What is up with the dirty floors? Do they ever get cleaned? Can they clean them while they test them? Why are the stations so ugly? Why do trains not come for 15 minutes, then 3 at once even going outbound (before street level) Please, someone, overhaul this system. I'm also pretty unhappy with the general geographical area the T travels. First of all, why is there no easy way to get across the river? Why are there stops every 30 feet by BU? Kids can walk. All I can say is, if you think the T is great then you should never travel. Once you go to Europe and see the amazing technology in places like Berlin and Paris (where I lived for a short time - I will kiss the metro the next time I go) you will never be able to withstand the Boston T. It just kills me."
333,4 star rating,"Sep 21, 2007","I'm really sad that there's so much hate about the MBTA here. Okay, it's no Chicago El but I would rather have ""semi-reliable"" service (which is very reliable if you're not on the greenline) than a car. Compared to owning a car, it's cheap. The monthly pass that includes unlimited train and bus service is 59 dollars. That's about 1 round-trip a day; on face value, it doesn't seem like a deal. If you make multiple trips a day, or if you make a stop on your way home, however, it will definitely save you money. I live right on the green line so I hardly ever take a bus. I know that they're more unreliable but, hello, it's a bus. Traffic does exist in this world. Overall, it could be better but so could everything else in the universe."

335,4 star rating,"May 14, 2012","People in Boston love to complain about the T. But in all honesty, if you visit other places, you'll quickly come to realize that the T is generally clean, and cheap in comparison to other systems (I'm looking at you NYC). The heavy rail subways (blue, red and orange) move pretty fast, with reasonable frequency. The light rail line (green) is pretty slow, but realistically, the b and c lines could be better served by dedicated bus lanes than by rail. Are there things that they could do better? Yes, of course. But let's give them a little credit for what they do right. Boston is fourth in the country for the percentage of people who use transit, and fares are really low compared to other systems."
336,5 star rating,"Jun 25, 2005","Ok, I don't live there so you locals may have your gripes but I'm coming from California where Mass Transportation is still in that ""I've just crawled out of the sea and need to evolve some legs"" stage of evolution.  I loved the ""T"", the prices were good, the efficiency seemed good, and it went all over the place and went often.  I loved how when we visited the region we didn't even need a car for anything.  The lady I was with, she and I wanted to check out Plymouth Plantation so we caught the Red Line to South Station, caught the commuter rail to Plymouth, took a bus a ways and then walked a few blocks and there we were.  We went everywhere this way and loved it.  You can kind of do that in the SF Bay Area but it is tricky at times.  We loved the versatility and functionality of it and were envious of what a cool system it was."

339,3 star rating,"Jan 28, 2008","Talk about a mixed bag. The thought of even trying to write coherent paragraphs about the T makes me want to adopt the rocking fetal position in a corner of the room. Instead, I'll stick with the good, the bad, and the ugly.The good: -The red line has rarely, if ever, let me down. No transportation system is ever going to be perfect, but in my opinion, the red line is the best in Boston as far as staying on schedule, accomodating crowds, and taking you from point A to point B in a reasonable amount of time.-All of the green lines are far from perfect, but I can usually live with the C line. It seems to run more frequently than its green counterparts, and it doesn't take too too long. It also stops at places that I actually need/want to go. Yeah, the D is quick and there aren't many stops, but how often do I really need to go into suburban Newton?The bad: The green B line. Ugh, where to begin. Okay, it's a nice convenience to have a T stop literally steps from my front door, and obviously that beats the alternative of not having one nearby. But living and commuting at Harvard Ave. has to be one of the single most frustrating experiences alive. Back when I used to work in Government Center, it was always a total crapshoot trying to judge when I would arrive at work, particularly if the weather was bad, because apparently Harvard Ave. is the do-or-die cut off point for express trains. I can't tell you how many times I've seen a train stop just up the street, but then blow by the tons of people waiting in the rain, snow, or freezing cold, leaving them with looks on their faces like they're ready to kick Lassie. (There is a flip side to this of course- if you're on the train that gets expressed, seeing the look on those suckers' faces is one of life's small pleasures.) My biggest gripe with the B is its lack of consistency. You just never know what you're going to get with it. The ugly:Goddamn you 66 bus. First, if I wanted to deal with traffic, I would get a car, so that part is my own fault. But how is it that the MBTA STILL has not figured out how to space these things out even somewhat evenly? If I had a nickel for every time I've seen two 66 buses putt-putting up Harvard Ave doggy style, I would be a rich man. It drives me absolutely batshit, to the point where I regularly risk the loss of one or more extremities by walking to work in the freezing cold, rather than wait to see if I will be blessed with the presence of a 66 within a reasonable time frame."

343,3 star rating,"Feb 11, 2008","Figuring out how many stars is difficult--I mean, should I rate the MBTA in the context of transportation networks in the U.S.?  In the developed world?  In the known universe?  I couldn't decide, so I averaged the three ratings:Context of the U.S.: 4 stars.  The major plusses are:- Racially and socioeconomically integrated!  After living in Boston for a while, I had forgotten than in America, white people drive, and people of color people take the bus.  Recent trips to Philly and DC made me appreciate that in Boston, people with the means to own a car do not see taking public transportation as slumming, and melaninically-challenged people do not have an aversion to being locked into a passenger cabin with blacks or latinos.- Inexpensive! Granted, for just 30 cents more, you can travel anywhere on the much more extensive NYC subway, but compared to any other city in the U.S., it's hard to get somewhere far and get there efficiently for only $1.70.- Decent connection to the airport! Both the blue line and the silver line bus, which, for a bus, is pretty sweet, more or less go to the airport, and with enough frequency and consistency that you're not going to miss a flight because you got unlucky with the T.  To get to the airport in San Francisco you have to take the infrequent BART, and in DC you can't get there (there = Dulles) yet, and in Philly it's really expensive and the rest of the transportation system sucks so unless you live near where the airport train goes, it's difficult.   Major minuses:- Silly, silly layout.  Yes, the T has to deal with the cow-path-based geography of Boston, and yes, it was built incrementally rather than conceived of rationally as an integrated system, but just because it's not the current T's fault that its layout is lousy doesn't mean it doesn't get docked for it.  I mean, the orange and green lines downtown are a friggin' block away from each other?  Why not space them out so you can cover more of the downtown?  Also, stops on the green line (mainly the B and C) are unnecessarily close together.- No express trains.  This is especially a problem on the green line, where, due to stops at intersections, trains frequently get bunched up at busy times.  Occasionally, the crowded, slow train in the front will declare itself an express train and skip a couple stops, which makes eminent sense, but there really should be a more regular system of expressness.- Buses are infrequent and don't stick to the schedule.  Taking the bus is workable if one of the following is true: (1) you have tons of time on your hands and a book of crosswords; (2) the bus picks you up on schedule and drops you off on schedule.  This requires planning on your part, but even in the cell-phone age, most of us can still do it; or (3) the bus is frequent enough so it doesn't matter if there's no schedule or it doesn't follow it.  Unless (1) applies, MBTA buses with a few exceptions are not workable.  Sometimes they're early, sometimes they're late, sometimes they're so late that it's as if they were early.- Stops at 12:30.  In most of the U.S., people drive drunk all the time.  This happens less in Boston thanks to the T, but if it ran later on Friday and Saturday (like the usually-stopping-at-12:30-but-staying-open-till-3:00-on-weekends DC metro does), we'd all be better off.  Fund the later weekend hours with a 1-dollar surcharge on drinks dispensed after midnight--people will be happy to pay a few more bucks when staying out late if they then save big on cab fare.Context of the developed world: 2 stars   Major pluses:Eh, not many.  It's not a complete loss, so it gets more than just one star.  But come on, three train lines, one of which nobody uses (blue line), a couple streetcars (green lines), worthless buses--just this for what's supposed to be a second-tier world-class city?  Major minuses:As you can see, some of the minuses have been included in the pluses section, so here's a list w/o explanation:- Usually quicker to ride your bike.  If the weather weren't so awful in the winter and Americans didn't have an aversion to biking to work, no one would bother with the T.- Bumpy, jerky, rickety old rails and trains.  The U.S. may be the richest country in the world, but you'd have no idea and you'd lobby your government to be more generous with its foreign aid if all you saw of America were the MBTA.- The MBTA has the chutzpah to pretend that the Silver Line is the equal of the actual rail lines.  The comfort and efficiency of a bus, at the price of a subway!- Seriously, mold colonies in Europe and Japan have better transit systems. Context of the known universe: 3 stars.  Damn, this is way too long already, but you get the picture."

345,5 star rating,"Jul 30, 2014","I'm not too familiar with any subway transit systems. Coming from Hawaii, I felt our bus system is pretty good. Riding it off and on for the last 35 years. But now, since I've experienced the MBTA, it will be the only way I travel when visiting Boston. (Right now, the island of Oahu is in the process of building an above-ground transit system, which I am not in favor of. Which is a totally different story/review...) I got a 7 day pass ($18), which I used only for a few days, but was well worth it. Getting from point A to point B to point C in only a few minutes, and not being stuck in traffic! The wait for the next train was never more than 5 minutes. BONUS at one of the stations, their was a guy playing a bass guitar for tips. He was pretty damn good! As for complaints... 1) Never use the elevator! I rode in 2 different elevators at 2 different stations and they both smelled like urine! My advise, don't be lazy and TAKE THE STAIRS! LOL! 2) Don't rush, leave a little early! One morning we had Duck Boat Tour and had to make it to the Prudential Convention CTR, but one of the trains had mechanical problem. Instead of waiting, we walked from Kenmore Square. It took about 30 minutes. So be prepared! 3) A couple of times we had trouble with our tickets. Once, my ticket got stuck and keep on going in and out of the turnstile machine. I had grab it and yank it out. Another time, my wifes ticket didn't even work. Luckily a janitor was present, he let us in. So would I recommend MBTA? YES!!! I know I have a few complaints, but the positives out weight the negatives. Whenever I go on a vacation, I always drive and navigating through traffic for hours on end, which feels like work. So just hanging on and enjoying the ride, now that's my kind on vacation."
346,3 star rating,"Dec 7, 2010","I took the commuter rail from South Station to Foxboro for the Patriots/Jets game (GO PATS!) and it was alright. They guarantee an arrival to Gillette one hour before kick off and we got there at 8pm for an 830pm kick off. Because of the long entry/security lines, we barely got to our seats by the time the teams came on to the field.  It left 30 minutes after game time, as promised, but once we started up we stopped and just sat on the train for a solid 20-25 minutes without any announcement. That's my biggest pet peeve with the T - lack of communication. I can handle delays if I know what's up!  I would definitely recommend going to South station to board if you have the time. It fills up quickly. All that being said, it's a relaxing ride where you can close your eyes and not worry about traffic. I would take it again in a heart beat."
347,2 star rating,"Aug 11, 2014","The service sometimes sucks, especially the green line. There's no schedule when the subway train is going to come, and sometimes I have to wait for a while. I remembered I was late for class because of the train. The mbta should know that there are people who has places to go to, and majority of them go to work or school in Boston. Therefore, we can't afford to be late. Another factor is that some of the conductors are rude to the passengers. I remembered a conductor won't let my friend go into the subway because he ""doesn't look like a soldier"" when he's clearly in his uniform AND showed him his military ID! SERIOUSLY?!? I've been on the subway for years and I've never heard anything like that. My friend have no problem passing through as long he showed them his ID (which is a policy I saw looking through their website); conductor let soldiers go in for free as long they show them their military ID. But this conductor was so rude to him! I also have other very rude and weird stories while I was on the mbta.And the cost for the mbta is expensive as well. However, thank god they have discounts and passes for making a commuter's life easier. Anyhow, it's whatever for me because I only use it for transportation to go somewhere I need to go if it's a long walk.If you wanna take the subway, green line is the slowest and comes in randomly. Other lines are a bit better."

The bus stops at a guard rail(!) next to the sidewalk, with no crosswalk (!), forcing all who get off either to walk on Route 9 (!) back to the nearest crosswalk (which is also at the previous T stop), jump that guardrail to the sidewalk and walk back to the crosswalk, or to dash across Route 9 to the medical building.

349,1 star rating,"May 19, 2010","""due to thursday's incident at downtown crossing, we are operating with delays in service ... ""the preceding announcement was actually broadcast at red line stations for a week and a half after the 'incident' in question took place (it was an electrical fire). this, in spite of the surprising fact that the T seemed to run uncharacteristically smoothly in the days that followed. it's almost as though the managers decided to leave the announcement in place to be milked in the event the system did actually run up against all its standard glitches (""signal problems,"" ""disabled trains up ahead,"" etc.). the above announcement and its factual context seem to encapsulate nearly everything wrong with T. you have the decrepit equipment failing and sparking subsequent delays in service, the vague announcements that do little to educate you on the hold-ups, thereby making it hard to estimate how late you're going to be to wherever you're going, and a breed of apathy bordering on willful contempt for passengers. other good stuff: orange line trains that seem to run on a schedule consistent with the passing of halley's comet, a B train choked up all bottleneck-like with a series of stops within about a block of each other leading up to the green line's busiest intersection, and buses that run so out of whack with schedule that it's not at all uncommon to see a merry caravan of two or three of the same bus going the same route spaced within a car or two of one another."
350,2 star rating,"May 27, 2014",One of the less efficient and reliable subway systems compared to others in the USA and abroad. Most of the drivers are rude and do not have the skills/training to deal with a multicultural/diverse population in Boston. Delayed service most of the time. Insufficient trains to serve a growing population resulting in packed trains during peak service hours. This subway system is not at level as it should be for an important city as Boston. Disappointing overall.
351,2 star rating,"Sep 9, 2010","Just some commentary, having ridden on many public transport systems throughout the world. Ours is not the worst, but far from good.  Each city presents its own logistic challenges in terms of topography, and population, but the T just doesn't seem to want to make itself work.  A couple of necessary improvements: 1. gotta run till 2:30--- (a huge part of taking transport is to prevent driving drunk..running till 2:30 would be a huge economic boon to the T as well as establishments in downtown Boston.   2.  Circle line--- though expensive, a circle line running from somerville-brighton/brookline-JP-South End/Back Bay-Cambridge would unify multiple lines and give a myriad of options to the rider.  Suddenly it would make sense for tens of thousands more people to ride the t.  3.  Better Stations-- kiosks, smoothies, bars, convenience stores provide money making opportunities for the mbta, and a much better ride for the consumer.  Kill 2 birds with one stone.  4.  easiest fix of all..PLEASE cut the number of stops at BU in half.  SO unnecessary.  Other pipe dreams include burying the greenline, quieter tracks and trains, and maybe a couple more cameras so  the thugs actually feel like they are being watched."

Why can't you be more efficient in your daily work to make sure we can get to where we need to in a timely fashion. I believe that every T employee should be required to take the T. Then they would go through the same bs the rest of us do. I don't understand why it's so difficult to get things done in a timely fashion. You basically have to take people from point A to point B. Yet you find it so damn difficult, whether via train or bus there's always something that comes up. It is so frustrating & makes it difficult to not be constantly annoyed due to these circumstances. So many other cities don't run into even a 1/4 of the problems you do. You think all these fare hikes are what's going to solve the T's money problems, it's not. Making service actually happen w/put so many issues should be your primary focus. There isn't a day that goes by that problems don't arise on every single line & that is ridiculous & completely unacceptable."

362,2 star rating,"Jul 8, 2008","I give the T two stars because it's not all horrible.  At the right times, it actually gets me where I need to be relatively quickly.  I live across the street from a T, and my school was across the street from the same T, so in that sense it was always very convenient.  I have huge gripes about their Greater Boston service.  It should not be an epic journey every single time someone in Allston/Brookline travels to Cambridge.  On a bike or in a car, it takes me approx 15-20 minutes to get to Cambridge, on the T it can take me an hour and at times has taken me two hours.  TWO AGONIZING HOURS.  Seriously, I'm not going to New Hampshire.The worst is their late night service.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that on Saturday nights they run a last T at 1:45am.  I don't know if this is for all lines, but it's taken me home a few times, usually after I see a bus thinking it's the last one and then am forced to sit there for an hour and a half waiting for it to leave, annoyed that I left whatever I was doing at midnight to catch this fucking stupid bus which wasn't going to leave until nearly 2AM anyway.  They also don't run this service on Friday nights.  Or any other night for that matter.  Which is just inconsistent and annoying.My favorite T story:  I was riding home from Central Square to Brookline and instead of taking my ordinary route (#1 bus) I took the red line to avoid the possibility of missing my transfer.  Luckily for me, the last C was waiting at Park St and I was like ""Yeahhh going homeee!""  Well, we got to Kenmore, they ejected everybody from the train, claimed ""out of service,"" and drove off.  Another T did not come for OVER AN HOUR.  Not another C, another T.  PERIOD.  If I were smart, I would have split the cab with a bunch of people going to Washington Square, but I was stubborn (I'd paid my fare, the T should take me home, why spend the extra $$?) so I ended up taking the B because it was the first train I saw and I didn't trust that there would be a C or D coming, and walked 30 minutes at 2AM from the B line to my house.  I didn't get home til 2:30AM and had checked my clock in Central Square at 12:15AM right before I left.  I could have walked home faster!  This was not the only time it took me two hours to get from point A to point B because of the T, but it was definitely the worst.  (And I must note that this does not count the amount of times my ""stop requests"" have been blatantly ignored or I've been left out in the cold with arms full of groceries/whatever because the bus / T has chosen not to stop at its stop, JUST missed a bus that does not show up for an additional HOUR, I've been late for school/work/everything because of unannounced and unpredicted detours or construction or shuttle buses, so on and so forth... the list goes on.)Ugh, just thinking about the time the T has stolen from my life!  It makes me hate the world."
363,1 star rating,"Dec 17, 2010",Truly lacks the wisdom that you would expect with such age. It seems that its administrators never bother to understand why their customer's think so little of the T. Their mapping system should be upgraded to one standard instead of the mix of horizontal (in-train) and vertical (in-station) orientations. They can't blame the tourists for being clueless when the system directories are so disorganized.The buses are another story: What's the point of having clocks on the bus when the operators often run early and late for no apparent reason?

The green line trains that are super-slow and often late used to bother me, but lately, it has to do with the bus system.

So far there has only been one day in July (out of 17) where neither inbound or outbound train were late. It's too hot, too cold, signal problems, switch problems, conductor problems, engineer problems, something different every day.Commuter trains can only be boarded at certain doors. That's the most idiotic setup I've ever seen. It takes longer to exit and board a train at a busy station then with a Boeing 737. The doors are typically dependent on how many and where conductors are, so the passengers are left to guess. There is often a ""get to the open door"" stampede on the platform. Number of cars and configuration of cars changes day to day for the same train for no apparent reason.The only ""known good"" door is at the platforms which enable level entry. The platforms are Back Bay and South Stations are as far away from the station entrance as possible so everyone who actually needs the platform (disabled, strollers, heavy luggage) must walk the whole length of the platform. To make matters worse, the train often misses the platform, so the whole crowd needs to shuffle off the platform and climb in through the stairs anyway. The Trains technically have WIFI but it almost never works. Commuter trains have almost no signage and require ""insider knowledge"". There isn't a single sign anywhere at the Back Bay station platform. No schedule, no train indicator, no message board not even a clock. NOTHING. There only a bunch of bull horns that garble unintelligible messages. Apparently the first car after the engine is a ""quiet car"" but again there is absolutely no sign indicating that this is the case and what it actually means.Last week a friend of mine had to get to the airport and since it was during rush I recommended the train to South Station + Silver Line. Bad choice: there is no place to store even a regular sized carry on bag. The train had a problem a, stopped prematurely at Yawkey and all passengers got booted off with no help and/or further instructions on how to continue from there. My friend was lucky enough to find a friendly local to help him on his way but he didn't get on his flight anyway.It's not all bad though: the trains are clean and in reasonably good shape. Seating  is tight but workable, although sometimes the train is so full that there is only standing room. The conductors tend to be friendly and nice. It's also very expensive. My commute  of 22 miles one way costs ca. $21 round trip. 10 pass cost exactly 10 times as much."
368,2 star rating,"Apr 20, 2007","How can I complain about public transportation that saves me the hassle of driving in this town, saves me from spending my discretionary income on taxis (so affordable in Chicago, but not in Boston), and thus helps preserve our environment?  In my informal, unscientific study of the T, I find that 80% of the time I am *just* missing the C line.  So I take the D line instead, which seems to run more cars, which is great but some idiot conductor stops short at the Longwood stop.  This makes the second car run over the wooden boards that were laid between the tracks so us paying users can walk from one side to the other.  This usually happens when I'm on the wrong side of the track so I have to hurdle over the rails.  Thanks.  I also love this female conductor for screaming at me when I use the back doors to enter.  A) I just had to hurdle over the tracks thanks to your poor spacial judgment.  B) In all the years I've taken the D line, there is something called Show and Go! C) You don't have to be a raving banshee.  I'll swipe my frakkin' Charlie Card when I get it out of my bag.  I can't grab my lovely card AND hurdle at the same time.  That's just my morning commute.  The afternoon commute usually consists of just missing the C or E at North Station, and having to wait 15-20 minutes, sometimes 30 min. if there's something wrong with the tracks, etc.  Or I just about make it to the door, and wham, they slam it shut in your face.  Don't tell me that this never happened to you.  If it's not happening to me, I'm watching it happen to you.  It's like the conductors live to do this."

371,1 star rating,"Apr 21, 2014","Worth 1/2 star.Worst subway system ever !!Expensive: 11 Bucks for 1 day unlimited ride ! And $18 for 7 days.So when you stay for 2 or 3 days like i did you feel quite stupid.I have been using the subway in NYC for months and it is by far such a smarter and more efficient network. Boston should get inspired by it.Moreover you have to step a few stairs in norder to get from the platform to the subway floor. Another way to loose precious space in rush hours.Also for outdoor station you will have to queue so everyone can vadlidate its ticket at the SIngle machine near the driver. Just like in bus you will tellme, except that here, it is a mass transportztion vehicle.After loosing space, the mbta this is a good lesson on how loose time stupidly. It feel like you are riding the subway a few decades ago.Another important point, the govermznt center station. This station is closed and will be that way for 2 years. But no f***ing signs tell you that, neither on the platform or in the train. You will just have to wait until the last moment, when the driver tell you it won't stop there.With such an under-developed and not reliable system, I understand why so many people use their cars in this town.Well done mtba !!"

It is however clean, safe, and convenient for us with no car and little money for a cab.  I wish it hadn't increased to $1.25 because digging for that extra quarter is a hassle, but it's still cheap.  Wish it didn't shut down between 1 and 5am.  It's clearly not the NY subway, but it works.  A major overhaul would cost millions and millions... maybe one day."

374,2 star rating,"Dec 7, 2007","I was spoiled big time when I lived in Paris. While no public transit system is going to be 100% on time and without issues, the Metro definitely kicks the MBTA's inefficient ass all over the place.Unlike the Metro, the T doesn't have many access points. So, its difficult to live in a lot of areas in the city without having to walk 3 miles or resort to buying a car. If you are lucky enough to live near a station, that's great - but with all the weird 'technical difficulties' that the T seems to have on a daily basis, I sometimes wonder whether it would take me less time to walk from Cambridge to Downtown Boston. I'll be fair though - the Red Line isn't too bad. It holds a lot of  people, tends to show up more often than never, and is way faster than the pitiful Green Line. But you have to wonder what is going on when it suddenly stops dead in the middle of a tunnel for no apparent reason. Sometimes you'll get on a train with a driver who isn't half stoned, so they'll make an announcement to let you know what's up. That doesn't happen too often though. So, most of the time, you just sit there (or stand there) for what seems like an eternity, wondering if you'll ever see the light of day again.I have to say though...the reason why this review gets only two stars is because of the Green Line. Seriously, if I could give, like negative 10 stars, this is what I would give it to. The Green Line is slow, seems to show up randomly, and doesn't hold many passengers. You should see the chaos that ensues during the morning commute at Park Street. The young, spry Red Line keeps coming into the station, letting out loads of zombie-like commuters, who all trek right up to the Green Line platform. A lot of times, they will join the throng of other zombie-like commuters who are already there - still waiting for at least one..one single train to show up. Its amazing how long you can wait there...the minutes go by languidly, which makes the crowd swell even more. When a train finally rolls in, the stampede commences and nothing is safe any longer. At this point, come to terms with the fact that it will take you even longer to get to work, because now you have to wait for everyone to pack into the train, leave the station, and then go to the next station, where even more people will try to pack in (while others try to leave the train - a very difficult thing to do on such mornings.)Don't even get me started on the section of the Green Line where the train has to stop at intersections. Helloooo.....can we say BUS?! I thought that this was supposed to be a subway system?!Anyway, if you can, try to just take the Red Line - maybe forget about most of Boston entirely and just come and hang out in Cambridge. It's a great place to be - cute restaurants, bars, etc. Not only that, there is some chance that you might actually get there in time to meet up with your friends. If you insist on trekking a couple miles over the river though, make sure to give yourself like two hours to get there. With the Green Line as your mode of transport, you'll need it."

With parking in Boston so ridiculously expensive, $11-16 dollars a day, you have no choice but deal with there BS... which wouldn't be so bad, if they actually at least made it LOOK like they cared or are working out the kinks but they make it seem like pushing a button to make a train go and announcing a stop is sooo tiring. Not to mention when they act like they're doing YOU a favor when they bother to announce whats going on with a broken down car instead of just letting you sit there for 15-20 minutes without saying anything like they usually do.

379,1 star rating,"Mar 15, 2016","I wish that yelp would allow people to put a zero star review, because I would gladly do so. The MBTA is one of the most, if not the most, terribly organized and managed organization that I have ever seen. I really cannot comprehend how they are almost bankrupt, considering that they are running 20 year old buses, 35+ year old trains, pay their employees about 60k a year, and just raised the fare to $2.80. It is ridiculous. Another big issue is the safety of these trains; just a few weeks ago, TWO Orange Line trains began smoking, and people began to break windows and jump out to avoid suffocation. There has not been a single day, in my 3 years of riding the T, that there has not been a delay on one of the 4 subway/trolley lines. The old trains that they keep running (because they are ""out of money""), are always breaking down, and the stations are not well maintained. Remember those smoking trains I was talking about? Well, that was because a metal panel fell of the side of a train, and shorted out the third rail and the electronics in the train, causing it to smoke. Then, after the first train smoked out the station, it left, and nobody decided to turn off the third rail and remove the panel. I bet you can guess what happened next; yet ANOTHER train came into the station, and the train and third rail shorted out. The employees are lazy, over-payed, and think they are entitled, just because they are the ones getting you from point A to point B, even if that involves inhaling smoke for 5 minutes straight. Don't even get me started about the buses. Just today, the bus was supposed to leave Alewife Station (where the route begins) at 3:30, and it didn't come until 3:50. At around 3:32, two buses had ""79"" on the front of the bus, ready to take passengers. One of the two bus drivers changed his sign to say ""Out of Service"" and drove off. The other bus driver decided it would be a fine idea to just pull the bus over, turn it off, get out, and enjoy her coffee break. To wrap things up after this long review; if you plan on moving to Boston, and taking the MBTA daily, say goodbye to your wallet, lungs, and brain cells, because all of them will be gone after a few months."

It gets hefty for me riding the T into boston, because I live in the suburbs, and going into the city from Newton, I pay $3.00. The commuter rail gets you to Boston faster than the T...coming back outbound taking the commuter rail, you should ask and make sure that you're getting on the right one. I've gotten on the wrong one a bunch of times, and its really inconvenient, because the commuter rail doesn't run that often.

Even Hell probably has better transport systems than this city. One time, I was going to the Museum of Science via the green line. I wasn't really going though, because I had to wait for over an hour at one station to go two stops. At the next stop, they said ""this train is going out of service."" People on the train said ""They're not actually going to kick us off right?"" Through years of ""riding"" the MBTA, I knew that it would be their mission to make sure everybody left the train, even though we were all going one stop ahead. I then sat in the leaking, dirty, crumbling station for another 15 mins, and then a train went right through the station. People were flagging it down, but little did they know, the MBTA doesn't serve anybody. After another half-hour of waiting, the train finally came and what should have taken 10 mins ended up taking over 2 hours. We missed the iMax at the museum. I'm glad they're raising the fares!"

391,1 star rating,"Aug 4, 2014","The MBTA is the worst public transportation system I have ever experienced. I have lived, spent significant time in or visited New York, D.C., San Francisco, Chicago, London, Paris, Madrid and Barcelona. Your trains are old and antiquated, worn out, leaky, rusted and loud just for starters. The fact is this is the only subway system that does not run trains at 2 minute intervals during rush hour. 7 - 10 minute splits results in overloaded trains, long lines and daily frustration. In London, trains run every minute at Oxford Circus, a major hub.  This is only city where I see people running to trains every day, pushing and shoving, being told repeatedly by frustrated drivers to clear the platform.  It is your poorly run system that causes bad behavior among riders.  Barcelona's trains are large, and fast. People can stand 4 across between the seats.  I went from Central Barcelona to the suburbs in under 25 minutes.  It takes 45 minutes to an hour to get to Downtown Crossing from Wellington, 5 miles, and I often have to wait for a second or third train. It's the same on the return trip.  This should be a 20 minute ride at worst.   It takes 17 minutes in New York from 137th to 59th on the One Line, 5.3 miles. The New York trains run according to schedule. I have no idea when MTBA trains run. It's different every day.  This system needs new trains in addition to new stations. More stations will just clog the system more.  Whoever is in charge of city planning is a moron.  A 15-year old using Sim City as a guide could design a more efficient system.  The Chamber of Commerce should stop attempting to portray Boston as a major city until it can transport its citizens like other true major cities.  BTW-The Green and Silver lines are trolleys, not subway trains. In San Diego, the trolley takes you from downtown to San Ysidro in 45 minutes.  It would take at least 2 hours to go the same distance on the Green Line.  And the price just went up $5 a month.   This is what the New York MTA is doing: http://web.mta.info/capital/. Where is our money going?"
392,3 star rating,"Aug 19, 2014","With all the engineering and scientific talent within a 95-mile radius (Harvard, MIT, Wentworth, the UMass campuses, etc.), you would THINK that the MBTA would be the MOST efficient, MOST technically-advanced transit system in the country, if not the world. Instead, the whole system,but especially the Green Line, Silver Line and Commuter Rail WREAK of a ""Is this really the best we can do?!"" stench. Let's talk briefly about these three biggest stinkers:a) Green LineA recent ""Trains Magazine"" article about modern streetcar systems in this country (July, 2014) didn't even mention the MBTA's Green Line because, guess what, no part of it is MODERN. So, you say, ""Fair enough--as America's first subway it has a lot of old charm,"" except that that's not the case EITHER. If you look at San Fran's or New Orleans's streetcar/trolley networks you get the old charm feeling--the Green Line just kind of EXISTS. It's not like the MBTA even TRIED to keep ANY of the charm either:*Wherease NYC Transit takes PRIDE in the original mosaic artwork and tiling at many underground stations, the T walled OVER them with bland white walls.*Park Street had the most charming, yes charming, green lampshades on the Green Line level--they replaced them with ugly ""office style"" fluorescent lighting.*The T does very little to hype the Mattapan ""High Speed"" Line, the Red Line's extension from Ashmont to Mattapan. This best-kept-secret utilizes the old PCC cars which also ran on the Green Line through the mid-1980s.b) Silver LineIf you looked up ""bustitution"" in the dictionary, next to it should be a picture of a Silver Line bus, for the Silver Line continues the MBTA's long tradition of convincing inner-city residents that replacing fast, truly ""rapid"" rail transit with an effing bus somehow makes things ""more"" efficient:*A-train, which split off from the B at Packard's Corner and ran to Watertown Square, scrapped for the 57 bus. *E-train semi-permanently truncated from Arborway/Forest Hills to Heath Street for the 39 bus. When the traffic is bad they short-turn the trains even further up the line at Brigham Circle. It's not like the 39 buses don't ALSO get stuck in traffic so why not offer people a one-seat-ride out of JP?*The Washington Street Elevated Orange Line was scrapped for the 49 bus, which became the Washington Street Silver Line. This was after years of promising some of the lowest-income residents in the City in Lower Roxbury that it would be a light rail line (trolley/streetcar) line. Numerous environmental and transit watchdog groups have derided the so-called ""Bus Rapid Transit"" Silver Line as being one of the worst such implementations of BRT in the WORLD!*Forget linking two major rapid transit lines, the Red and Blue--instead let's use what little money that came from the Big Dig that was earmarked for public transit to build a brand new tunnel for buses to run through it at 10 mph and change power mode halfway to the Airport.c) The Commuter Rail, a-k-a ""Purple Line."" Where. Do. I. Start? I've ranted and raved on numerous blogs, including my own about how, the Commuter Rail needs to start, yes start, to electrify. I've heard every excuse in the book; and I have an answer for them all:*What's the point?Electric trains are faster, quieter and much more environmentally-friendly. Back Bay Station in particular should be the SHAME of the entire system, with dozens of locomotives belching diesel into the station throughout the day.*Who's going to maintain the equipment since the MBTA facilities have no overhead wiring? Really? That's like 5th grade mentality. BUILD the facilities!Certainly $500 million could've gone a long way towards building electric maintenance bays, with enough change left over to start electrifying at least the Fairmount Line, rather than blow it on reopening the Greenbush Line--which wasn't even PROJECTED to bring in a decent passenger volume.*Where's the equipment going to come from?This speaks volumes about the MBTA's procurement process in general--why does the MBTA need brand new ANYTHING?! For the most cash-strapped public transit agency in the country, why not take ""certfied pre-owned"" equipment from Metro-North and NJ Transit, give it a mid-life overhaul and run it for another 20 years. SURELY that make more sense than running what you've got INTO THE GROUND, causing numerous delays and the infamous double-trains. Oh, wait, because the MBTA tries to compete with the Joneses and buy brand new cars all the while still using old, diesel-belching locomotives. You're right, MBTA, people want brand new, shiny cars--not locomotives that won't start or go but then stall out. I had to laugh when, with the orders for the new locomotives falling behind, the MBTA was forced to lease used-but-very-functional ones from MARC. Throw some old Metro-North M-4s and M-6s on the Providence Line and start electrifying the rest of the syste"
393,3 star rating,"May 17, 2013","Ah, finally, my review of the MBTA! It's kind of one of those things that you think about for days, weeks even--what do I even start with? What to focus most of my attention on? Is this even worth it? But here goes . . .I've been riding the MBTA, the ""T,"" for over three decades. I just feel the need to throw that out there to distinguish myself from the transplants who have that ""one bad ride"" and want to flame the entire system. You know what--nobody and nothing is perfect. I've ridden every mode of the MBTA extensively except the Ferry--I'm not basing this review off of one bad ride on the ""B"" Line.#1 PUBLIC TRANSIT IS PUBLIC TRANSIT (IN THE U.S.A.)Public transit in the U.S. stinks. That's a fact. Metaphorically speaking it's a constant tug-of-war between Conservative-leaning politicians (and their constituents) who see little to no value in it other than ""another wasteful Government program to help the poor"" and Liberal-leaning politicians who see little to no value in it other than to pander to their constituents who value it for one or more of the following:*Environmentally-friendly*Sanity-saving over sitting in traffic (in a personal vehicle)*Avoiding exorbitant parking fees at their destination*Moving a car and losing a parking space (especially after a snowstorm)Thus, when Transit System X tries to make improvements, you get Conservative politicians who staunchly oppose as little as a $0.005 (yes 1/2-cent) tax increase to help cover it; and when the Liberal politicians push it through, only about 1/3 of if actually gets funneled toward improvements (the remainder goes to pay down various debt). Thus, the MBTA, like most other transit systems in this country, comes up broke every year, and every other year gets forced to raise fares even though raising fares doesn't account for even HALF of revenue stream. Sound familiar?#2 THE MBTA SQUANDERS WHAT LITTLE MONEY IT DOES HAVESo that little bit of money that comes from taxes and tax increases that actually DOES make it to the MBTA--where does it go?! I think what confounds me, and others who've lived in the Greater Boston Area long enough, is that the T is one of the LEAST expansionary systems in the country, and, what little money it did have for expansions in the last 20 years (after the Red Line Extensions to the North and South) got funneled into A. the Greenbush Commuter Rail Line, which nobody wanted and, even worse, created more congestion at an already-congested South Station,and B. the Silver Line, part of which was the greatest lie ever told in the City (should've been light rail vehicle service), and the rest of which only served to compete with bus service it was already providing to South Boston and transit service already being provided to the Airport (Logan Express).Meanwhile, beneficial projects have been pushed back numerous times or haven't even left the drawing board.*The Green Line Extension into Somerville/Medford was supposed to have been COMPLETED in 2008--no wait, 2014--no wait 2019 . . .*The Blue Line Extension to Lynn--still in ""proposal"" phase.*The Red Line-Blue Line Connector--still in ""nice to have"" phase.#3 CUSTOMER SERVICEThe bus and train operators certainly could take a chill pill: not only are they some of the highest paid people in the state without ever needing a college degree, their pay scale is WAY above that for most public transit employees in this COUNTRY--and that's even adjusted for cost-of-living! Add in being  part of the Carmen's Union--arguably one of the most iron-clad organizations since the Teamsters--and it certainly is a recipe for apathy towards the riding public.Part of the problem is that the MBTA relies almost solely on a lottery system (let's be honest, there's always some *hush hush* grandfathering-in--but we won't talk about that!) to hire bus and train operators. Sure, everyone gets a fair shot, but, wouldn't it be nice if SOME of the hiring was done of people who come from similar jobs who left in good standing?Let's say Bus Operator A  worked at Peter Pan/Trailways/Greyhound for ten years and got tired of the long, boring drives: Boston--NYC, Boston--Concord, NH, etc. Bus Operator A leaves with an exemplary record and is just looking for a change of scenery. That bus operator would be great for the MBTA! But, because of the lottery, Bus Operator A is competing with Pond Scum who dropped out of high school and just got his/her GED.  Sure, Pond Scum needs a job too--but, let's be real--there are people who take jobs because they even REMOTELY love what they're doing and there are people who take jobs because the Carmen's Union negotiated RIDICULOUSLY high salaries and generous pension plans for doing the same sit-in-traffic (cry me a river) job done by MILLIONS of people worldwide. You know what you wind up with when the  T hires Pond Scum? You wind up with the bus operator who took out a car trying to run down a ""meter maid"" because of her personal unpaid tickets."

Now the escalator inside the station between the 1st and 3d floor is out of service and has been for months.  Additionally one of the two elevators inside the station is out of order.  In MBTA terms this is a relatively new facility.  It is a disgrace that it is allowed to deteriorate.  Has the agency lost site of its mission - to provide reliable public transportation to the community -  a mission which management and employees should be proud?  Where's the leadership on this?

I watched them lose over 20 customers while I was standing there(not good business). Every time I take the T I am reminded why I ride a bike. Its never on time and everyone you talk to seems like they would rather stab you than take you 2 minutes down the line. Why pay to stand around and be late?

Also the T loves buses over subway/streetcars.. there are so many grown over short train routes such as Lynn to Wellington via Saugus. This right of way would make a good bus rapid transit.. not the bus rapid transit on Washington st in South End to Dudley.. if that silver line was on a former train right of way, yes it would be good but not on the street.. insult to those people who once had the elevated train. In the 70's the T was all about orange/red expansion and now since they have taken the train system over from the private companys such as Boston and Maine they rather care about 100 train riders, bring back Bud cars to carry so few people."

There was only 1 clerk at the service desks (5 were empty).Other MBTA personnel started to come in about 20 minutes into may wait and in that time joked around, drank their beverages, cleaned their counters, played with their computers BUT not one of them helped anyone in line. After 30 minutes I had to get back to work. With nothing accomplished.The wait at the old windows (right next to the NEW Charlie Card Store) only took up to 10 minutes EVER in those lines.

399,1 star rating,"Nov 20, 2014","There is often something wrong with the train, there are usually delays of some sort. There is no expectation of any sort of consistent bus/train schedule. The 32 bus from Forest Hills station has been especially vexing. When I get there in the afternoon, there are lots of kids who just got out of school trying to get on the bus. It's always crowded, even if I wait for the next bus. Today, two empty buses passed right by. Others waiting have said they've complained to the MBTA, to no avail. The 32 seriously needs to run more frequently or start using double-decker buses because this is ridiculous. It is a waste of people's time. And in a city like Boston, public transportation is cheaper and is supposed to be more convenient than driving one's own car. The entire public transportation system needs to be more efficient. In addition, it needs to be easier to purchase Charlie cards that work. There are a limited number of retail locations where cards can be purchased.  Charlie tickets are easier to get, but the turnstiles don't read them well--or at all. The machine takes a Charlie ticket in and out several times trying to read it, and sometimes doesn't work even though there is a sufficient balance on it. You need to fix those machines. I could go on about how inefficient everything is, but I'm too tired. -One very dissatisfied customer."

Although, the MBTA can be dirty at times and sometimes require a really long wait to get into a train, but overall, I think that as long as i get to the places i need to go to then i'm fine. There are air conditioning during the hot summers, which makes it somewhat more enjoyable when taking the mbta. However,  the fare increase lately so i'll think twice before taking the train again. Overall, i think we could use some new trains or at least a renovation here and there."

Most of the time it's not bad with regard to staying on schedule but my real gripe is with the drivers.  I've joked with friends that the first question on the application for bus driver is ""Who do you hate more, yourself or all of humanity?""  Just the other night, a driver shut the door in a woman's face and drove away.  This morning, the woman driving the bus sat at a stop for almost three minutes waiting for a passenger to find her wallet while others with passes waited patiently to get on the bus instead of getting everyone on and continuing on the route.  So of course I missed my connection.  I'm constantly surprised at how miserable the bus drivers are."

It's simple, straightforward and had stops everywhere I needed to go. The one day pass for $9.00 was perfect for me to get around wherever I needed to go. I was only in Boston for one day but it was less crowded during rush hour than it was in New York or DC at least. I will admit the trains themselves are complete trash.

418,3 star rating,"Jul 1, 2006","i've done some thinking about this and i finally decided to yelp my true feelings for the mbta. i've become carfree in 2006 (using zipcar, my bike, the T, and my feet to get around) so i've had to take mbta more often than i did before, to places i would've driven to before (i.e. to brighton or to the suburbs like waltham or newton from where i live in somerville). and yes, it totally is a mixed bag. shit is broken half the time, buses don't arrive, you're waiting for the T forever, the bullshit new ""an outbound train is now arriving"" announcement (uhm, try an actually useful system like the MUNI or BART ""a pittsburg/bay point train is arriving in 5 minutes..."" system), fare hikes, etc. BUT the fact of the matter is that i CAN get there from here. for instance, there's a bus that goes from cambridge to brighton so i can get where i need to go. yes, it only runs once an hour on the weekends, but there still is that option. same goes for the 'burbs...i was going to a friend's barbecue in waltham and there was a bus i could take - it didn't run that often but there still WAS a bus. get the picture? if you're willing to have patience and work with the system and allot yourself a LOT of time to get where you need to be, the mbta gets the job done. in some cities there just aren't buses or trains that go from point A to point B and the mbta system is expansive, if not reliable. the T is also randomly awesome sometimes - like when you're walking to the hynes stop and there's randomly a number 1 bus there, which you can take straight down mass ave to harvard square in half the time it would take you to go inbound on the green line and then outbound on the red. or the commuter rail, which you can ride with your subway pass within zone 1a. my boyfriend works in the north end and instead of having to deal with red to green (or orange) crap, he just takes the commuter rail one stop from porter to north station and his commute is cut down from an hour to like 15 minutes. a big beef i have with the system though is the whole bikes on Ts thing. i called the other day to inquire about what buses have bike racks on them since i wanted to bring my bike with me to where i was going, and the woman on the phone had no idea what i was talking about, and had to ask her supervisor..who then told me that the only buses that had racks were crosstown buses and those ""used to have them, like a couple years ago"". uh, hello?? shouldn't you be INCREASING the number of bike racks to reduce the number of cars on the road instead of DECREASING them? also, we desparately need the proposed ""urban ring"" to cut through all of the lines. going inbound just to have to go back outbound is damn stupid. it would cut down on a lot of the congestion on the green line (which is only really bearable during the summers when the college students aren't here)."

I live in South Boston, so, the T from here can get me to another bus to where I may be going.I've only encountered 2 really disrespectful bus drivers in over 45 years.The last time was just a few weeks ago.  I was on Bus #73 from Harvard on Sunday, March 24, between 12 and 1 pm. It was my first time on that bus.  I had no idea that folks tap their Charlie cards upon exiting the bus.  I was the first one on the bus, so, I tapped mine when I got on.  After a few stops outside of Harvard, I noticed that people were just getting on and a few who got off, tapped getting off.  When I first got on, I asked the driver about a certain street just before Belmont and he said ""g'head, just sit down, g'head"".  So, I sat down and when I saw the street coming up, I rang to get off.  When I was getting off, I told the bus driver I didn't know that the passengers tapped their cards getting off, and, I had tapped mine getting on and he said ""Just get off, keep going, get off"".  I was the only passenger at that time.I still cannot get over his rudeness.  I thought maybe it was a bad day for him, but, it was really a bittersweet day for me for where I was headed and I just could not excuse him.  He was a jerk and later on, I remembered seeing him in action on another line where he humiliated a young man until the guy got off of the bus swearing...then, he threatened to call the police.  He antagonized the kid.   It was totally uncalled for.This and, another time are the only times that a bus driver was rude and condescending and sarcastic and surly and disrespectful and unkind for no reason whatsoever only that I didn't know that you paid getting off of the 73 bus."

If they cancel service you don't get to have your money back as a refund, on a bus and subway and the commuter rail and boat, if you buy a pass that's good for all services. That's if you can't use your monthly  commuter rail zone 8 pass do to suspended services for many days, then that's taking money for no reason, that's not right, if they don't refund your money for a cancelled or suspended service for many days, that really hurts and it isn't fair period.If companies think customers should come first that they serve. Then they should give you a refund for like a monthly pass , if you were not able to use the pass for many days due to bad wreather, suspended services, that's the way it should be, a refund is really important. Since the MBTA dosen't give out refunds due to distrupted cancelled services or suspended services for many days, then it's not customers come first period. No refunds anymore is really bad unfair customer service, when transit service is cancelled or suspended for many days, even if you have a monthly pass and can't  use it, that's not right at all, that's not fair period. It's like you paid for cancelled or suspended rides. They don't have to treat customers that way. What happend to? You have the right to be heard, as a customer bill of right's as an apology and to give you a refund or a free ride ticket hello? Seems like customer bill of right's don't serve riders anymore, that's terrible. A customer bill of right's is stll needed ok, thank you MBTA."

I've lived outside Boston my entire life and over the years...I've seen the quality of all the lines plummet. Whoever manages the T should be fired. Every single one of the executive people. I bet those truly in charge pocket half the budget that is already much too low. No matter how early I leave to get to work...I always end up delayed or late. Its total BS. the green line is a joke. The RED line that is better is still delayed all the time. The Orange line looks like it's from the 50s and runs very inconsistently. They recently spent all this money to ""refurbish"" the green line. For one. None of those ever run on the B. We still get the short end of the stick. But nonetheless. Slapping on some paint and new lights is not going to fix the severe track and electrical malfunctions of this old and decrepit system. The T and Boston transport/road system in general is deteriorating. Just angers me how much we pay in this state and city yet none seems to be going to the transport"
424,1 star rating,"Jul 6, 2011","The absolute worst, most lame, ignorant, disorganized, disrespectful, financially irresponsible, poorly managed, over worked, under maintained public transit ""system"" the city of Boston could ever have.  Being one of the most cutting edge, sophisticated, hi-tech cities in the country, you would think that the bus and train system would not only make sense, but also work on a reliable schedule.  But of course not! In classic ""Old Boston""/Blue-blood/""Old-money"" fashion, cronyism and pathetic customer service win out over all.  The so called ""General Manager"", recently promoted Richard Davey is a world-class moron who for a moment impressed me with some personal correspondence about system-wide improvements, but quickly lost any respect after much expected lack of further communication.  I personally have used the ""Write to the Top"" form so many times, gotten SO MANY ""confirmation numbers"", and haven't received ONE follow up as they promise.  I keep reading news articles about how the MBTA is becoming less and less responsible for keeping schedules, maintaining good customer relations and other basic functions that one would come to expect from public transit organizations.  So basically, as time goes on, there will be less penalties for late service, passenger bypasses, breakdowns, out-of-service vehicles and a plethora of other nuisances we'll face without any hope for improvement.  So it's likely while I'm writing this review, that thousands of people are waiting in the blistering heat for a late bus, train, trolley or ride.  the MBTA is so ridiculously terrible at everything it makes me so angry.  Hopefully we here in the Yelp community can speak loud enough to our government and have them step in, kick a$$ and take names.  This pathetic company they call the MBTA needs a serious regime change, and lord knows they ain't gonna do it any time soon on their own.  Come on people! Let's get Richard Davey and the rest of those overpaid a-holes out of their positions and into the ""real world"" so they can see the crap they are were in charge of, and experience all the shoddy service that comes with riding the MBTA.  I'm glad MBTA is on the top 10 worst list, but it should be number ONE not 8!"
