3,"Oct 2, 2023","Bart is convenient but not intuitive. The lines/ colors/ names are confusing to newbies. I just had the conductor yell at a passenger that there are no boks on the first car. Yeah, I get that. But why would they put a bart car indicating that it could accommodate bikes at the front of a line of cars? Silly..."
1,"Aug 3, 2023","I'm sorry guys..... You failed in a most embarrassing way!!!What is up with your clipper card and it's masters degree to navigate when your kiosks are closed and you are underground with NO WI-FI!! Come on San Francisco........ this is embarrassing One of my favorite cities FAILS MAJORLY in its green effort compared to New York, Chicago, London, Italy, and even France (sorry France)Clean it up and make it more user friendly!!!!!! You made me get to the airport 25 minutes later than I expected!!Signed, Disgruntled in the City......"
2,"Jul 27, 2023","I know what crack smells like--not by choice. It's a bitter, acrid smell. Why do I know this? Because I've been around so many people smoking crack on BART and frankly, I'm not a fan! Can you get second hand crack? I sincerely hope not.BART is a decent option to get you to downtown centers and key neighborhoods around the Bay Area but holy hell somebody needs to clean it up! The needles, crack, violence and occasional indecent exposure are enough for me to avoid BART unless it's absolutely the best option. Parking in the city can be rough and sometimes nobody wants to give me a ride to the airport, so Im not gonna front like I don't hop on the occasional BART train and like it's not increasing access to travel in the bay. I'm just saying, it would be nice for it to be less nasty.Another issue is that BART could run a smidge later so those going out and drinking can use it to get home after the bars close. Overall, it's relatively reliable since you can track when the trains are arriving via Google maps and can plan your trip accordingly."

1,"Nov 7, 2023",Can someone please tell me wtf is that horrible smell that always comes in that tunnel right before West Oakland
4,"Feb 5, 2023",Bart in General is a great way to get around the Bay Area. With the introduction of Clipper on Apple Watch I no longer have to get my Wallet out in order to pay my fares. I simply double tap the side button on my watch and select Clipper. Wave my watch at the touch pad and the fare gates open. Makes it easy for travel.The bad is that there is a lot of people cheating the fare gate system. For example at Hayward BART when I exited in the handicap section of the station someone took advantage of the open gate and walked through. And at Bayfair when I used the elevator to enter the station because I don't fare well on some escalators someone took advantage of the open gate and left the station without paying. So BART is really not enforcing these fare cheaters while the fares continue to increase gradually. The attendants at the stations seem to not care. The only way the crackdowns happen is when actual BART police is at the station.When I visited San Diego and used the Trolley Service there were active fare inspectors on every ride I was on to make sure people paid and if they did not have a valid fare they had to vacate the paid area. Bart could learn a lot from them if they invested in active fare inspectors.

3,"Jan 3, 2023","There is no greater way to keep tabs on the pulse of a nation than by riding its public transportation, and let me just say, the United States appears to be doing very, very well. I know there are those out there who are, for one snobbish reason or another, hesitant to take such modes of travel. In light of this troubling attitude, I am willing to help BART appeal to this potential client base by putting a positive spin on a few of the less initially... attractive aspects of their service I encountered during a recent trip. Now, was the interior of the train covered with a wide variety of debris, including (but not limited to) socks, hypodermic needles, and a half-eaten chapstick? Yes, but this can easily be reframed. Rather than advertising their trains as ""filthy,"" BART can say that each car is ""a mobile community art project, filled with emotion and creative urban collaging.""Did the car smell like it housed twenty-five feral cats suffering simultaneously from rabies, mange, and food poisoning? Yes, but this can be repackaged as ""bringing the sights and smells of San Francisco with you as you go."" Were half of the seat cushions inexplicably ripped off their chairs, leaving rusty springs exposed? Sure - ""Each car has been redecorated in its own original way to keep with the changing times."" The man behind me who flailed around wildly and ate things off the floor and then attempted to smoke a crackpipe mere inches behind my head? ""You're almost always bound to meet a local guide with intriguing recommendations.""The complete lack of security presence or anything that would make a rider feel even remotely safe in these conditions? ""Ride in complete freedom, without fear of a tyrannical authority figure ruining your evening's fun."" Yes, BART is a lovely way to travel - just bring Lysol and weapons."
3,"Nov 18, 2022","I judge a city's public transportation chiefly on whether it gets me where I need to go. I can't say that's the case for BART, or frankly, any means of transit that doesn't operate 24/7. People need to travel after midnight, whether they're out on the town or headed to/from work. When that isn't an option, it creates problems. For me, this meant a difficult time getting from my hotel to the airport. For others, I'm sure they're more significant & can't always be solved by calling a cab.Trains aren't well maintained or especially secure, often with garbage & unhoused &/or mentally unstable types making riders feel unsafe."
1,"Jul 29, 2023","As a visitor, I found Bart a combination of confusing, broken, and expensive. The transit card purchased at the airport doesn't work elsewhere, which is not communicated anywhere. The card dispensing machines are mostly broken but not labeled as such. Our visa credit cards didn't work. We could only purchase 5 cards on our ATM cards but have a party of 6. There are so many modes that I cannot navigate how to get around. The clipper app requires that I provide my phone number and address. Why is they needed to ride a bus? What an unnecessary intrusion. I won't use it.I've travelled a lot, and this was a relatively stressful and difficult transit experience."
1,"Dec 1, 2022","Wow, I can't believe some of the BART stations do not take credit cards, only cash or debit.  I heard they are upgrading their ticket machines.  So many people don't carry much cash anymore.  Besides being expensive and nasty, why wasn't the machines updated 20 years ago."
1,"Nov 16, 2021","Since the Covid pandemic, Bart riders are scarce.  I was taking BART to the Powell Street station.  This BART station  is homeless central...dirty, crazy homeless people on drugs. Not all entrances has escalators, be prepared to go up or down lots of stairs. The signage was not working so could not determine which train was approaching. Fares prices keep going up, yet the cars are filthy and not sanitized.  Some of the cars are 40 years old.  Time to upgrade to all new cars and get rid of the old cars."
2,"Feb 13, 2017","I am an occasional BART rider and usually a rider on weekends.  Sundays are the worse as there are no direct trains to San Francisco from Berkeley. It can take up to an hour from Berkeley to downtown San Francisco, so you have to plan accordingly.  With all the people riding BART, it makes no sense why there are no direct routes.  Trains are dirty, smells like urine.  Most times, even on weekends, there are no seats available.  However expensive this system is, people take BART because they are the only convenient public transportation available from the East Bay."
4,"Jan 24, 2023","I braved BART today! Not bad! I was preparing to take pictures to add to my friends ""Bart Angst"" file.... But to my relief... I found none. I rode a long way from Ashby to SFO during morning rush so there were a lot of opportunities. I had a seat! The car didn't smell bad...nor good. There were no delays! And people filed on and off without any riffraff.BART deserves a better rap... And it needs new seats with wipe-able, indestructible, recycled plastic fabric!And it needs the ironed on gum and detritus   scraped off the floor! And a good window cleaning! Would be a 5 Star true mass transit for all! Hey... Maybe the decommissioned old cars could be used as free health clinics on Bart grounds and  homes for those in need too? Just saying... Let's BART again!"
1,"Jul 10, 2023","BART is one of the worst transit systems.  All the reviews about dirtiness, out dated cars, riders jumping the fare gates not paying are all true and the sad part of it all is that BART does not really care what the condition of their transit system is.  First the cleanliness of stations and trains -- People who clean stations and train cars are mostly part-time employees that BART does not budget for, so they spend a bunch of money hiring part-time employees who may stay for 90 days or less so you never have a steady amount of cleaning personnel.  Plus the way they clean is disgusting.  The mop that is used to clean the floor is the same mop used to clean the escalator handles.  Lastly, the elevators staying clean is the responsibility of the patrons to advise the station agent of the dirtiness so a janitor can clean it.  Actual signs are posted in the elevator alerting riders of this.Out Date Cars -- The cars are out dated, but don't worry they have those fancy new cars, but unfortunately, by the time all of those cars are on the rails the technology will be out dated.  The same technology BART thinks is so amazing on their new cars has been on cars in the NY subway system for years before BART rolled out the ""Fleet of the Future""....only question is at what point in the future?Checking Fares -- BART spent a bunch of money on individuals to check passengers to see if they paid their fare.  The only problem the amount they hired in comparison to the number of trains that are on during any part of the day resulting in this to be a useless program.  If they were serious about the fare issue they could have a conductor like trains such as Amtrak such have that go through the car and check tickets.  This one individual, or at least two individuals could easily go through the entire train for an entire shift checking fare payment.  Problem solved.Internal Culture -- The culture inside the organization promotes individuals who have no qualifications to be in positions they are in, or set qualifications that will exclude well qualified people from applying.  Sadly, some individuals are so arrogant in the organization is that they actually tell people who work under them that there is no reason for them to apply for a position because I am going to get it.  They call this professionalism...hardly.Overall, BART is not a good resource to use either as a tourist or a commuter.  As one reviewer said you are better off getting a rental car."
1,"Jul 1, 2023","So dirty, trash everywhere, needles, poop, unsafe, something totally out of control. Beside that, it's very expensive for that low quality. Also....the train cars are so old and out of date...."
1,"Sep 7, 2023","want lips kisses lips...butt kisses butt? Ridiculously, they've changed all trains to 6 carts only even during peak hours. dont even think of getting a seat and have a luxurious ride. Fare jumpers continue to jump the gate with no consequences. Druggers...homeless dirtying all the trains. Only punishing the working class  and taxpayers to pay for all the scumbags."
1,"Jan 25, 2023",Updating on how Bart is lately. 99% of the time they are running on 8 car train even during peak time. So its crowed and all packed together when trains are running late. Most crowed especially around 5pm on weekdays. Sometimes even cancelling out a train. Been taking Bart for the past 10 years and seems like service is going downhill. Drug addicts and homeless are down at Civic Center station hanging out daily.
1,"Jun 2, 2022","Horrible, disappointed and disgusting. Its peak hrs and always cancelled every other trains on the Berryessa line both AM and PM. Also shorten from a 10 cars train to 9 cars. Felt like bunch of sardines packed in a can. Catch COVID sooner or later.  Stairs are disguesting with pee smell. Bay Area Shit Transit."
3,"Sep 29, 2022","It gets you where you need to go.  Security has increased. Trains are cleaner than before. New trains provide more support for standing -- less seating, but it's a reasonable compromise. Seats are better. Sound filtering is better than before. Customer service is relatively prompt, but needs improvement on friendliness and attention to customer concern. Escalator directions could use consistency. Preferably they would go up at all times. Station cleanliness needs drastic improvement."
1,"Jun 21, 2023",Not reliable whatsoever. Buy/rent a car. If you are forced to use it just know that there will be delays and you could get robbed. Welcome to the bay sorry we dont have decent transit and sadly BART holds us back from ever getting any
1,"Mar 26, 2023","I was atta today by a black man who actually works for Bart. he punched me in the face , tried to still my phone and broke my glasses. my office is near Civic Ctr. station so it's really crazy there. people shooting up, vomiting , urinating, defecating  , etc. complete madness on BART. Fare evadees every where and there's no poli to be seen. Bart has no future if they don't address these issue."
1,"Dec 29, 2022","Why people hate BART...1. You don't feel safe. 2. Not clean. You are afraid to have a seat even on the new cars. Every car has a strong urine odor. 3. Homeless people are in every car.4. People are disrespectful, yell, cuss, play loud music, smell, smoke, etc.5. Poor communication if there are delays.6. Half the riders hop on free and no one cares.7. Employees don't get paid enough to care.8. BART police are unseen, sit back, wait for something to happen, and respond later. 9. Security cameras... do they even work? 10. It is dated.  Everything from the old train cars to the robotic announcements need an upgrade. If BART wants a bailout and a measure on the ballot... no thank you.Shame on you, BART! SHAME! Take some notes from Vancouver's public transportation. Canada does it right. Or not. Keep doing what you are doing."
1,"Feb 20, 2023","Awful, awful service. I mean there is never a day without out something going wrong. Chronically late. Poor scheduling of trains even during rush hours. If its after 7pm the average wait time nearly doubles to 30/40min waits usually longer due to late trains. ""Rapid"" is wildly misleading. Trains rarely move a full speed. A 30min drive on bart will be over an hour of travel time. And the ticket disperse and old and rarely work correctly. Missed a train due to malfunctioning during payment. Avoid using it as much as possible. I know I will be."
1,"Oct 12, 2023","Honestly I can now see one of the reasons Bart's ridership is down. It's too damned hard to get a ticket to ride it. My phone that is four years old is too new it says for me to be able to use App. I could buy a clipper card but in order to do that there is a $3.00 fee which is waived if you allow for deduction monthly from your account. I can find no place to tell me how to add rides to card, or if the $3.00 is a monthly fee. Also in their contract they state they share your info and are not responsible for their content. They say I can use Google wallet, but I don't need one more way to access money or give another corporation my account data. Bart itself has a separate website you can't buy tickets from. Too much technology has ruined the ease of things. More access to my bank account is not better. My info sold to third parties because I just want to go for a ride is not better. I guess I won't be riding bart. :)"
1,"Dec 13, 2022",BART lost my commuting ridership for two reasons:1) It's insulting and infuriating to me that basically every fifth person just jumps over the gates for free and no one cares. I'm paying full price and the free riders act like it's their right.2) The majority of the free riders are vagrant drug attics. The do their drugs in the train often smoking something that smell synthetic that eve permeates your mask. They leave their garbage in the train. A lot are also mentally unstable and make the train unsafe. Some may scoff but this is reality!I would propose that Bart does a pilot program to install New York like gates that go all the way up. Test this at a pilot station then install more. Until the two points I listed above are addressed I would rather pay more to park than ride Bart. It's sad because I know Bart has a budget deficit and decreased ridership. But the Bay Area needs Bart!
1,"Dec 12, 2022","It is so vile and disgusting being on the train. The train reeked of cigarettes and the next car reeked of pot. Homeless and their gear all over the place. Food and drink containers all over the floor in multiple cars. Food and candy on the ultra dirty seats, above a dirty sticky floor. Covid would be scared of this monstrosity, and leave the train. A ripped seat  on the floor. The foul smell bad body order.  Dirty clothes on the floor with no owner in sight.  Then a few people jump the exit without paying. BART should be disgusted with itself."
3,"Jun 9, 2022","I recently took BART for the first time since the 1970's when it opened to get from SFO to Berkeley. It was so efficient and I am so grateful that it exists. However, it was not the best experience people-wise and that is not so much a reflection of BART as it is of the times.A crack addict rode near me and scratched, genuflected and spewed some kind of dander all over the place while panhandlers sauntered about asking for handouts. An armed policeman walked through many minutes after this had all occurred. That is a 1-star review experience, my friends. The elevator and grounds were sketchy and kinda gross."
3,"Jan 18, 2023","Took the train to the Oakland Airport from North Concord on a Sunday.Ride was good until I transferred to the Coliseum. Glad I don't do this often.I did take BART back home two weeks later.  It wasn't any better, but on a positive note, the senior clipper pass is a good deal!"
2,"Oct 18, 2021","Public transportation is dear to my heart.New hours since August 2021 as we emerge frompandemic: WD: 5am-MN                    Sat: 8am-MN                    Sun: 8am-9pmOne star deducted in comparison to DC Metrofor safety, cleanliness, lack of airport surchargeand promotion of color designation of various lines. Kudos for Clipper Card."
1,"Jul 11, 2023","Don't I wish I could use public transportation but by all means, it doesn't work for me. The location in question - Berryessa San Jose. Once again, there are no Zeros or negative numbers in the Star options. The ""brief"" version:It took me almost 5 minutes to find a ticket machine for parking to pay, more out of orders than working ones, finally I made it - too bad I missed the first train. I have a Clipper account, charged with $30 (months ago), have the Clipper App downloaded and it confirms the $30 on the card, using an Android phone with NFC and I thought I am ready to go. Well, the card reader that did not have the ""out of order"" sticker did not cooperate. It was very persistent telling me please touch card again. So, it recognized there was a card - my phone with NFC - but it refused to let me into the station. After many attempts at all possible entrances, I pressed the ""help button"". The recommendation was to call Clipper, they are responsible :( I called and they told me, the Clipper App is not what I need, I need Google wallet to get in. Okay, I downloaded Google wallet and sure enough the Clipper card showed up with a $30 amount, isn't life wonderful :) Unfortunately the next train just left the station. Here we go, convinced the stupid Clipper system finally lets me in - WRONG - same message, please touch card again at all possible scanners I found. At the main entrance I found a lady from BART, explained my situation and what I tried, she apologized profoundly and recommended to buy a new plastic Clipper card, charging it with another amount to use it. Most of the Clipper machines where out of order and the one working did not offer a ""buy Clipper card"" option. She tried to use my phone as well to get in, no such luck. The whole user / customer / passenger (not really) experience was worse than ever before when it was much easier to buy a ticket for a single ride. The next train was gone by now and after about 40 minutes utterly frustrated, I decided to skip my trip to SFO as I was in such a bad mood, nothing positive was to be expected.What I did not mention, this was the second time with a very similar experience, the first time I had to drive to Oakland airport to pick up my daughter instead of taking BART. Maybe I was just an outlier, but I need to make sure that there is a record of the overall miserable customer experience at this location. Don't think that BART is a viable alternative for people like myself using the (well trying to use) the transit system every now and them.I am a big fan of public transportation, if it works, like it does in other countries, but I do understand if people in the Bay Area consider it a waste of money subsidizing BART.Just close it down and provide free UBER or LYFT, probably cheaper and for sure more reliable."

1,"Apr 20, 2022","Train is functioning. Worn out and dirty seats. Dirty window sills. Not exactly the kind of train I expect to ride in in one of the most expensive cities to live in the US or the world probably. I guess when it is the only transportation option you have, people will eventually get used to it."
1,"Sep 2, 2018","This update is about two months overdue. On July 1, 2018, at approximately 3:10 PM, I boarded the Dublin Pleasanton BART train at the Fruitvale Station with destination to the last stop in Pleasanton for the Alameda County Fair.Much to my disgust when I entered one of the cars, I could not sit in a certain section. I had to walk down to the other end of the car while the train was moving to find an available clean seat. What I saw was atrocious and the first thought that ran through my mind was why are they not doing maintenance inspection on these cars? Why even put this car in service when the seats are heavily damaged? I don't consider the condition these seats are in a safe one for passengers."
1,"Oct 17, 2013","I have to agree with the other two yelpers in giving a one star for the strike.  Shame on the people on both sides of the fence that they can't come to some sort of resolution/agreement on this dispute.  I feel for the people who have to rely on BART as their source of commuting to and from work.  For me, it's a different story.Ever since BART went on strike back in July, I had the good fortune to find another form of transportation for commuting to and from work - the San Francisco Ferry leaving from the Alameda Main Terminal.  I vowed never to return to riding BART, but I had to do so at least 5 times due to convenience.  The ferry boat ride cost me more, but to have a bar and restroom facility on board and then not worry too much about potential thievery of laptops and smartphones by some passengers who were scumbags, suited me fine.Now, the different story between the passengers relying on BART and myself is I stopped commuting to and from work since October 1.  I'm on a second journey in my life, and BART is not in the picture."
1,"Jul 29, 2022","Bart is the WORST transit system I have ever been on. I've been on several others and it's sad how terrible Bart is. It's dirty, never on time, stops randomly for what seems like no reason, stops are cancelled, the people who work at Bart are rude as hell. I've avoided Bart for years but decided to give it another shot since we're going to a baseball game and it's supposed to be the most convenient way to get there... and it's taken over 2 hours to go on a route that should take 1 hour a 4 minutes and we're not even there yet. Honestly I would rather walk the 30 miles than be subjected to this slow-moving petrie dish. Bart sucks."
4,"Mar 14, 2018","Hey, It's BART!  Better than renting a car, paying tolls and parking, gas, etc.  It's cheaper, less stressful, and easy to use.  Cost is relative considering how expensive it is to drive in SF and find parking (nearly impossible or excessively expensive)Went from Oakland Airport/Coliseum to SF Powell St. costing $21.90 round trip (Yes $10.95 each way).  If you're flying, BUY the round trip ticket as the price will NOT change.BART has a tram that comes & goes to the airport and the Coliseum Station.  From that Station, you can catch the trains to any location in any direction (Fremont, Richmond, Pittsburg, San Francisco, SFO).Quiet ride today compared to other times because the trains operate on steel rails and wheel so at 70mph through the Bay Area tunnel can get VERY loud."

In San Francisco, the BART (and MUNI) seems cleaner and safter and more efficient.The prices seem a tad high to go to places like Fremont where it's like $7 each way or $14 round trip, but I guess you save on gas, bridge toll and time (not being in traffic).It's a fairly easy system to use and is self explanatory for newbies and out of town tourists visiting SF.I'd not say it's the best system nor luxurious, but does the job well I think."
2,"Aug 14, 2022",BART's weekend service is becoming consistently bad. Transfer timings are 50/50 the other train already left or not. Long long waits between trains and trains move very slow between some stations.
4,"Sep 10, 2021","1st, can anyone actually hear what the driver ever says over the intercom? Please update your system do that we can understand what is being said. Second, how often are the trains cleaned? Really? If there are videos in the trains, maybe you can try a way of pointing people out that are loud, behave inappropriately. There was a young lady on the bart and she was very, very loud, playing music very loud. I turned around because I did know if she was being hurt, but no she was just being annoying. I enjoy the bart, happy that it is doing good things for the environment too."
1,"Dec 26, 2021","We've been away from the Bay Area for two years. Before we left, I would have said that BART was a substandard subway system that was an embarrassment to the large and affluent Bay Area, primarily due to its limited schedule (it closes every night), its infrequent trains (with many lines only running every twenty minutes), its somewhat high prices (especially for longer trips or just crossing the Bay), and its overcrowded trains (especially during rush hour). I've ridden a number of other public transit systems in large, metropolitan areas, and BART is bottom of the barrel. But it used to be relatively safe and functional (though I was finding delays growing increasingly common at the time we abandoned the Bay Area, which I don't know if that's still the case or not today).Two years later, by which I mean two COVID years later, BART has become a horrific cesspool. Taking a long ride, from the south end of the line (in San Jose) to the northeasternmost stop in Oakland we encountered:(1) At least half-a-dozen homeless people, a number of them looking mentally impaired in some way. At least one of them wearing no shoes. This is an escalation of a problem a few years ago, when BART stopped policing homeless people from getting on trains and riding them as far as they wanted. They were often dangerously aggressive, sometimes dangerously sick, and rarely pleasant. A few years ago, I'd often see one in any car I was on for more than a few stops. Now, as I said, it was a half-dozen on a fairly long trip.(2) At least half-a-dozen people either not wearing masks or wearing masks that did nothing to cover their mouth or chin. It was the three or four that just didn't even bother at all that shocking me the most: that they were ever allowed on the trains in the first place.(3) One young man absolutely screaming into his phone the whole time he was on the train. He was also unmasked and so covering the end of the train (fortunately, away from me) in spittle.(4) Another man getting on the train, starting to scream at another passenger, literally chasing him through the train car, and then as he returned to his seat saying how he was going to kill a white guy some day. He was unmasked too, as was the white guy he chased through the car (but did not kill).Traveling with my luggage, feeling vulnerable as a result, and definitely feeling vulnerable about COVID with the omnicron variant cutting through the population, this was all around a pretty horrific experience. And I'm an experienced BART rider from my previous decades in the Bay Area, not some country mouse. I'm not convinced BART should be running if this level of (non) safety is all they can provide."

5,"May 10, 2017","I have a fairly light carbon footprint. I think probably the greatest thing one can do when living a green lifestyle is to be vegan & consume a plant based diet. After that transport plays a big factor. I have been car-free now for 13 years. I have been living in the Bay Area now for just over a year & take BART into San Francisco from Oakland at least thrice a week if not more for work. It is a reliable form of transport to commute into the city from the town. I also love using BART to go into Berkeley & other parts of the Bay Area. Much of this time of living car-free I have primarily been a bicycle commuter. It has helped living in some of the best bicycle commuter friendly places in the nation such as Portland, Boulder, & Eugene. Since moving to the Bay Area I primarily commute by BART along w/ walking.I last owned a car when living in Los Angeles. Los Angeles is quite car centric & was built w/ the car in mind. It was built around the freeway. After living there a year back in the day & having to content w/ gridlock bumper to bumper traffic on the freeway I was happy to finally give up owning a car all together. Besides living a green lifestyle & helping the environment being car-free is also far less costly than owning a car. Think about insurance, upkeep, gasoline, parking, & more. Sure being car-free isn't for everyone. Some people need a car when living in the suburbs or in rural parts yet being car-free works for me. I can understand people w/ kids might also depend on a car for day to day life. Living in the city car-free works for me & is a lifestyle I enjoy living!For cities in the United States the Bay Area is often ranked second in best public transport trailing behind NYC. I was born in NYC & had my first job there when I was 15. While in NYC my preferred mode of transport was walking & taking the trains. I much prefer BART over the bus systems here as there is something about travel by train that is nice. While NYC might have a more efficient & less costly subway system the Bay Area has a better climate. There is no snow or ice to content w/ in the winter. The summers aren't hot & humid like NYC.The BART isn't a perfect system though & does have it's shadow side. Perhaps Sat & Sun could be as efficient as M-F & ditto for holidays. There is sometimes delays, sometimes construction, sometimes escalators are out of service. There isn't one set price like in NYC as rides cost by how far you travel.Still all in all having a Clipper card is the way to go & you can always top it up as you need. Sure it might get crowded at times & you might have to stand yet this is nothing compared to taking the Metro train in New Delhi, India where commuters are packed like Dolmas in a tin. All in all I love BART. Having entertainment on the train on occasion such as breakdancers or people busking performing live music at times is part of the fun like NYC subways in the day."

1,"Jul 7, 2018","BART, Bay Area Rapid Transit, should stand for Bloody Aggravating Repugnant Transit (or Fucking Annoying Rapid Transit), in my opinion.  It's AWFUL.  OK, I'm basing this on ONE experience, but it's enough for me to think, ""Never again!""The afternoon of July 1st, my partner and I flew into SFO, and being from Vancouver, we don't have ride sharing, so getting an Uber or Lyft from the airport wasn't a possibility (I've since signed up for a Lyft account and downloaded the app), and a cab would have been horrendously expensive, so we decided to take BART, an unwise decision.  First, there weren't enough BART ticket machines at the airport, despite there being more than enough space to install more, so there was a long lineup to purchase tickets.  Second, not all machines took cash, so we had to pay with our credit cards, thus paying high foreign currency exchange rates.  Third, there was no information on how much our ticket would be, but we didn't have the option of purchasing a ticket for less than $20 anyway (which, in Canadian dollars, with the credit card exchange rate, came to $27).And the trip itself was an absolute nightmare.  The trains were dirty and disgusting, and uncomfortably crowded.  Coming from the airport, we had a large suitcase, two bags, and a knapsack, so trying to exit the train was very difficult.  And as I was trying to make my way to the door, I accidentally brushed against a woman who made no effort to let people pass, despite saying, ""Excuse me"", and she flipped the fuck out on me. Yeah, pleasant ride. The price of our ticket turned out to be outrageous -- nearly $11!  Because we were two people, that's over $20 in transit fare, and because we each had to purchase a BART card with $20 on it, we actually paid $40 (or $54 Canadian with the extra currency exchange fee).  At that price, I would have preferred to pay extra for the comfort of a cab.  After all that, we now had two useless BART passes with over $20 worth of fare on them, which we were never going to use again because we were so disgusted with the experience.  (Thankfully we were able to give our cards to our friends, who use the BART.) There are some cities in which you can take transit from the airport, but like Berlin, San Francisco is not one of them.  This has been one of the worst airport transit trips I've taken, even worse than when I got punched in the face on the metro in Prague!  Getting punched in the face is better than taking BART from the airport.  And cheaper.[Yelp collections: West Coast 2018; Planes, Trains, and Automobiles]"
4,"Jul 1, 2016","For my 50th review, I have been thinking which business establishment should I do for this milestone of mine. And my 50th review coincided with my holiday in San Francisco, one of my fave cities outside of LA. I'm writing this while on board the BART train from Concord to Daly City. So my 50th review is now dedicated to none other than....BART! I can't think of anything more fitting.Just like the metro rail system in Chicago, I love taking this train going around NorCal. It's so convenient to just hop in to go from one place to another. The coaches are clean, air conditioned, not stinky and passengers are well behaved (based on my personal experiences). It's always on time and every station is well maintained as well. The price for one way at $6.30 is not bad at all considering how far you can go on a single trip. There's also daily and mostly pass options available based on your need. Seniors and students can also avail of discounted passes at $2.35 one way. The only thing that annoys me is not the actual train system itself, but some passengers who don't observe the big sign that says priority seating for seniors and persons with disabilities. It annoys me to see why people who deserves the seat are the ones standing up. Today, I have to give up my seat to a mom who has a little girl with her because no one is willing to. A simple kind of kindness won't hurt you people. And one more thing BART, as much as I love you, please keep the restrooms cleaner."
1,"May 17, 2018","If I could give Bart no stars I would!!!!! I absolutely hate Bart and I think Bart police, janitors and attendants are being paid for no reason!!!!

Just walk, rent a car, or ask a friend for a ride. Bart keeps raising prices but not showing what they need the money for or using the money to better the system. People steal phones and purses on these trains and beg for money. If I were you I wouldn't ride Bart!!!!"
3,"Dec 19, 2019","BART, or Bay Area Rapid Transit, began operations in the early 70s and almost seemed visionary, with its then modern '70s stations, free landscaped parking lots, turnstiles that went ""woosh"" in response to your magnetic strip fare card, Jetsonian looking rail cars, and smooth riding upholstered train cars with carpeting.  For many who live and lived in the Bay Area, it made everyday life a lot more convenient and commutes more feasible.  For out of towners, it made visiting the Bay Area more of a treat than it already was.BART is not perfect and so, on my last review, it got 4 stars.  Finally, BART has reached SFO ... for quite a while, actually.  It also has a people mover spur in the East Bay that can connect you to Oakland Airport (OAK) from the lines running up and down the east side of the bay.  Furthermore, BART has made some notable eastward expansions in the East Bay, out beyond San Ramon and Antioch (on 2 different lines).  They are also extending southward toward San Jose with the opening of the Warm Springs station, complete with all the new transit oriented development it has spurred, all set within sight of those typical oak studded brown hillsides of much of California.However, I feel that BART has slipped in many ways.  The first noticeable thing is how unkempt the rolling stock and many stations have become.  Now, instead of sampling a happier cross section of Bay Area denizens, you get to sample the more divided populace of the area, as in the haves and have nots.  In some cases, the theatrics in stations, at their entrances, and aboard the trains can go a little over the top.  While the Bay Area seems to be at the forefront of legislating and embracing so much special snowflake political correctness, you can't hold unhappy and unwell people to that yardstick.   I did get a quick look at some new rolling stock, which doesn't appear to have the trademark slanted back vehicle at its ends, as it was traveling on another track and it is much needed.  It's about time.Ticket prices are high, as are the prices for subway and train tickets in comparably priced New York City.  Each ticket price is dictated by the station pair, be it SFO to Oakland City Center or Richmond to Warm Springs.  Monthly travelers have some sort of loaded card that comes with integrated fare discounts, but point to point fares are still high.  Fares originating or ending at an airport must have a surcharge in them because they are much higher than if you began that same trip just one station away, and not in an airport.  However, it is much cheaper than taking a taxi or Uber/Lyft and much more ""direct"" than taking one of the big buses or coaches, such as SamTrans, to the airport.  With that said, BART does not have any sort of unlimited 1 day, 3 day, or weekly pass while the transit systems of many expensive U.S. cities do - I'm talking Los Angeles, Chicago, Miami, and Boston, to name a few.  Visitors to the area who want to be civic minded and use the system extensively get soaked in the process.BART is approaching 50 years of service and, while the more recently expanded segments of the service area aren't as worn, the original segments are starting to show a good deal of wear and tear.  I'm sure the overhead of running such a system, which was way ahead of any such system elsewhere in California, must be daunting.  However, with its inflows of funds, BART needs to keep the stations and trains cleaner and safer for what you pay.  But, it's to be expected.  Like most things in the Bay Area, they are never priced with much correlation to the value you receive.  BART may have 4 letters and once really merited its 4 stars.  However, it now just sort of ekes out 3 stars.  For those who give BART 1 star, and some of the experiences they describe point to why they are doing so, how would you feel about not having it at all?  And, since BART is behind the 8 ball in so many ways, I sort of feel that, even without penciling it out, those who oversee the system know they have a captive audience and could do better."
4,"Apr 29, 2013","BART was the coolest thing under the sun when it was newish.  BART = Bay Area Rapid Transit.  As kids, we used to ask each other what the Fresno area would call their system if they got rapid transit.  Hardy har-har.  Kids.BART made all the sense in the world.  The Bay Area very badly needed an alternative to connect riders from its East Bay counties of Alameda and Contra Costa to the city of San Francisco across the vast bay.  When newer, the trains were sleek and cool, but now look dated and scuffed up.  The front of the cars were raked back, unlike the traditional subway cars seen in New York or Chicago.  The interiors featured both cloth seats and carpeting. The stations were modern and the whooshing sound of your ticket going through the turnstile was kind of cool.Pros:  A sensible layout that has continued to serve more communities in the East Bay, it now goes into airport at SFO, there are plans to go into the South Bay (but only along the East Bay), a nice smooth comfortable ride and ideal climate control, and the harmless quirkiness of the Bay Area on display (and the stories that go with that).Cons:  expensive - a ride from some far flung location such as Pittsburg/Bay Point or Pleasanton into the San Francisco airport is $$$, it doesn't hug the side of the Oakland airport and auxiliary transit is needed to get into OAK, some trains need to be cleaned up, the South Bay extension won't go all the way into San Jose and it should, and most of all, the idiocy of San Mateo County is legendary - they didn't want it THEN so it doesn't go down toward San Jose on the Peninsula side of the bay.  Wouldn't BART have been WAY better than Caltrain, with its at-grade configuration and limited hours?If the South Bay extension along the East Bay and a theoretical San Mateo/Peninsula line existed, and both met at San Jose, and cars and stations were slightly modernized, BART would be perfect.Also, there is no cost-benefit to crossing over north into Marin County, since the population base is low and most people who live there have enough money to wipe their asses with, as in ""What, moi on a subway car?""Even if you are a tourist, a BART ride is cool.  You can either take it to the SFO airport or ride it to Berkeley on weekends when there is the open air market on Shattuck Avenue and the tie-dyed crowd stuck in some time warp is on display as much as the very crap they sell."
2,"Jun 21, 2018","BART would be so great if the management would focus on the quality of life issues and the basics.  The homeless crisis has spilled onto BART, most riders don't feel comfortable locked in a carriage with people that are in the midst of a crisis.  It's also an issue at the stations.  On a couple of occasions I left and took UBER because things were too crazy.  While on this topic, riders deserve clean carriages and facilities, but the homeless issue has destroyed order and cleanliness.See attached photo of a guy strung out on something (probably heroine) who was on when I boarded at Embarcadero and rode to SFO.  No BART enforcement to police this."

3,"Feb 22, 2016","When it comes to public transportation, I think BART is fine. It's functional, in many cases practical, and it gets you from Point A to Point B safely, affordably, and reliably. Sure, some of the stations aren't clean, the trains and buses can stink, and you have to deal with other people (the horror), but it's not any different from most other public transit systems around the world.BART's fare structure is different and more expensive than other public transit systems I'm familiar with in the U.S. Specifically, I'm talking about New York's MTA (Metropolitan Transportation Authority) and Atlanta's MARTA (Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority). Both MTA and MARTA charge a single flat rate per ride, $2.75 for MTA and $2.50 for MARTA. BART, on the other hand, charges based on distance. Instead of paying a simple, cheap, flat rate, BART riders have to calculate in advance how much their ride is going to cost.There are a couple ways I've calculated my BART fare:1. Use the fare calculator on BART's web site at https://www.bart.gov/tickets/calculator. Just enter your origin station and destination station and the web site will tell you how much the ride will cost.2. Use the fare schedule inside the train station. It's a large matrix of fares. Just match your origin station to your destination station to find your fare.A one-way ride on BART can cost as little as $1.95 (e.g. Montgomery St to Embarcadero) to as much as $12.05 (e.g. San Francisco International Airport to Pittsburgh/Bay Point). Yeah, it can get relatively expensive, but you're bypassing all the traffic in San Francisco, the Bay Bridge, and the East Bay, not to mention saving on gas money and tolls.Unlike other public transit systems, there is no charge to purchase a BART ticket. All you need to pay is your fare and the ticket kiosk will spit out a BART ticket with the amount you paid on it. For simplicity, I recommend using your credit card to purchase your BART ticket. Once you've swiped your credit card, you can add or subtract money onto your ticket in increments as little as $0.05. BART fares always end in multiples of $0.05, so be sure to add the correct amounts to your BART tickets so you never waste any money. (The New York MTA has collected over $500 million in unspent balances. http://www.yelp.com/biz/metropolitan-transportation-authority-new-york-4?hrid=QYfJhmXo1eViCW6Ahl9tYw)BART trains and buses see a lot of ridership and for good reason - gas is expensive in the Bay Area, traffic can really suck (especially on/around the Bay Bridge during rush hour), and parking in San Francisco can be expensive and/or difficult to find. The trains are worn and smelly, even the refurbished ones with the ""new"" vinyl-covered seats. At least they got rid of the cloth seats which were easier to stain, harder to clean, and retained odors for longer periods of time. I think they should convert all seating to a curved, easy-to-clean, hard surface.The trains and stations can get absolutely packed during rush hour. I've been on my fair share of rides across the bay during rush hour in both directions. Once, I took BART from the airport to Montgomery St station on a Monday evening at the peak of rush hour. There were so many people inside Montgomery St station, lined up for trains or entering/exiting trains, that it was basically impossible for me to physically get out of the station tugging my carry-on roller bag behind me. I had to lift the bag and hold it in front of me to squeeze by everyone, from the train platform all the way up the steps. It wasn't a big deal, but certainly an annoyance. So just be aware of that. In those instances, some people may find a more comfortable private ride (e.g. taxi, limousine or shuttle service, Uber, Lyft) worth it."
1,"Apr 13, 2022",Always running late. Do not take Bart in the morning for work I have been late everyday this week and have arrived to the Bart 2 hours prior to my shift. The trains going from east bay to SF are over crowded and late every morning. The sad part about it is Bart doesn't even update you if there going to be late or eta on how long you could just be sitting in a subway. Terrible communication. I've missed my cal train twice this week due to Bart.
1,"Jan 14, 2021","BART train delays resume again. Up to tonight, it has been nice, with low ridership during Covid, so essential workers like me can feel reasonably safe. In the 2.5 months of riding BART between S.F. and Milbrae, there have only been 3 people not wearing masks and 1 sick individual not properly wearing his mask. But it was not a big deal as the cars were almost empty except for 5-10 people.Tonight, the train sat 10 min. at a stop--it seemed that the trains stopped running for that duration as a ton of people piled on at the next 2 stops. The cars were so full that people were standing 1 foot apart. So much for social distancing during Covid!"
1,"Mar 7, 2022","I use it daily, but literally every day, you can expect major delays or cancelations lol. I wouldn't recommend Bart if you have cars."
1,"May 24, 2020","Am I the only that feels the need to take a shower after every time I ride the bart? Ok cool, didn't think so. The nauseating smell of sh*t and warm piss wafting through the air as it envelopes me and pierces my nose as I enter the bart for my morning commute is an experience that you will also have to endure if you so bravely choose to take Bart. Now that you've entered the train, it's time to take a seat, right? That easy, right? Hmm, well you look around for a seat... Homeless guy with his pants half down is sitting over in this corner. There's some moldy crusty food that's starting to take on a life form of its own in the crevices of this seat. Maybe I'll sit there? Naa, there's some unidentified liquid (probably piss) on the ground there. Ehh, I'll just stand (good exercise anyways). Hol' up, goddamn, it stank, though. When was the last time they cleaned this train? I'll move to another train, no biggie. I just gotta open 2 sets of doors. Good thing they both weigh like 170lbs to open. This train is much better, but f**kin hell. Why is this wannabe kid blasting his trash music for everyone to hear at 7:45am???Seriously, BART. Get. It. Together. Learn from the Japanese and their rail system. It's clean, fast, and efficient. Man, am I glad I got my own car and no longer have to ride the BART.And how the hell did the Berkeley Bart construction project take like 4-5 years??? Is there any accountability? What a waste of taxpayer money. I came to the bay in 2011 doe-eyed and full of optimism when I saw ads all over saying that Bart would be expand into the South Bay. It's now 2020, and I would be surprised if Bart made any more progress beyond Warm Springs before I died. Everyone needs to be fired and the bureaucracy needs to be trimmed down."
1,"Apr 24, 2019","When I first started riding BART in the 1970's it was great.  Pretty clean and well kept and a decent experience to ride.Over the years it's gotten more and more crowded, dirty, not well kept up, and definitely not a joy to ride.Worst of all are the great number of lowlifes, beggars, boom box clowns, and criminals who habituate the trains.  All this is due to the really terrible job that BART does in policing the trains."

BART has not yet addressed the many riders who don't wear masks, pull them down or take them off to eat.  ""BART Police will remind people"" is what I'm told be their reps. That strategy is not working and BART continues to encourage people to ride in unsafe and minimally monitored conditions."
1,"Jul 17, 2019","If you make it past the dead-eyed buskers with enough mental fortitude to ride, you're greeted by a dense, ominous odor wafting from the stairwells.  The deeper into San Francisco or Oakland your origin point, the more assaulting the approach. The stench is a flesh-melting mixture of dirt, mechanical oils, rotting food and bodily fluids, with just a hint of musk (likely from bodies packed together like sardines during rush hour). If this effluvium isn't enough to curdle the contents of your stomach (one reason I ride before meals), a riling game of ""Bop-It!"" with a tired ticket machine should do the trick!Good luck navigating the droning prompts on this monochromatic would-be slot machine, whose buttons are permanently caked with a mysteriously sticky film. The machine trills and chirps at you loudly with each button press, inching towards your desired ticket-amount in nickel increments only to spit out chunks of loose change in a guttural rattle, no matter the denomination you sunk into her hungry cash receiver. When you finally get your ticket  -a flimsy, magnetized piece of paper- you waddle over to the turnstiles, heavy from the change weighing down your swollen pockets. You wait in line for your turn to play Operation with the mechanized ticket receiver which, if you're lucky, will carry your precarious paper ticket through her internal levers and spit it out at the other end, admitting you into the station.  **DON'T FORGET YOUR TICKET**If you forget to grab your ticket, an exciting conversation with a slate-faced station agent to explain the lost ticket awaits. A conversation that will make a Pap-Smear or colonoscopy seem pleasant by comparison. When you reach the platform, your train has been characteristically delayed by some accident or malfunction. As your mind wanders, you fight back the ever-looming fear of getting trapped at the base of the trans-bay tube. You're saved when your train grinds into the station with a ground-shaking rumble, trailing a putrid gust of wind that thrashes your face. The train lets out a series of thunderous bellows (think fog horn meets elk's mating call) warning you off the neon yellow braille mats lining the platform, away from pulverizing train wheels and the much feared electric third rail. As her doors open, a wave of angry pedestrians trample towards you with straight, angry faces as the train operator rushes a garbled directive through the P.A. system. A new mixture of smells and sounds assault your senses as you weave your way onto the cacophonous car.  You brush past a sweaty vagrant, an over-cologned businessman, a morbidly obese woman eating yesterday's fish sandwich, a hooded figure cursing obscenities at the air, a group of loud teens swilling concealed alcohol from a soda bottle. You press yourself between two seemingly-innocuous riders to grip a grease-streaked steel bar for support and settle into the zesty toilet-bowl aroma.  For the duration of your ride, the train churns and screeches through the bowels of the city, snaking its way between dirty, halogen-lit station after station as you struggle to avoid direct eye contact. At last, you are belched out of the car at your final destination, paraded up the stairs by the anonymous mob of fellow-riders and set free."
5,"Apr 6, 2018","YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2018 - 91/100. So, I'm from SoCal, right?! And I gotta tell ya... public transportation where I live sucks so bad. How I wished we had something like BART to take us everywhere! We don't even have a train to take us directly to LAX! Someday... SOMEDAY, maybe!!! I love love LOVE the Bart system, though. It isn't perfect, but it's far better that what the greater general Los Angeles area has. And with public transportation allowance given by my office, EVEN BETTER. So, yeah. I'm a fan."
1,"May 11, 2019","I just used BART to get from the San Francisco airport to downtown San Francisco in the beginning of May 2019. BART is the WORST form of public transit I've ever taken. It's even worse than the bus and I hate buses. (I've taken the London Underground, Paris Metro, Beijing Subway, Washington DC Metro and they are all very easy to use and well run subway systems. And their cars don't screech.)When you ride on BART, you really need earplugs. The metal wheels and the tracks are obviously installed incorrectly and the sound inside the BART cars make an extremely loud screeching sound for the entire ride. This is wrong and all politicians and BART management should be ashamed of themselves. In fact, new politicians should be voted in to make the BART system a good subway system. Shame on all people who purchased the BART transit system and shame on all the politicians who are doing nothing to repair or replace the entire BART rail system with good mass transit rails and cars. All of the BART cars are old and disgusting looking. The seat covers are old and disgusting as well.I was in Beijing, China in 2010 and rode their underground mass transit system. It was extremely easy to figure out how to get from Point A to Point B. I know ZERO Chinese. The subway stations were beautiful, clean, and set up to help move a huge amount of people with ease and with the least amount of walking, from the street to the boarding point for the subway cars. The subway stations are extremely clean and welcoming for passengers. The subway doors are evenly spaced and throughout the entire car so it's easy and fast for lots of people to exit and enter each car. The subway cars are very fast and quiet. Inside each subway car, above each and every door, is a lighted map showing each stop. Plus the lighted signage shows which stops the subway cars have already stopped and which stops the subway car is going to. The subway lighted map system (inside the car and above EVERY door) has both Chinese characters and English underneath each stop, to make it easy to know where you want to get off the subway. San Francisco politicians and transit system people need to:1) Ride the BART system and ruin your ears and be ashamed of the transit system you have and then...2) Take a trip  go to Beijing, China and see how a real city runs a very clean, extremely fast, quiet, and easy to use subway system. 3) Then these politicians and transit management types should be tried for being incompetent, corrupt and lazy, and have them serve prison time. 4) New politicians need to be voted in and new transit management put in place, go to Beijing, learn from the Chinese. 5) Then have these competent management oversee a complete revamping of the BART system with new rails, new subway cars, renovate all subway stations including re-engineering the subway stations with too long of a walking distance from street to the subway car. New and easy to read and understand signage needs to be in all subway stations and inside all the subway cars. And for goodness sake, add the subway car name to the outside of the sides of all the subway cars, so when they arrive at a station, it's easy to confirm that that exact subway car is the one passengers want to take, and so that the signage on the outside of the subway car will match the boarding area signage on the inside of the subway station.And make sure that the new subway cars have lighted signage (a lighted map with all the stops for that subway line) inside and above each subway door (like they have in Beijing, China) to make it extremely easy for passengers to know when to leave the subway car.And the new subway cars should have evenly spaced out doors to allow easy access for people during rush hours. And if you are really clever, you'd have a permanent wall between the subway tracks and the boarding area in the subway station so people can't fall or jump in front of a subway car, like they have in Beijing, China. San Francisco, ever heard of safety first?6) Don't allow the homeless to reside in the subway stations. Have security guards at the entrance of every BART station and don't allow the homeless inside. Locals and travelers don't want to see homeless people sitting and begging them for money, don't want to hear the homeless yelling and screaming, smell the rancid orders from these homeless and don't want accosted by the homeless."
3,"Jun 25, 2015","Bart...older than I am.    I will start by saying that its very useful when travelling and especially going to ""Special"" events involving libations.    Now, the trains have a lot of issues and it's pretty often. In the winter time you're often likely to get on a train with its air conditioning on (which I don't mind as I love cold weather), but in the devils heat you are also likely to board a train with the heat on which is sickening. Whether it's a ""Medical"" emergency, police activity, or just some unknown delay...it happens a lot. The trains are pretty clean for the most part, but the employees can come across as unhappy and treat everyone the same. A paying passenger doesn't often look like a homeless person begging or trying to ride for free, but some Bart employees act like you simply don't matter whether you are polite or not.     I will share one of my experiences with a sad Bart agent...the clipper card was recently introduced and the Bart system was not fully prepared for clipper. My clipper card did not work at several of the gates so instead of holding up other passengers I went to ""See Agent"" as the machine instructed. I politely told the agent good morning and explained that I tried to use my clipper card and it would not work...the agent came out stating ""you just want me to work today..."" was serious and not joking with me. They got it to work after running it across the reader MANY times, and told me I just have to do it right next time. I thanked them kindly and went to work.    I have family that works for Bart and have gotten assistance with a smile from many Bart employees so they definitely deserve stars.Everyone knows Bart as a whole is a great asset to the Bay Area in general, but Bart can do better."

2,"Sep 14, 2015","Gets you where you want to go, most of the time.The tunnels can be uncomfortably loud for some passengers.The cars can be uncomfortably hot and humid from lack of ventilation.The signage of which station you're at is often hard to see, if visible at all, from within a car.The bart mobile app is often a minute (or more) behind, where it says 1 minute left when the train is actually pulling into the station.The trains are often delayed."
3,"Mar 24, 2015","Took the BART from the San Francisco Airport. First time riding the BART. It travels pretty fast. It took awhile to get to our destination which is Dublin. We had to find the one that goes to Dublin. It has different lines and destinations, so make sure you get on the right one. I did not care for the loud noise as we traveled. We went under a water tunnel and it literally popped my ears which hurt a little. I did not enjoy that. It did not seem to affect the normal people who ride the BART on a daily basis. The ride was fairly smooth and it got to our destination pretty fast. My husband bought prepaid cards for the BART. We just wave them in front of the scanner and it let us in and out. I think my husband loaded around $40 in the card which should be enough to get us back to the SF airport when we leave from our visit in Dublin. I do like how friendly the attendant was at the 12th St and Oakland stop. She helped me swipe my card on the machine because it was not working. She was very helpful. There were some strange characters on the BART as with any public transportation. I saw a guy haul in a shopping cart in the BART which was funny. Also saw a couple of guys dance for entertainment and then tried to collect money. I guess that it typical with any type of public transportation. It was an okay experience."
3,"Feb 6, 2018","It is what it is!For the most part the service is okay. The trains are mostly on time and kept ""cleanish"". The stations are as clean as you would expect.

4,"Jul 29, 2016","Entertainment Factor Sometimes Available On B.A.R.T.SITREPBay Area Regional Transit (BART) is the ""workhorse"" that gets people around the San Francisco & East Bay Areas.  It really as of yet does not have much of a footprint in the South Bay, though one line does extend to San Francisco International Airport (SFO) and another line terminates at Millbrae.THE SETUPMass Transit will always have it's issues.  It's a total crapshoot whether one bases transit on:* ""TIME"" - as Sacramento does with it's Light-Rail and Buses - you purchase the pass/ticket and you have a 2 HR window to travel within; or on, * ""DISTANCE"" - as BART does when calculating how much to deduct from the ticket as you exit from a particular station.BENEFITS I find it is much cheaper and less stressful to hit the rails (Amtrak AND BART) than deal with gas, the tolls, the traffic commute anxiety, law enforcement, wasted time, etc. etc., especially if I can leave Sacramento in the middle of the afternoon, do my thang in SF/Oakland, and return to Sacramento before Midnight / 1AM - then it's totally worth it to travel down Amtrak and catch BART.ENTERTAINMENT!And once in a while, you even get to see some impromptu shows by the local dudes who have their music and magic dance moves to keep people like me entertained.https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bart-oakland-2?select_video=d9J7e2uo-a0S0XMuw1CS-ATHE LOWDOWNIt certainly pays to travel by mass transit on some occasions."

Disappointed.The trip was ok and on time."
1,"Jan 16, 2017","Another year another one star review for BART. Happy New Year guys! Within the first 10 days of January, we've had one major morning disruption that resulted in a 2 hour delay and an evening disruption that paralyzed the system for over 5 hours due to a single fallen tree towards the end on the San Francisco line. Even on good days that have supposedly ""good"" service, the delays during morning commutes are 15-20 minutes. Typical pathetic attempt at service from BART."
1,"Nov 10, 2016","The average delay for BART during rush hour is now 30 minutes and 1 hour during off hours. I am currently on a platform in San Francisco at 9pm, and they just closed 1 of the only 2 tracks in and out of the station. 1 track for 4 different train lines.  Their incompetence is on a level that is criminal. As I have repeatedly said in the past BART must be sued at a class action level."
1,"Sep 28, 2016","A month after my previous review, no improvement whatsoever was made. Severe delays were experienced on average 5 days out of 5 on every work week. They are so poorly organised trains going to the exact same destination show up at the same station at exactly the same time! An issue you would think would affect buses more than trains, but BART manages the impossible. And not only do they not improve, they get increasingly worse when it comes to reliability. Trains get later and later throughout the week until they're showing up 5 minutes late, not including delays you will encounter further down the line. In most countries 30 seconds late is considered unacceptable but for BART, you should just be grateful BART employees bothered to show up for work, albeit in their unwashed and unkempt ""uniforms"".Conditions on BART trains themselves are dire as well. Over the past week there has been a heat wave in the Bay area. The heat inside the train cars generated from body heat from all the packed passengers along with the greenhouse heat from the lack of air conditioning made the trains very suffocating.Conditions in BART stations are horrendous. Besides the filth and the infrastructure from the 19th century. BART doesn't seem to have the concept of air filtration for the air in their stations. If you catch a glimpse of the station air through the rays of light during sunset, you will see just how thick with dust and who knows what the air is. It cannot possibly be safe to breath the air on BART. There is also very little police or security around BART stations and passengers are often harassed by individuals who are intoxicated, drunk, delusional, or being approached for money by ""street performers"". The number of delays resulting from ""criminal activity"" at stations prove my point. If you are reading this and you are a good lawyer, or know someone who is, please consider starting a class action lawsuit against BART or the BART workers union. They consistently failed to meet their schedule or provide the service thousands of people pay for everyday. That should be false advertising at the least and passengers should be refunded all their fares for the last year, if not more. Have someone measure their reliability scientifically of you must but this is a solid claim.Furthermore, lawsuits should also be filed in regards to the neglect they have made in regards to passengers' health and safety; whether it's the heavily polluted air (scientifically measurable) or the overheating and suffocating train cars (also easily measurable). This would make a long lawsuit but the claim base will be huge."
1,"Aug 30, 2016","It's official. BART is the most miserable excuse of public transport systems in the world. Don't really know where to start. For many people who commute to work everyday, and thanks to Bay Area traffic driving is not an option, they are forced into using BART. However, if you think the existence of BART solves the issue of Bay Area commuting, you'd be dead wrong.BART has a schedule that they list on every station, the kind of schedule legitimate public transport systems have; you may have seen schedules that resemble it in other countries or cities. It's a very rudimentary schedule, the kind even an ape would be able to follow. Yet it is all a cruel prank on its passengers. Simply put, if you plan to get to your destination by following the BART schedule, you will NEVER arrive on time. I can't recall a single day where trains where not delayed by some sort of excuse (mechanical failure, criminal activity, smoke in train, pants on fire, whatever). If it happens just once, it's an understandable mishap. But when it happens 4 out of 5 working days EVERY WEEK, then it's more down to the system and the people who run it. One has to wonder how many screw ups it takes to mess up a system where trains run from Point A to Point B on preplanned schedule on a closed track. And these jokes who called themselves BART employees still have the nerve to go on strike and ask for better wages.In short, if you need to get somewhere and have the option to use something other than BART, use that thing other than BART. But if you enjoy being stuck in dark tunnels for unknown amounts of time while being lied to about why you're being stuck in said dark tunnel and in the company of too many people with little to no air conditioning, BART has your back."
1,"May 15, 2016","Always late, unreliable, filthy cars and overpriced. Those are just a few civil words I can think of for the Bay Area Rapid Transit.BART is a joke of a public transportation system that is run on an antiquated system and ancient hardware by a group of employees who are lazy and self entitled. For an area known for technological advancement, BART is truly a disgrace to the area. To those of us who have lived in parts of the world with an actual public transportation system, there really is not even a single quality to BART. There is no system to speak of, trains just show up whenever conductors please, usually 3 to 4 minutes behind the published schedule - that is if they are ""on time"". More often than not, there are ""significant delays"" which literally happens on a daily basis. These ""significant delays"" would not be much of an issue if BART didn't run on a schedule that only has one train slithering by every 10 minutes. With the demand for public transportation the way it is, BART is already failing. Every single day during rush hour, people are left stranded on platforms, as train after train arrive and leave packed, usually 5 to 6 trains go by before they can find one to squeeze themselves onto. This is not the kind of service passengers should expect, especially with the current ticket prices. And with the demand increasing, there is no way BART, in the way it is run now, will possibly cope.A large part of BART's failure is down to its employees. There is too high of a reliance on a group of individuals who have extremely low standards when it comes to quality of service, and a very high level of entitlement when it comes to pay and benefits for their shoddy work. Strikes and complete shutdowns are pretty much expected every few months, and the entire Bay Area suffers because of these selfish individuals.At a time when the population of the Bay Area is increasing every month, radical change is much needed for BART. Huge investments in its infrastructure is needed to create a transportation system that can actually sustain the increased traffic in the Bay Area. As the centre for technological advancement, BART should be moving away from its reliance on manpower and towards autonomy. The vast majority of the functions performed by its employees can be replaced by autonomous systems, which will perform better and complain less.It is a real shame that in an area as great as the Bay Area, transportation is a choice between hours stuck in traffic, and a unreliable, disgusting relic that has no business operating in this century."
3,"Jul 20, 2016","Public transportation in the Bay Area is really pathetic. The big tech company buses are great for workers,but further exacerbate the traffic congestion and inequality. Limited service at few locations are bad enough,but the complete lack of trains going through the Bay Area loop hurt everyone. For all the innovation happening here, the industry is complacent about this problem. The government agencies such as BART are also to blame. I really want to take public transportation to avoid hellish traffic and to be environmentally friendly. However, the system makes this nearly impossible to accomplish unless one has 2-3 hours to waste each direction."

The guy ahead of me stopped and turned away and says there is a ""gauntlet"". I looked up and stairs are blocked by drug dealers, someone sitting down with bags, then a guy upset I didn't use the other half of the stairs (I left the wider path to a guy going up with crutches)At this point I just feel bad for BART and think maybe they have thrown in the towel during COVID (even though this experience is not too different than pre-corona). But! their Twitter page is full of recent fake PR posts. The banner shows the most fictional clean platform and spotless train at West Oakland.I am a lifelong public transit guy but man this is out of control.One start because the new cars are quieter.

For $4.20, BART will get me to Oracle Arena in 6 stops and 22 mins. With rush hour, I probably would still be fighting traffic to get onto the Bay Bridge.Granted, BART is not the most reliable at times. And once something holds up the trains at a main station, all the lines get delayed. But I can't hate on public transport. I just wish they only had 10 car trains during commute hours as trains get packed after work.There is definitely room for improvement, but I'm glad we have BART."
2,"May 20, 2019","I depended on BART when I visited the area, and I have plenty of positive things to say about the system. It goes between the airport to the downtown area and across the bay quite directly, and the convergence of lines around the city center makes it easy to get a train there. The light rail (I'm just reviewing the whole transit system) goes straight to the baseball stadium, but nowhere near the Golden Gate bridge (i.e. the thing you came to SF for). There's also this weird mix of light rail and underground going on where the same train will go in and out of tunnels; a streetcar becomes a subway and then goes back again. I found it easy to get a card at the airport, and the costs have not been bad. The trains don't run frequently enough at off hours, and everything is on the dated side.Yelp reviews aren't really the place for social commentary, but without making any statement on the details of San Fransisco politics and policy (because I don't know enough), I can only say that whatever they are doing for the city's homeless population is not working. I was greeted on my first train by someone loudly threatening to kill whoever they were talking on the phone with, and subsequently encountered several more people who were clearly struggling in life. The police were reasonably caring in handling a homeless gentleman with an apparent case of cellulitis who troubled the passengers with his behavior, but no one stopped a passenger from drinking root beer laced with whiskey out of a can. DC's public transit system, where I'm from, is superficially similar, but it is literally a news story every time someone gets caught with food or drink on a train. This sort of behavior is not normal in any city I've visited on either side of the world, but it is the stereotype that all of us non-locals think of when they think of San Francisco, and the stereotype appears to be true. Given how filthy rich the city is, you'd think they could do better at taking care of their transit system and their people."

Believing that it was just because of BART being unsteady, I ignored it. As the train continued on and we were arriving at the Montgomery Station, I felt another step on my foot, but this time it felt intentional.I turned around to see who might have accidentally stepped on me, to which it appeared to be the same woman who told me to turn down my music.

I told her that because BART is so loud, I couldn't hear/understand how loud my music might have been and that if she had that much of an issue with my music volume, she could/should of, moved to a different area of the train.As we stopped at the Montgomery Station, she proceeded to shout out loud so that the whole train would pay attention, that she ""asked"" me if I could turn my music down. However, this was false. I simply reminded her that, ""you didn't ask me anything, you demanded. But you could have asked politely."" As the BART doors opened and everyone was exiting, I got a handful of praises /acknowledgments from other by-standers who witnessed everything that took place (thanks yall).I say all this to say that the lack of human to human contact through verbally present communication, is lost. I'm a native to the Bay Area and the lack of humanity here is becoming extinct. All I'm saying is just be more mindful/kind to people and communicate to others how you'd want to be communicated to in return. And to that ""BART employee"" who felt so very entitled, take a chill pill... You're supposed to be a representation of BART as a company instead of keeping up with the stigma of failure.P.S., I just bought some BEAT headphones :)"
1,"Nov 20, 2021","Inserted the Barf ticket into Bart machine and it kept it. No agent at booth and late night. So I entered and explained when I got to my stop. Then they wanted me to pay twice and one person started yelling at me to pull my mask up so I said they should do the same as that person wore it like a chin strap. Then a police came with the usual and after a few mins of bad vibes said it was all my fault. He also said I was lying to him which is typical nonsense. I did nothing to deserve such nasty treatment. Avoid Bart. It's nasty anyways and also unsafe (lice and bedbugs). Barf agents also will demand your ticket and tell you that your ticket didn't have enough $$ on it as the machines are worn out and covered with duct tape and pressure you for some cash. The Barf agents act excited,angry and talk fast and loud. Just remember that you are responsible for your own safety. Bart has never been and never will be safe. What really upset the Barf agents is asking them why I should  pay twice. Let's ask Brandon!"

Plan for cushion time if you need to take a flight departing SF airport. I don't think it was any worse than other major rail systems I have been on in other big cities.  However, I am downgrading the stars to average since timeliness is a major factor into good transportation."
1,"May 16, 2018",After parking at Richmond BART Station for nine months my car was hit and ran punch and vandalized and then tagged with spray paint my car was totaled. Bart Police never showed up to take to report because there was another incident in Berkeley and they apparently only have three officers. The Richmond BART station has problems with the transientAnd juvenile delinquent's hanging out smoking weed in the elevators hanging out in the parking structure stairway and vandalizing cars while people are at work or at school trying to make a living. I just want to get the word out there and prevent anybody else from going through what I went through. There's a sense of lawlessness that occurs there please be where I would park somewhere else far away

The train that I rode from Powell Street station was clean and quiet. It wasn't rush hour, so there was plenty of seating. The train was well lit and I felt secure. The downtown station was a bit dingy and smelly, but the one at the airport was bright and well lit."
4,"Nov 24, 2009","The BART is affordable and convenient enough for my purposes. The rail system is quick, too! I took the BART several times on a recent trip to the Bay Area. For those staying or living outside of San Francisco (like I did), and visiting folks in San Jose (like I did), renting a car might be a more sensible option.Only two complaints from my end:1. Confusing ticket terminals. They were a tad confusing for me to use. I wish I could just tell the system where I am and where I'm going instead of cross-referencing a wall chart, then paying.2. Where am I? I think I'm going deaf, since at each stop I wasn't totally clear on where we were - and signage wasn't particularly consistent. On one occasion, we stopped at a station and had NO IDEA where we were. (Luckily we didn't actually need to stop there.)Complaints aside, a corner of my heart will always love mass transit systems - unless they're terrible. Thankfully, the BART is clean, efficient, and available, even to faraway places."

Even the zombies are probably friendlier than most of you.F U!!!!!"
1,"Jul 1, 2013","A big, fat middle finger to all greedy, lazy, fat slobs that work for BART; this includes all workers and your Union. One agency shouldn't hold the entire Bay Area hostage. You guys don't even clean your car trains and you have the worst customer service skills when it comes to dealing with the paying public. Yes, we pay to ride your sytem and you treat us like dirt.A BIG F U!!!!"
1,"Mar 7, 2016","I've lived in the Bay Area for 20-plus years. When I first got here BART was a four-star service. Now, it's really worth only a negative one star. I can never rely on the system to run on time. This is a result of zero planning by the BART board and management. Old equipment, aging stations with continuous multiple escalators out of service. Hundreds of thousands of annoyed passengers coping with daily schedule delays. It's the big turd in the Bay Area punchbowl. The Bay Area is a boom region. Everyone knows this!!! It came roaring back from the recession and BART didn't bother to notice. I do not care if the timing was bad or the recession hampered an upgrade. There is NO excuse for this. You want people not to drive? Give them a reason! Learn to plan! It's your job!Oh and let's not forget that this hulking pile of mechanical junk has tripled in cost to passengers over the past few years with NO added service or upgrades. I'm sure there must be an ""I hate BART"" movement. I am joining it today."
3,"May 7, 2019","Bart is great but needs improvement on keeping the trains and seats clean.  They also need to do better to keep the stations and platform clean.  Every time I take Bart, I smell urine as I walk down the stairs, and again on the platform.  On top of that, I got mites from riding Bart one time--believe it happened when I was wearing a tank top and sweater and sat in a nasty seat.  Took me a month to get rid of the mites and had to deep clean my entire house daily.  It was a lot of work!  It's definitely a health and hygiene hazards to the public. Would be nice if they have a clean, express train where no homeless people sleep/live on available for riders who don't mind paying higher fare for cleaner/safer trains."
3,"Oct 27, 2009","The BART system is quite fast and gets you all around the main spots in the Bay.  I took this during my layover in SF since I had about 4 hours to spare after a super long flight coming back from Hong Kong.I've been up to SF in the past a few times and always drove so this was my first time using public transportation up here and I have to say that its quite reliable.  Took about 15 mins or so to get right into the city from the SFO airport.  I'm pretty used to taking trains since I lived in HK for quite sometime so this wasn't so bad, though it does take quite a while for the next train to come(10-15 min wait).   Overall this is quite an efficient public transportation system that we need more of here in Cali, it would definitely be awesome during So Cal rush hour!"
1,"Aug 11, 2017","Management, the police, trains are all in need of complete overhaul.  Need to get rid of the unions and hire a private security company to oversee security AT ALL STATIONS,  As a patron who spends almost $2,300 a year just to get to work, the quality of my ride sucks.  It is public transportation so you get thieves, sex offenders, thugs, smelly people and rude people just to name a few.  Your trains are filthy.  The equipment is old and most trains need repair.  Just the other day the doors would not open.  We were forced to ride to the next station.BART!  THIS KIND OF SERVICE IS NOT SERVICE.  IT IS DISSERVICE TO ALL OF YOUR PATRONS."
4,"Nov 28, 2016","I have been taking BART once a week from Millbrae to Lafayette. It's amazingly reliable midday on Monday. One problem is identifying which station you are at in the underground stations in The City.  Not enough signage in stations plus limited visibility through windows.Today's driver, leaving San Bruno at 11:30 was great. Very audible with clear instructions for transfers.  Since this train gets travelers from SFO, it can be very confusing for them when drivers garble or mumble the announcementsIt takes 1.25 hour to get from Millbrae to Lafayette.  With no traffic, I could drive in less time, but you can never predict what traffic will be like.  For my return trip, after 5 pm, BART is usually faster than driving."
1,"Aug 29, 2018","I got on bart this morning at Del Norte at 4:15am. Noticed that there was graffiti on the train. We boarded the train and preceded to go. BART waits until we get to Montgomery station to tell us well all have to get off, train is out of service due to graffiti.  I was like ""WHAT""!?!?!They could have completes the trip and then took the train offline. Once you're in the city you cant even see the graffiti.  It's on the side that faces the wall.   We have to get to work. Bart makes some of the dumbest decisions sometimes."
1,"Jul 22, 2020","So asking for help by the attendant at Bay point bart was like asking her if the sky is blue. Condescension, as If I should know the questions I am asking her...hello...if I know how to do it....YOU WOULDNT HAVE A JOB!!!! She is surely a person thst would demand a police officer was kimd and courteous as she was pulled over foe speeding...because you know. She deserves to be treated like the princess she is sitting in her fish bowl all day. So that she can help BART customers. Oh wait....her attitude lends to the fact that she is well above helping any one. Epic employee fail! But hey. You go on with your skills and sit i. Their allllll day girlfriend!"
1,"Dec 21, 2015","I've been to other countries and other states,I've never seen a more disgusting public  transit system."
2,"Jul 7, 2015","Instead of setting a flat fare per trip like some commuter trains, BART requires passengers to pay by the mile.  They post a chart on the wall to help you locate your final destination and pay the corresponding fare.  We waited in line ten minutes to purchase our tickets because the people in front of us were confused about the ticket buying process.  It's definitely not intuitive.  If you pay with a $20 bill, the ticket machine assumes that you want to buy a $20 ticket.  If you want one for a smaller dollar amount you have to subtract value from your $20 ticket in $1 increments.I appreciate BART for getting us from the airport to the burbs in a reasonable amount of time.  That's about all the praise I can muster up though.We rode one of the 1970s era trains that looks like a silver sock puppet with racing stripes.  The ride was rough and incredibly loud.  Actually, loud isn't even the word to describe the grating shriek of metal on metal--it was almost demonic.  I'm prone to motion sickness so being jostled around for much of the ride made me feel queasy too.The main reason I didn't enjoy my ride on BART is because the train car and track didn't seem designed for one another and it made for an uncomfortable ride.  San Francisco deserves better."
2,"Jun 26, 2020","have lived all over, europe, asia, etc. and also in many large u.s. cities ~ the older train equipment is quite noisy and dirty, so if you can, wait for one of the newer trains..it's worth the difference!! also, have spoken with several 'agents' and they have all been extremely rude and definately have an attitude, one even started screaming at me just because my clipper card didn't work and i asked...whyso, give it a try and see.."

1,"Nov 19, 2018","The reason why most companies would go online is for convenience and security reasons. Bart online payment Services is a headache. You make a payment hoping to use the clipper card, bart system tells you:""-        If you place your order by 6 p.m., you can usually pick up your value in the next 1 to 2 days. -        If you are picking up your value on a bus or a Muni light-rail vehicle, please allow up to 5 days.-        If you set up Autoload using a bank account as your payment method, please allow an additional 10 days for value to first be available. ""Its 2018! The can afford thier system to interfaces with other system more often that 24 -48, 5 or 10 days or upgrade to a faster processing machines if speed os the issue."
2,"Mar 15, 2016","It'll get you from A to B, and the trains arent any dirtier than the next city's trains BUT I am not a fan of using BART.Instead of a one price fits all system like they have in New York ($2.50 per way) or LA ($1.75 per way) you have to waste time calculating how much YOUR stop will cost. For me to get from the East Bay (Dublin/Pleasanton) into SF it costs me $5.50. Way too expensive.It feels like they purposely make the pricing system complex so that you leave the system with  unused money on your ticket. The tickets are paper so they're harder to maintain and their ticket machines are nowhere near as user friendly as other machines.Parking at a station? Good luck figuring out how to pay. BART keeps parking machines inside the turnstiles but change machines outside the turnstiles... yet their parking machines are cash only.I wouldn't complain so much about a Public system but at $11 per round trip I expect a better experience."
5,"May 10, 2017","Got my EZ Rider Parking Pass!  Signed up on line to link my Clipper card and a BART EZ Rider parking hangtag. Three days latter, I received an EZ Rider parking hangtag in the mail. Now I can just walk through the entry fare gates, simply tag my Clipper card at a Parking Validation Machine, and the daily parking fee will be deducted from my BART parking account. I'm only charged for the days I park at any BART Station. Now I don't have to remember my parking space number and since Parking Validation Machines only take cash, the EZ makes it a breeze!"
1,"Dec 11, 2018","Where to start... Well let's start with being stuck at 19th St. station due to a missed connection/transfer (BART mistiming), and a train that just did not f****** show up.Not to mention there is only set of rail track, so you can forget it if there is a maintenance requirement. Everything stops, usually at the height of rush hour because the system handle the ridership capacity.Public is supposed to keep my car off the freeway, but it does the opposite. It makes me want to add my car to the Bay Area commute. Just a real sh**** system."
2,"Jan 21, 2018","BART is in serious need of renovation.  Tracks/trains are unbelievably noisy and usually dirty. For a major city's public transportation, it ranks below standard or acceptable.  In addition the timing of the Oakland airport connector to BART is terrible.  Missed BART by 1 min countless times and the next train is a 20 min wait. Disappointing."
1,"Sep 17, 2017","I grew up taking BART and while it was always loud and dirty, it has gotten to a point where it is essentially unusable. Everyone already knows about the complete lack of security in the stations or on the trains, the fake security cameras which were only recently replaced with real ones, the incredible mismanagement of funds leading to janitors sleeping in utility closets to rack up $250k+ salaries, a new station that took over 18 years to plan and open, tracks that could potentially bend in high heat, and stations covered in urine and feces. So I don't even need to talk about that.But on top of the epic (almost comical level of) newsworthy problems leading to this case study of a poor transit system is a complete lack of acknowledgement by BART. I was personally on a train recently in which 5 teenagers roamed through and threatened to rob several passengers, ending in the group chasing someone off the train into the Lake Merritt station to get his wallet. I reported this to BART and got the most irresponsible response. Instead of acknowledging the problem, asking what date and time it happened so they could potentially look at the security camera footage, or any more details about the crime, they just deflected blame. They told me it was likely just a copycat crime similar to Coliseum robbery and that they can't have security everywhere. And that was it. No wonder nothing gets better on BART if they can't admit there is a problem and refuse to do anything even when a crime is reported.Last week I walked up the stairs at Civic Center station and passed a group of about 10 people smoking crack pipes, shooting up and drinking alcohol on the steps. As I exited the station I saw SFPD and told them what I just experienced. The officer laughed and said that was BART's problem. Well BART doesn't think it's their problem either. Welcome to Hamsterdam."
1,"Dec 9, 2014","Recently my usual station began charging to park, one of the last to do so. I forgot to pay for my spot this morning (I've been lazy, haven't got the EZRider pass yet).  I called a friend who was actually willing to go pay my $1, providing the Station Attendant would let him in the fare gate soley for this purpose (it's about a ten foot walk past the gate, in full view of the attendant.)  He was let in and my spot did get paid for, but not without a scolding and a stern ""Don't expect us to let you do that again.""My God, Bart employees love to be hated."
3,"Apr 11, 2006","I take Bart to work everyday and most of the time it is just a way to get to and from work, where I slip into anonymity and hope that stinky fat guy doesn't sit next to me.  I try to get a window seat so I can curl up with my music and ignore the rest of the world for my 45 minute ride.  Most of the time I can do this.    I do think the fares are getting out of hand.  Don't get me started on employee benfits or salaries.Then there are the Bart From Hell days.  We've all been a victim, so no need to write them all out here...My real complaints, I think, are toward Other RidersYou who bring 6, 7, 8 pieces of luggage, throw it all over the floor and expect us to happily trip over all of it to get on and off the train.You who selfishly yap on your cell phones, not realizing that We All Can Hear You and yes, we are very interested in what your boyfriend did to you last night...You who lay across two seats sleeping.You who stand on the left side of the escalator - you realize, of course, this is the ""walking side""  And finally, the Whole Carload of people, on my last day of work before maternity leave.  You all raised your newspapers or quickly shut your eyes as I boarded - quite obviously 9 months pregnant.  You all made me stand, in tears, for 45 minutes."
1,"Oct 3, 2018",$75 FINE FOR USING THE PARKING GARAGE BEFORE 10AM!!!Today I used the parking garage like I always did when I had to commute to a work site.

1,"Jul 23, 2017","So expensive, so dirty, so old, so many crazy people. Expect to pay $20 round trip going anywhere. They totally missed the point of public transportation which is supposed to be value. Pay luxury price to ride and an old, noisy, smelly, pos horribly outdated system and hope that you're not in the same cart as the crazy drugged up transient trying to harass you for money. I had cash to give ya, but I spent it on all BART. Truly displays the decline of society"
4,"Sep 25, 2015","Although many trains run on similar tracks, which can be confusing to visitors, the public train system is great for getting around the Bay area without the need for a car.  I can't imagine going to all the places that we went in three days while driving and trying to park.  I love the trains and think they are more convenient than trying to drive around SF and oakland.  I gave 4 stars because of the loud noise while going through tunnels,  the inconsistent temperature of the trains and the confusing ticket-buying machines."
1,"May 21, 2019","Today I had the god awful experience taking BART. Went to spend the day to join my daughter at the SFO Airport. After spending $46.20 for two round trip tickets from Orinda (including parking). We were joined by two males who (I am sure paid for tickets) that decided to do a little heroin. They took it out and decided to smoke it rather then shoot it up (kindly not leaving any needle behind.) They both were very high and both nodded off into a drug state at the the same time. Called the BART Police who were really not sounding very interested in getting involved. I told them what train we were on and they said OK. The two gentlemen woke up in San Bruno and decided to get off the train. I called BART dispatch back and advised them and they hung up on me before I finished talking.On the way back we decided to stop in San Francisco to visit a friend to find out that there was $5 extra dollars for this privilege per ticket.  After walking over needles and the homeless and smelling the air full of urine. I attempted to get clarification from a BART employee in the booth regarding the $10 plus dollars deducted off the cards he told me to be quiet. NO CUSTOMER SERVICE SKILLS WHAT SO EVER. I added more money to one of the tickets. Since there no change machine working when I attempted to add more money to the second ticket I used a ATM card the machine took the ticket that has $1.15 left on it and charged $24.15 to a new BART card and would not provide a reciept.Got on train sat in what felt like a wet seat, to no surprise since there are no bathrooms to be heard of someone just probably pissed their pants. Get back to Orinda and one ticket goes through and the other one still says it does not have enough cash on it even though I added cash on it at Montgomery.Station agent at Orinda was only person with any common sense he took tickets could see I put money on both tickets and let us go, as if to say yea yea I know this system is totally messed up, I know. WORSE TRAIN SYSTEM IN THE WORLD BE FAR!!!"
4,"Sep 21, 2016","This review is dedicated to my ACRONYM twin in Tampa: Chris W.A brief text history between myself & Chris prior to leaving for SF (not verbatim but in general):Me: ""Hey, how are you getting to the hotel? Are you taking Uber or the BART?""C: ""I'm taking an Uber.""Me: ""Yeah, me too!""In summary, we were both too chicken to try public transit in a city we weren't familiar with. Yes, I'll admit it: I scoured YouTube on the 'how to' vids and any kind of tips I could find in Reddit or wherever I could find them. I analyzed and reanalyzed the maps and broke everything down into charts, graphs, and color codes. I didn't want to take an Uber. I wanted to experience the BART. When I landed at the airport, I felt empowered. I was gonna DO THIS. I asked an airport employee where I should start and she was kind enough to take me pretty much all the way to the starting connection. I walked up to the machine and purchased my ticket. I was almost there. Sweating... such an intense moment. I saw other people who were standing around confused at what to do. In my mind I was like, ""HA! I watched YouTube how to's! I studied!"" I was so excited I had to remember to break away from it to pay attention as to which train was the one I needed to take. I got on, luggage and all... and heard the boarding signal. Within a matter of minutes, the train was moving. At each stop I looked at my trusty BART app and watched which stops were which so I could get a better idea of how fast we were going and of course, see where I was at so I wouldn't miss my stop. I did enjoy all the great scenery on the trip too so aside from the smooth ride, I got to take in a few pics & vids. It really wasn't all that bad. I got out about a block (more or less) from the Galleria Park Hotel and with a little more guidance from a local as to where the hotel was at, made it in no time. In conclusion, I'm a fan and Chris, if we ever meet in SF again, you are taking the BART!  =^^="
1,"Mar 22, 2016","Well, I have to give it a 1 out of 5 star rating. Not until Bart (or other Bay Area public transit) can come up with a way to let commuters commute into the city in less than 30 mins, I won't give my endorsement.Expected Time of Arrival:By Rapid or Express train: From Union City to Montgomery: 22 mins (as opposed to 42 currently + 15-20 mins of delay)From Fremont to Montgomery: 27 mins (as opposed to 47 currently + 15-20 mins of delay) There is no point of stopping after Bay Fair. The train in rush hour is virtually full with no more seats and standing room.Express: stop at warm spring, fremont, union city, bay fair.Rapid: all the stops aforementioned, and south Hayward, Hayward, and San Leandro, and coliseum.Does it make sense? New York Metro has rapid and express trains. Why can't Bart have it?"

2,"Feb 6, 2020","Ugh. Why is every experience a challenge?  The trains are old with zero ventilation. They do not run frequently enough for the demand. I've only been using BART for two months but already leaning towards driving to work which would be faster, more comfortable and about the same cost. Someone please fix this failed system as I'd rather not continue to the carbon footprint because they fail."
5,"Oct 2, 2011","BART is one of the fastest ways to get around here in the Bay Area.They are in a process of figuring out how to completely renovate and upgrade their current fleet of trains. Renovating and upgrading their trains will cost them a lot of money. BART trains had carpeted floors on every trains before, but now most of the trains in the fleet are receiving a facelift. The floors will make it easier for the janitorial staff to clean up!I take BART because: with the current gas prices and bridge toll rates, I'd use public transportation as an environmental friendly alternative. I can sit back, relax, listen to music, surf the web on an iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, read a book, magazine, newspaper or finish my homework and study for a test.I don't have to worry about having both hands on the steering wheel and keeping my eyes on the road. Additionally, I can go worry free without piddling around for spare change to pay the bridge toll.I can use either a BART Ticket or a MUNI Adult Monthly Fast Pass for BART travels between Balboa Park and Embarcadero Stations in San Francisco.BART is a fast and an environmental friendly option, go give it a try!"
5,"Apr 20, 2011","I've taken BART for 10 years and it is the transit system I use as an alternative to get around. Obviously, many people get around via BART because it's fast. Whether you are travelling through the city or across the bay, BART gets you there. Sure, the fares are a bit expensive now but it's more important to know that BART is one of the transit systems you can count on to you get you to school, work, and anywhere for any purpose."
1,"Apr 2, 2019","The trains are filthy, dangerous and often experience major delays. They have zero accountability to anyone and this negative review is meaningless."
1,"Mar 9, 2019","We parked at a park and ride garage in Vallejo, California, and rode the BART into San Francisco during a visit to the Bay Area.Not only was the BART/terminal areas disgustingly filthy and smelled like piss but my daughter's car was broken into (window smashed out/car rummaged through).  Security DRIVING ROUND AND ROUND ON EACH FLOOR on a multi-level parking structure does absolutely no good if your low life piece of shit criminal is on another floor breaking into cars... I think cameras on every floor at different areas of each floor with someone monitoring the cameras would be a much more effective way of securing a multi-level parking structure..  Do yourself a favor and find a good neighborhood to park in and take a Uber/Lyft into the city.  However, if you do choose to ride the BART be sure to bring a nose plug unless you like the smell of urine."

Half the time the AC is broken or underperforming which combined with too many people makes them hot to the point of being sweaty. The train drivers are all brakes or all gas pedal you need a 3 point safety harness to stand up, which you will be doing. Now comes a half baked idea to remove seats because they think you can pack more people in. Failed idea, not enough overhead bars to hold on. These trains hold less people. Bart is a high speed commuter train not a low speed urban train where rides are short. It's physically a work out to stand up on one of these bucking beasts for 40 minutes. By 7pm Bart is running on a 20 minute cycle between the city and east bay which is too long between trains I hate Bart"

They don't care about or have any incentive to provide even decent customer service.  In our case they:1. Charged us all sorts of fees2. Deactivated our transponders3. Wouldn't talk to us when we tried calling them4. Were about to hang up on us when we did get through to them5. Wouldn't even take our credit card when we tried to pay for their ridiculous extra feesBART, you need to get your customer service act together!  You are the WORST I have ever experienced, bar none!"

Due to delays, I'll be there five minutes late. It's a shame that it can be so unreliable. I'll need to start catching the earlier train to account for the constant delays."

1,"Aug 30, 2018",I don't understand why such a big and prosperous city has such a bad public transportation system. Please learn from Japan.
4,"Feb 21, 2017","Compared to other public transportation services in the United States, BART is above average. It services and passes through the majority of the major cities and places in the Bay Area region. BART is also expanding further in the South Bay region, specifically in Warm Springs, Milpitas, and San Jose. Some trains are older with ragged seats and dirty floors. Nonetheless, the passenger experience isn't bad at all. Overall, the trains are maintained well. Cyclists have designated trains. For out-of-towners visiting the Bay Area, BART is easy to use with user-friendly maps and routes. However, compared to public transportations in other countries, BART can use with renovations and improvements. For example, Bangkok's BTS Skytrain can serve as a useful model for BART."
2,"Jun 2, 2017","I'm sick and tired of panhandlers and people using Bart as a performance space, I've had to leave 3 different cars because a group of guys are panhandling and using their bad taste in music as an excuse. When I told one of the young men I just left in car to get away from them I was told ( it's not all about me) . In reality it's not about them, Bart is no s performance hall. 1 pissed off commuter"

4,"Apr 9, 2016","Even though the BART might not always been the fanciest form of travel, I am envious of such a convenient form of transportation throughout San Fransisco, Oakland and Berkeley. The BART is efficient, although sometimes there are delays and certain lines are closed, you'll find various options to get you to your final destination posted along the scrolling video screens by the tracks. Most stations have stairs and escalator options, although I noticed escalators don't always go in the same direction: you might only find a down escalator at one stop but an up escalator at another. This could be a hindering factor for bike users (of which there are plenty that use BART to get to another biking destination!)   Most stops are in very convenient locations throughout San Fransisco and Berkeley, you'll be a short walk from an ideal tourist spot. Also, you can get to and from the San Fransisco or Oakland airports using the Bart. As a new BART user, here are some helpful tips for new users: tickets are purchased through monitors, swipe your card and than you'll be prompted with pricing options. Find where you're heading (usually posted directly next to each monitor, both one way and round trip prices) and select the exact amount you need. Unfortunately, the system always prompts you to add $20.00 to your card, but you can change that amount if needed. AND if you don't put enough money on your card, no worries, you can add more once you reach your destination station. Take note: if you're trying to purchase multiple cards for multiple rides, select that option first before applying funds. If you're unsure of what to do, ask for help! There are BART employees are each station, just look for the box. Once you purchase your card {great value too BTW}, enter the gate and head down to the tracks. Make sure you're heading in the right direction--there are two sets of tracks! East Bay is towards Berkeley (North), while the other direction is towards San Fransisco Airport (South). Watch the monitors for exact time of car arrival and how many cars (this lets you know how far down you can stand). Seating and standing (with holders) available once you enter the car. Stations are called out over the speakers pre-arrival and there's a map on the wall of each car."
4,"Jun 2, 2017","If there is no delay and no strike, BART is a convenient way to commute between the East Bay and the city and even OAK, SFO.  Compared to paying for the expensive parking in the city, BART is more affordable.  If BART issues monthly passes, it will be even better.  If you use Clipper Card for BART and connecting other public transportations in the Bay Area within a time limit, there is a discount of 25-50 cents.During commute hours, BART is pretty crowded."
1,"Jul 25, 2018","The most dysfunctional, mismanaged and incompetent organization in North America. The cars are filthy, they smell, and the BART police are never seen. During the day there are beggars going through the trains asking for money. The track system is a mess and they are the highest paid transit workers in the US. And now we have three murders in five days. All they talk about is extensions and they can't even manage what they have now. The organization should be taken over by the NTSB until the problems are fixed."
1,"Aug 16, 2014","What an amazingly mis-managed organization. Tonight we took BART to the city rather than drive. What mistake. We boarded in Fremont. At the second stop, South Hayward, a passenger got on our car and went to the front of the car. He then announced he was homeless and would be taking collections as he passed through the car. We got off at Civic in SF. The stench of urine is almost over powering. The return wasn't much better. We boarded at Embarcadero. Within minutes a woman is going through the car carrying a sign saying she is homeless and needs money. She is carrying a baby in a front carrier. When she gets close to us we see the ""baby"" is actually a plastic doll. She stops at each row and stares at people. When they don't give her any money she says something in a foreign language. I've been in the NYC subway and other US transit systems. The BART trains are filthy, the stations smell of urine, there is no security to be seen- anywhere. This has to be the worst mass transit system in North America."

1,"Apr 2, 2018","Well well well.  This morning, I saw a homeless woman urinate in a BART train.  Yes, you read right!  A homeless woman actually had the audacity to pull down her pants and piss inside a BART train with passenger inside to see.  As if it wasn't bad enough an experience as it is.  This is beyond ridiculous.  BART needs to put an end to it mess.  These BART cops are never around when you need them.  I bet traveling throught all 9 Circles of Hell would be a more pleasant experience than riding BART."
1,"Nov 16, 2019","Rather than harassing a black man for eating a sandwich on a platform, resources should be put to better use by cleaning the elevators that are used as bathrooms!!  I am a wheelchair user. I have no choice but to use the elevstors at BART. Sadly,  BART elevators are disgusting!!!  They stink of urine and feces.Hire elevator attendants to stop people from peeing and pooping in the elevators. If you can't do that, have maintence people available to clean the elevators several times a day.When BART starts paying attention to what is really important, I might consider using it. As it is now, I refuse to such a disgusting system."
5,"Nov 22, 2014","All major metropolitan areas need mass transit solutions to their airports, and Oakland finally gets ours. Gone are the days of AirBART shuttles making endless right turns. Waiting for cabs that never show up? Fuggetaboutit. Note: you must connect through Coliseum Station, there is no street access otherwise.The cable pulled train cars run every five minutes from eight in the morning, until eight at night, and at longer intervals from 5am to 8am and 8pm to midnight.The cost from Coliseum Station to OAK is six bucks."
1,"Aug 1, 2019","This system must be the worst I've ever ridden. Just when you think you've lucked out and have caught a train, the train goes out of service in the next couple of stops. Both new and old trains. The elevators are constantly out and the 1 escalator is always seeming to go the  wrong direction for you when you have luggage. The tickets machines constantly out of service, making long lines. And the BART agents are on the whole rude and unhelpful. I watched 15 people in a span of 20 min jump or push thru gates without paying all the while the agents watch them. Trains run with such long intervals in between it takes a long time to get to your destination especially on weekends. All in all the system is a failure in comparison to others."
1,"Aug 5, 2018","Probably the Nation's worst system. The train schedule is horrible on evenings and weekends, leaving every 20 minutes in many places. The escalators never function and you have to drag your luggage up and down the stopped escalator or stairs. The elevators were out today. The train was under maintenance on West Oakland from SFO but of course no mention was made of this so you could actually choose to take a shuttle or taxi. Instead they tell you at West Oakland to exit the train for buses to the 19th station where there are no working escalators or elevators. Such a terrible crappy system that is more expensive than the DC Metro or NY Subway and much dirtier, louder and inefficient. And of course, BART officials do nothing to improve it despite raising fares and taxes which obviously don't go to improving the system. What an embarrassment for the Bay Area."

4,"Sep 24, 2010","Something that really bugs me.. (But I will not let it affect my over all BART rating)Men, women, children.. I don't really care which it is.. Stop pan handling on BART and pretending it's for a charity, for your school, for a sports program, etc. If it was truly for one of these programs there would be an option to donate online that you would happily tell us all about- if the money was really for anything legit.Frankly I don't care what it's really for. Drugs, liquor, or even food. Cuz once you try to con me, I don't care anymore.And to those who give these people $$$ STOP! Please tell me you're really not that dumb? I mean really, have you looked at the ""paper work"" they're carrying? Oh, they didn't have any paper work? They left it at home? It's on notebook paper.There are typos? The wording includes slang and ""big"" words used out of context or just incorrectly?My favorite of these scam artists is a young, very good looking, African American Man who asks for a donation of a dollar for a youth organization he's clean cut, articulate, claims a good cause, and it's only a dollar. Only problem? Not only. Does his organization not exist, but it changes names constantly. Sometimes from car to car, or train to train.For those of you who are not familiar with how program donations work these days remember these basics..1. Any non profit seeking donations will provide volunteers (or those employed to raise money) with paper work, hand outs etc that detail who they are, what they do, all contact info, and how to go about making a donation.2. A receipt would be given or atleast offered for every donation no matter the size.3. Since cash donations are rare and sometimes people can't afford to that day but maybe would later, their would be info of how to donate on line, or at a later date.Those 3 things are absolutes. If any one of the 3 is missing then you're dealing with an amateur con artist who's to stupid and/or lazy to even con you well. Also just because a kid is cute doesn't mean that the money he/she is conning out of you is even going to them. More likely a parent put them up to it. Sadly I recently was sitting in the last seat on a 10 car train. My car was empty except an older man drinking a beer in a brown bag. I had my head phones in my ear but not on. Two kids (they looked @ 5 and 8 years old) came back with a fish bowl and plastic bag of snickers bars. They told their Dad they only sold 5. Their Dad said ""Well I guess $3 each is too much, next train tell em 2 bucks or 2 for $3""."

4,"Jun 25, 2013","I'm not used to public transportation.  I've never been on a train, I've never taken the Metro, I've only used a bus a few times in my life (always with someone).  So I found the system a little confusing.  My mantra from that Hilary Duff movie, ""friends don't let friends take public transportation"" doesn't apply here.  Now i realized that there are really only 2 paths I had to concentrate on and it just goes back and forth.  I looked on the map and counted how many stops I needed to get to where I wanted to go.  I asked a million people.  I'm freaked at the thought of getting lost so I made sure over and over again.  But then I realized, THERE ARE SIGNS THAT TELL ME WHERE I AM.  Haha I must have been so annoying.  A thank you to all the helpful locals that were not annoyed when I berated them with questions.  A few tips:-Make sure to check where you need to go and if you're on the right route.-Don't lose your ticket! (happened to me) You need it to get out of there-Don't stand too close to the doors or you'll get yelled at over the intercom by the driver.-Make sure you have enough money on your ticket so you don't have to constantly go back to those machines and wait in line to put more money on it.People watching!  Funny mexican lady that started crying and wailing in spanish asking why the train wasn't moving, to the creepy homeless man with the suspicious looking box...is that your home I wonder?La needs better public transport..."
5,"Oct 14, 2010","I had a long time love-hate relationship with the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system but I didn't know how good I had it!  I'm so sorry, BART!  BART, you are the most used, convenient and reliable rapid transit system in the West Coast for a reason - bar none!MOST USED:Approximately 350,000 passengers ride BART every week, making it the fifth-busiest rapid transit system in the United States!  This is almost 200,000 more passengers than those that ride the Los Angeles County Metro Rail Red and Purple Line combined!  (Los Angeles and Orange County really needs to get with the program when it comes to use and priority it puts on public transportation, but we all know that!)  CONVENIENT:BART runs from 4a.m. to midnight and arrives at its destination about every 15 minutes!  And each stop it makes in-between is no more than two minutes!  BART continues to use its resources to improve the quality of the system and its ability to serve the public transportation needs. Some modernizations include major overhauls of the stations and extensions to the area covered by the BART lines.RELIABLE:BART has reportedly one of the highest on-time performance records in the nation.  Unanticipated delays, however, occasionally do happen.  Riders can learn about them by going directly to their website: www.bart.gov real time arrivals and learn of any delays.  Real time arrivals and trip planners can even be uploaded onto many mobile devices like the iPhone and the Android.  OTHER BENEFITS:What about time and cost savings to us and public safety (riding the train is reportedly 80% safer than riding in an automobile)?  If more people rode BART, this could significantly reduce the amount of air pollution and gas emissions to the San Francisco Bay Area region.  There could be broader benefits, if more people in our state learned to become more energy independent.  We could see a real reduction on reliance on foreign oil!I lived in San Francisco for four years, 1999 to 2003, and worked at the Civic Center.  I usually took the Dublin/Pleasanton - Daly City/Millbrae line to take me all over the East Bay and South San Francisco for both personal and business purposes.BART took me to our satellite offices throughout the East Bay, shopping at Union Square, dinner and drinks at the Embarcadero, lunch in the Mission District, to and from Oakland International Airport (OAK), Giants games, Golden State Warrior games, and visiting girlfriends in Daly City, Fruitvale and Hayward!  (Not all during the same time period.  That would be wrong!)Back then, major airlines like Southwest and American Airlines did not fly from Los Angeles into San Francisco International Airport (SFO).  Moreover, BART had not extended its lines to connect to the airport terminal.  Now, it is the city's major airport/public transit connector.  An already great rapid transit system became much more convenient and accessible after I moved away! I absolutely love BART!  Now, what's your excuse not to love it too?"
2,"Jul 16, 2017","When BART works it is great. When it doesn't, which is about 50% of the time, it ruins days, jobs, plans, appointments, etc. Real Time departures go from 5 mins to 20 mins within all too often. Equipment and train malfunctions. Police actions because, well, our society is violent. The people vote for BART to have more money to fix problems and (crickets). BART management is poor at best. High pay, no results.You CANNOT just wait until everything falls apart until you decide to fix the problems.Seems the American Way in a nutshell. Bloated and top heavy while the infrastructure collapses.The garbage at the 17th St entry to 19th St station is awful. It has been there for WEEKS. Yes, people do not respect their communities."
2,"Jul 16, 2013","I've been taking BART for years to go shopping, to job interviews and to work and it's usually been easy breezy, though yes, gross!  *Shudders at the cloth seats.*  But of course through the years, just like a semi tainted relationship, the bad qualities in BART have shown through a little more once the ""honeymoon phase"" wore off.  Escalators are always broken even just after being fixed, the trains get tore up even more (okay that's primarily the passengers' fault), the Spear Street entrance still isn't even opened back up yet, causing congestion when exiting the station while everyone's trying to get to the office!  Don't think that BART can help it, but besides the usual occasional homeless, crazy, drunk, or sketchy few that may be seen on BART occasionally, there's also from time to time solicitors..haven't seen that on Caltrain or Muni.  For the most part, the trains usually do run on time, up to every 15 minutes except for non-peak hours (after 8pm I believe on weekdays).  Another negative..let's not get started on the BART strike..I'm hoping that the union will come to an agreement before the deadline next month..though it's looking unlikely.  Living on the Peninsula, I do like Caltrain because it's clean and feels safer, but let's face it, Caltrain doesn't go to the FiDi, and taking Caltrain makes my trip longer.  BART is also more frequent.Step up a little BART & maybe we all will up a star or two!"
4,"Nov 1, 2009","You really don't appreciate it until you need it. The ""it"" is a reliable option to driving a mad/maddening two plus hour drive to traverse from the East to West Bay (or vice versa), due to the Bay Bridge closure. My BART memories: a) Riding from school to home weekdays from age 11 to 13. b) Touring the main computer center at Lake Merritt station. c) Riding from home to school and back in my higher education learning years (age 21 to 23). d) Riding to catch Warrior game (1989 earthquake) or Raider game. It's been over ten years since I've ridden BART and things have changed (missing side-way seats for bikers, extra grips for standing passengers, and, of course, higher fares), but it's something that many take for granted. The bridge closure resulted in a sharp increase in ridership and probably lower smog and pollution levels in the Bay Area. For the commuting work force, it has been a lifesaver. For me, I was able to catch the Warriors' home opener in a relatively painless manner, still getting home by 11 pm. In a nutshell, BART remains it!"

3,"May 29, 2009","Riding the BART has become a necessity for us East Bay members of the bridge and tunnel club. The seats smell, the carpets are stained, and every now and then the homeless give themselves pedi's on the seats. I'll stop bragging for a moment to mention though that the BART is punctual and the most stress-free transportation to the City. Still, with another fare hike coming up shortly and the fact that BART doesn't run pass midnight even on the weekends, I wonder that I am paying extra for? ( HINT: It not to steam clean the carpet, although I wish they would.) Last week, I caught the last train back to the East Bay at 12:15 am and found a group of teenagers expressing their discontent for the Oscar Grant shooting by taking down one of the hundreds of Adverts (that in theory reduce the cost to us riders by supplementing it with the Ad revenue) and making their own tribute. (See picture in photos.) With tensions still high and prices continuing to rise to use BART, I wonder how much more of will commuters put up with until BART runs itself into the ground? Time will tell, but personally, I'd like to see the government take it over and regulate it, so that it would become as nice and clean as the transportation they  have in Japan. That way, the seats would be steamed clean. ;-)"
3,"Jan 27, 2012","BART is pretty reliable and dependable - but it could do better.  I have used the public transit trains in Mexico City, Boston, New York, Paris, Madrid, Barcelona and Tokyo - to name a few.  They are all BETTER than BART for so many reasons - most other trains don't cost as much as BART, they run more frequently and they don't stop running at midnight so you're stuck on one side of the bay or the other like Cinderella in rags with a pumpkin and mice.If they could pull together a brand new train system after a devastating 1989 earthquake in Mexico City - and continue to expand the system - with clean cars and clean stations - why is it so difficult for BART to do the same?I give 3 stars because I'm glad it is here - we'd be lost without it.  Without BART and the bridges, it would take about 3 days by horse & carriage to get from SF to Oakland (that was less than 100 years ago!).  The people problems on BART are just a symptom of our culture - egocentrism over civility and manners.  The horrible dirty cars, bad schedules and noisiness are all BART issues.  Bay Area - we can do better!"

The ride to is always the longest and the ride back is always eventful.  I can't tell you half the crazy sloshed up conversations I've held with other stumbling passengers, on the way home.  You probably don't want to know.  I'm not even sure I wanted to know.Sure there are delays.  Isn't that just a part of life?I would like you to invest in some Woolite.

4,"Jan 29, 2007","Am I cheating or something?  There are so many reviews of BART stations, but why not one, all encompassing review of BART itself?  I mean, the actual train does not change from station to station.  As far as I'm concerned, it smells, feels and looks the same from Millbrae to Pleasanton (with the exception of riders who come and go).I like BART.  Yes, sometimes it smells like someone snuck a cat on and let it use the train as a litter box, and sometimes it is painfully delayed.  And yes, it's loud! (What did you say? I SAID, IT'S LOUD!!!).  And of course, there are those times when it's so crowded that you push and squeeze and abuse your bowels in hopes that passing wind may disperse the crowd that's smashing you.But overall, I commend BART.  It's easily accessible, more timely than MUNI, generally comfortable and always full of interesting people."

4,"Mar 29, 2010","I don't normally write about public transportation system, but I gotta write for this one. I was supposed to be driven to SFO by my friend, however, she had to go somewhere urgently, so she told I could take Bart to the airport. I was like, ""What? How long would that take?"", she said, ""at the most one hour."". Since I was early anyway, I thought, one hour in public transportation is not bad for $10, compared to $40 for a cab and takes you about 20minutes.Guess what? It actually costed me exactly $8.10 and no, it didn't take an hour, it took approximately 30minutes from Market St in downtown, so it's totally a great deal. Just make sure you chose the right train to SFO, cause not all trains make a stop there. The same train might go to Millbrae and another destination too. Remember to check the sign before you board the train."
3,"Dec 8, 2009","I hate shelling out lots of cash for cabs, so public transit is always a big win for me.This was my first time in San Francisco navigating BART without the aid of a local. From a newbie's perspective I found a few aspects of the system to be confusing and awkward. Before I get to my complaints, there is one thing that would be huge if they had in Chicago - signs indicating how far out trains are, I'm so jealous!1) The ticket machines. When I walked off the airport shuttle to get my ticket, I was not expecting the clusterfuck of 30+ people that met me when the doors opened. The instructions on the machine are vague and lacking, which I think is being kind. It is not clear for the newbie or the technologically illiterate, especially when you have 29ish cranky travelers breathing down your neck. Things picked up when they posted a woman in-between the two working machines to talk people through it. Also, three machines at the airport station hardly seemed like enough to handle the demand.2) Signage. Living in Chicago, I'm very dependent on our rail system (the El). What I love about the El is that there are plenty of system and line-specific maps on the platforms and on the trains. I didn't feel the same way about BART - more signs please!3) Stop announcements. Sorry, another Chicago comparison is coming. Back in the day, the El was like BART, the announcer told you what stop you were approaching; I hated it then and I hate it now. Do they send announcers to some sort of training so that everything they say sounds like the teacher from Peanuts? Both times I rode the train I had a hard time hearing the announcer, which forced me position myself in the event I needed to quickly dart off the train at each passing stop. Getting an automated recording, which tells you not only what stop you're approaching, but what the next stop is would be aces.4) Overall BART is very clean, but the upholstered, cushy seats skeved me out. I feel like you can never get those things really clean and I highly doubt they're steam cleaned or disinfected nightly, let alone monthly."
4,"Oct 13, 2008","If the BART were a woman, it'd be the most sought after lady in town. Fast and cheap. not even a night with Lindsay Lohan could compare to the deal you get from the BART.I heard about this thrifty form of transportation thanks to all the helpful SF yelpers in a talk thread I posted over the summer. Since then, I've taken it from SFO to Civic Center station for a mere 5 bucks; and on to other parts of town, it's cost pennies to the dollar.It's funny how I was warned to watch out for strange people and smells, but I've encountered no such things--um, yet. Compared to the trains in NYC and New Jersey, the BART is ""Lifestyles of the Rich & Famous"" on wheels."

There is nothing like not having to worry about parking at the airport, or not sitting in traffic for a day in the city!Yes, Bart is not the cleanest public transit option in the country.  And with the cloth seats I rue the day when some investigative reporter takes a black light to them, but what can you do?  It's Bay Area Rapid Transit not Bay Area Limo Ride and I'm only paying 4 bucks each way!Word to the wise, get the iBart app!  You can use the trip planner function to enter in the station you're leaving from, the station you're going to and the time you want to leave.........then this little leprechaun pops out, does a little dance and says when the closest train is and how long it will take.  (Ok, so actually there is no leprechaun but all the rest is true).So grab your clipper card and hop a train....you'll be fan too!"
3,"Feb 16, 2011","Convenient to get from SFO to Union Square (30 min ride). Just make sure your hotel is nearby the BART or else you're better off taking a shuttle.Luckily, the hotel was a couple blocks away so didn't have an issue lugging my bag up the hill. $8.10pp from SFO to US (one way). When using cash at the auto ticket booths, you get change in coins, which totally sucks. I get motion sickness easily, so if you do, make sure you're facing the same direction the BART is going. It'll save you a headache."
4,"Oct 28, 2006","BART, n. Bay Area Rapid Transit.  A railroad, with 104 miles of track, in Northern California.  Rapid, in this case, stands for 80 mph.  Originally built to reduce traffic across the Bay Bridge and to facilitate commuting to downtown San Francisco, its immediate effect was to inspire a network of suburban office parks at stations throughout the system.  Walnut Creek, Concord, and Pleasanton enjoyed a renaissance due to this real estate boom.  In the past two weeks BART officials have discovered some operating money and have been actually cleaning the trains, leading to a pleasant riding experience.  You can still hear them a mile away, as those electric paddles, steel dragging on steel, scream like jet engines.   BART, v.  To commute by rail, as in ""I BARTed to Concord for nine months, which was cheaper than driving.""   BARTable, adj.  Near a BART station, as in ""Will you take a contract with our client, if it's BARTable?""  Listen.  The best contracts, with the highest billing rates, are inside the City limits.  If you want me to BART to the suburbs again, you have it ass-backwards.  Call me when you have a client in San Francisco.   I still use BART to go to church near MacArthur Station, and I have used BART to get to both SFO and OAK."
5,"Nov 3, 2011","The largest Transit in the United States is by far New York, which has a ridership of over 8 million a day.  Second is Washington D.C. and Chicago comes in third.  But number 4 is Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) with daily ridership over 350,000.Imagine if BART didn't exist.  Add thousands of more cars to everyone's commute to work, siimilar to L.A. traffic.   It's better for the environment, no worries about parking, or bridges tolls. BART has made it easier to get across the Bay, to get to SFO and Oakland airports, and eventually connecting to San Jose in the next few years.  It has made commuting and getting to different cities fast and convenient.  The Bay Area without BART would be like Hugh Hefner without Viagra, nobody's going no where.But the best part of BART is one particular employee.  He's extremely intelligent, exceptionally good looking, has unbelievably great work ethic, a wonderful personality, naturally sexy, and just an all around Stud. Did I mention humble also?That stud is Mike. All Day!"

2,"Jan 22, 2016","I use BART 4 times a week for my commute from Orinda-Montgomery and back. It can be smooth and tolerable, but when push comes to shove it's miserable. I can somewhat overlook the cleanliness (or lack thereof) of the stations and trains. Even though Montgomery is seriously extremely gross. They had people in hazmat suits clean the stairs at some point. That says all. What's more an issue is poor communication and the terrible design of the system itself. When something happens, the announcements through the intercom are barely audible because the quality is terrible. So you're left wondering what's going on and how long it'll take to resolve. Since everything from West Oakland through the later San Francisco stops is going through the same 2 tracks, any minor incident shuts the whole system down. It looks like they are updating the LED signs in the city, however signage at SFO are terrible. I have missed a late train due to insufficient signage, which made me arrive home 30 minutes later. I could have taken the train that was on the wrong side of the platform but it wasn't posted anywhere where that train would be headed. Station agents just shrug and didn't think it would be a big deal. A station like SFO that has many tourists should have proper signs. If the LEDs don't work, put temporary signs up, or stand on the platform and announce what's going on. It's not rocket science. Oh and another tidbit that drives me crazy are my fellow riders. People that stand right at the doors for 30-45 minutes straight should just move down the fricking aisle and not block the doors. Ridership 101 people."
4,"Nov 14, 2006","BART + Celeste = BFF (Best Friends Forever)BART has been a really good friend to me.  It's very dependable and always on time.  If the schedule says that I'm suppose to arrive at Montgomery Street Station at 8.38am, I am at Montgomery Street Station at 8.38am.  I started to get to know BART last week when I spent some time at my parents' house in Daly City.  This week, BART is taking me further... all the way to Millbrae.  $7.60 round trip from Millbrae to Montgomery Street is a bit much, but parking at the Millbrae Station is FREE.  No crazy stories about BART yet, so I'm giving it 4-STARS for now :-)!"
5,"Sep 18, 2008","BART gets me to work in 30 minutes!  If it weren't for BART I would be stuck with all the other commuters in traffic.  Reasons why I LOVE BART: convenient I can read my trashy magazines on my way to work I can watch my sex in the city dvd's on my way to work I can listen to my ipod rocking out to Lil Wayne to pump myself up for work (LOL) I can sleep I can meditate I can talk to the person next to me It is reliableaffordable cleaner than SF MUNI I can enjoy views of the east bayI can stare in the mirror and fix my makeup I can bring my puppy with me on BART (double +) Reasons why bart can sometimes get on my nerves: My ticket is forever getting demagnetizedno bathrooms on BART (do you think we can make this happen?) some of the employees are just so darn slow to help the public outOverall, BART is amazingly convenient and allows me to just chill out during my commute -- plus its better for the earth then getting in your own car and driving your booty to work."
1,"Sep 1, 2016","It's dirty & loud but it is fast. So loud my ears were ringing... But at least the noise keeps the rats away, which is important since there is food and trash everywhere on the train. I did make it from Martinez to Oakland in 20 minutes. And it was only $4.10 which is good. So all and all I guess you get what you pay for."

3,"Nov 11, 2008","I've only taken bart twice and both times it was an ok experience. It was cheap for me to get from Fremont to SF at $8.00 for the day, but I just found it hard to navigate to other stops and try to really navigate SF using only BART.It is definitely pretty dirty inside and I'm not a huge fan."
1,"Jul 21, 2006","True story - the first time I took BART, I sat down, and felt a wet soak through my pants immediately.  Knowing better than to make a scene amongst all the ""homies"" in the car, I slid over to the seat next to me and proceeded to Oakland airport to get the heck out of town.   Also true - about two years ago, during one of my rides down to Millbrae from the city, I got sick of watching my reflection in the tunnel and gave in to pick up the leftover Chronicle with the tempting headline that has been teasing me the whole ride down.  I got home, turned on the tv and started sniffling.  Kleenex became a big part of my life for the next 7 days.  There must've been some fresh germs on that newspaper.  That was my own bad for not keeping my paws to myself.  That was the last time I took BART."
2,"Mar 16, 2017",Trains are often delayed and are seriously overcrowded.  Not a reliable system.  Any delay anywhere usually causes issues system wide. +1 star for not having to sit in rush hour traffic and for conveniently connecting to the more reliable and less crowded AC Transit busses.
3,"Aug 12, 2016","Why do I like Bart? First, acceptability. I can get from East Bay to SF easily. Second,  speed. I can avoid horrible traffic. Third, save time. Instead of wasting my time in traffic, I can work on my computer, sleep, read.Why I hate Bart? First, it's absolutely unreliable. 90% of the time it would be delays. Embarcadero station is cursed. Always something would happened their. Second, it's so dirty. For God sake, why does it look so bad. I'm not germophobic, but I have problem sitting on those sits. So, dear Bart keep up with being fast and accessible, and please take care of cleanness and  reliability."
1,"Sep 17, 2015","Its a huge f u to your passengers when you try to hide outages. An alert system can easily be integrated into the site. Or at the very least, let the people at the terminal know what is going on. Not doing so is amatuer communication indicative of a group of people who have no clue what they are doing. ALL terminal operators should be notified immediately of any outage so they can alert riders before they enter the terminal and wait 30m for a train that is not coming. show ALL delays on the prompter. Its 2015. I had to return home today because BART was down. no where could I get any information online about it being back up. I had to walk back and forth to the terminal (15m each way) to see if it was up. Hours of my time was wasted because of poor decisions to not alert and communicate with passengers. The technology and management of BART is 1985..."
1,"Aug 25, 2014","15m wait at 7:30p on a weeday is unexceptable, unless maybe if we were in Kansas. Cars are way full as a result if this. Also, Im mot allowed to leave and come back.

Just stay open an extra half hour."
1,"Apr 13, 2017","Bart NightmareTuesday April 11/17 when I was checking out doctors I had to use Bart and buses. The bus part of journey was great and bus drivers were helpful.Bart on the other hand had more out of order elevators then Carter has liver pills. This is not a good thing for people in wheelchairs, using walkers or even the elderly who don't like using the stairs or the escalator (which is often out of order too.)More often then not I had to get back on Bart go to the next station and wheel to where I wanted to get off; before, catching the bus.. It was so often I can't even remember how many times I've had to do this but it was enough to lower my battery enough so I couldn't go to Japan town. Other repeated problems almost as bad as out of order elevators, Piss on the floor in the elevators and its' disgusting smell. I feel sorry for the little old ladies when I see them holding their noses. Person in the enclosed space is never there when you need help.1) The elevators have cameras why isn't there some one watching those cameras 24/7? If there was they could sent security right away; before, the floors gets wet or the elevators get abused by the homeless or?How can Bart let this happen to their customers. I wish there was a way I could make them buy me new batteries, because, almost every time I want to Adventure in SF they make me double back or forward."
2,"Dec 19, 2011",BAY AAAAAAAAAAREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAA....... TELL ME WHEN TO GO??????????? Bay Area Motherfucking Rapid Transit. Public transportation? HAHAHAH. Oh you poor San Franciscoians. It's alright. It goes straight from the airport to whatever destination you want and it's very affordable. The only thing I didn't like bout the BART is the fact that it reeked of a Medicinal smell. It smelled like a Hospital bed and that just kinda puts me off. The seats were dirty and there is trash everywhere.  FYI. A lot of people take the Bart... Go Stupid. Dum Dum.
2,"Mar 29, 2019","BART gets you to where you need to go (unless the station is closed cause another guy got stabbed) and it's relatively poop and pee free depending on the hours you ride. After 9PM, the hobos need a place to sleep so they use the BART trains. The entire time I've rode BART for two years, I've seen police officers on the train a handful of times, and even they won't sit down."
3,"Oct 11, 2016","Grateful for BART, but be prepared to give yourself a LOT of time in case something happens. I gave myself a hour to get from Balboa Park Station to Downtown Berkeley and got a really slow train driver who caused me to be late to take the Berkeley shuttle. From now on, I will give them 1 hour and 15 minutes to 1 hour and 30 minutes."
2,"Jul 10, 2015","I have mixed feelings about the BART, which I think just about everyone can agree with.  I will break this down from two viewpoints, and tell you how I arrived at my conclusion. Viewpoint #1- Lived in California their entire life, with a few trips to NYC, LA, and maybe London once.  I would say this person's name is John.  He loves the BART for its convenience and value.  It's the easiest way to get around - a good alternative to driving, and faster.  Usually reliable and usually clean, the BART provides good service for a wide area around the Bay.   He wishes it ran past midnight, but he's generally happy with the overall value proposition, all things considered. Viewpoint #2 - Grew up on the East Coast, near Boston and New York at separate times, and then lived in Asia for years, hitting the major metropolises and also visiting major cities in Europe and the Middle East.  So, even being as generous as possible, I can give BART a maximum of 2 stars.  First off, you need ear plugs when you're riding.  I've read it can spike over 100dBs at certain times under the bay, which is unacceptable for everyday riders to endure that.   Next, the stations and trains are not that dirty, but they're not clean either.   Tokyo and Seoul take the crown in that category.  For speed, BART is slower yet again, because there are constant delays and breakdowns.  How about having to transfer to another train when going from Berkeley to San Francisco?  This would be acceptable in a network like Seoul or Tokyo, but with 4 lines, no.  Just, no.BART fails in my eyes simply because of the network.   Seoul, Tokyo, Singapore, Hong Kong... I could go on - they all have extensive networks that provide incredible city coverage.  It's not just the coverage, however, because those places all have more people.  Would you guess that the BART is the most expensive out of all of them?  Singapore's minimum fare is under $1.  Seoul is right around there as well.  I can't expect round-the-clock service, but even my minimum expectations are not met on mass transit in San Francisco (bus, muni...also looking at you).  Yes, it's better than some other places I've been (Ghana, Vietnam, Myanmar, Laos), but to be such a great place to live and have this as a huge negative is disappointing.  The thing is, I don't see it getting better anytime soon."
3,"Aug 29, 2006","After spending 29 years living in the city, it seems like I just started taking the BART more often now!  Sure, I've taken the BART before, but now I actually have a high value BART pass in my wallet for those random moments when I'll be BARTing in around the Bay.  And you can't help but love that BART will take you to SFO and OAK airports now!  How sweet is that?!  One would wonder how did we ever survive w/o BART to the airports before?  Did we all rely on Super Shuttle before?  Heavens no!  I love that I can go to work, and head straight to the airport after work to begin my little adventure.  And then from the airport and straight back to work, can't beat that!And sure, it can take awhile, but it'll get you there.  And the seats are okay, sometimes you gotta wonder about the stains and what not.  And safety wise, it's okay. I've heard my share of horror stories on BART, but overall, it'll work for me.  BART has become my newfound friend this year."
4,"Jul 13, 2015","Yes it's outdated looking and yes it'd dirty, but it's a quarter of the price compared to a cab and, let's be honest. It's really stinking' fun to ride! Every time the Bart races into a tunnel, I'm tempted to throw my hands in the air and scream like a kid on a roller coaster. Here's a piece of information I wish I'd known sooner though - the Bart does not operate all night! I used to ride the light rail in Minneapolis, MN (which runs 24-7) on a regular basis, so I assumed any city larger than Minneapolis would of course have a 24-7 rail system as well. Long story short though, on my most recent San Francisco trip I had to catch a 5am plane at the SF International Airport and was surprised to learn that the Bart wouldn't be able to get me there since it's closed between the hours of 1am-5am. Despite this major snafu, I'm still leaving a four star review because I love public transportation (weird, I know). So make it a train, and I'm like a kid who wants to spend her day riding the mall escalator over and over."
1,"Apr 17, 2015","I'm lost for words when it comes to how much I hate BART. Everything about it sucks from the ride quality to the customer service. Here's why:1. Overcrowded trains - if BART knows there's a buncha people that ride this heap during rush hour, they should have more trains or cars but instead, they allow people to cram in like a buncha sardines.2. The fares - it seems like every other year, BART increases fares and for what? Riders don't get more frequent trains or cleaner cars. It also seems like escalators constantly fail. Good luck if you have a sprained ankle. The El Cerrito plaza center raised there parking fare from a $1 in cash to $3 in a year. Also if you don't have cash after you fight someone for a parking spot, God be with you because the machines only accept cash. 3. Delays - I used to ride BART from the east bay to San Francisco every morning for work. Almost always was I delayed. Medical emergencies, train in front of ours, stop and go traveling through the tunnel etc. One day, I left an hour earlier than normal to anticipate a delay and I still managed to come into work 30 minutes late due to a ""medical emergency"". 4. The union - BART employees are the highest public transportation employees in the country. Yet they always want raises and when they don't get them, they shut down BART and most of the Bay Area is a sh!t show during commute hours. Higher ups of BART are too stupid to realize they should hire a buncha temp employees to train them during the negotiation months to operate trains incase this moron union decided to throw another b!tch fit.5. Ride quality - if you've ever ridden BART, I'm sure you'll know it always seems like the damn heater is on or you're in a sauna because it's just really overcrowded. Either way, with increasing fares, you'd figure BART would have money to install AC or some type of temperature control machine in these overcrowded cars. Each train during rush hour commute is a breathing ground for sickness and diseases. The one time I ride BART this week is the time I caught the flu. Thanks BART. 6. The lack of bathrooms - the other day may train took 40 minutes to pick me up and nearly two hours to get me home. If you ever need to take a piss due to a ""medical emergency"" or any other BS delay, do it before you ride this heap. There aren't any bathrooms in most of the stations."
1,"May 16, 2009","I absolutely loathe BART. One time my friend made the mistake of hitting one of the BART seats and we were both appalled by all of the dust and dirt that flew out of the seats. Totally disgusting and now I feel like any clothes I wear on BART I should wash when I get home. I'm also frustrated b/c I commute on a BART, and at least once a week there seems to be some type of delay. BART keep raising prices, but I don't see any improvements. Plus its frustrating to see how much more efficient and cheaper public transportation is in other major cities like New York and Chicago, and even in Europe like Paris and London."
4,"Jul 8, 2009","It never occurred to me to review my transit options before, but after staring at an unusually large stain on the floor of my BART car this morning I figured I'd share my thoughts.No, I did not figure out what that large stain was. It was rather creepy now that I think about it. Blood or urine? Random beverages? I dunno, and the stains are always in the corner of the car, but this one was huuuuge.But stains aside, BART picks me up from a few blocks from the pad and delivers me safely near work, and for how many trains are going on all the time I don't think the delays are really that big of deal. Get more routes in the city to be a ""proper subway"" and I'd say we can be BFF."
3,"Aug 2, 2011","Obviously BART is one word, CONVENIENT! Its great for those that want to come into the city, have a great time which involves alchie and not worry about driving. Also, it's great for the commuters that need to get to the main metropolitan areas...The ullltimate dissapointment, for me personally is the hours of operation, they seriously need to consider running the trains if not 24/7, to at least 3am on weekends. This way we don't have to worry bout drunk drivers.The hours is a personal issue for me, because my brother&i have missed a bart train from SF to UC before, and that crap is not fun...it's super stressful!EXTEND YOUR HOURS BART! For those that have rode Bart, it's FILTHY! I try me best to avoid wearing flip-flops when I know I'm going to ride bart. I try to wear clothes where my  skin is not coming into contact with anything. Fair warning the pee/dirty smell is something you eventually get used to. Bottom line, Bart is great if u don't want to drive, and also to save gas. Time wise, plan accordingly cuz your trip may take longer than planned due to all the stops!"
5,"Aug 14, 2011","Part of why SF works so well as a city is because of BART.  A city as dynamic, beautiful, and cohesive as San Francisco is tied together with a mass transit system that works.  BART isn't just the trains...it's the buses that connect well, it's the drivers who smile and chat with you, and it's the consistently courteous SF residents who give up their seats for the elderly when those resident board.Like the Tube in London, BART works on distance-based fares, not flat fees.  BART is why you don't need a car in SF - whether you are visiting or living here.  For everything else there's a Zipcar. :-)"
3,"May 19, 2013","Well, it's far from perfect, but it's the best we've got.  For the most part BART transports us to and from work and other activities.  They've done so since the 1970s.  When it opened it was kind of futuristic.  A little like Tomorrowland at Disneyland.  But like Tomorrowland time has passed BART by.  Now it is aging and in need of major overhauls.   Trains and stations are filthy, overcrowded and inefficient.BART needs to do more policing of bad behaving passengers.  For the most part passengers work together to make the best of overcrowded commute or special event clogged trains.  However, I have seen too many louts blocking 4 seats with bikes while the car is overly crowded with standing passengers.  Or the pigs taking two or more seats and refusing to share the space with others.  Other passengers should not have to confront these belligerent thugs.  Passengers should also move into the cars and avoid crowding at the exits.BART contributes to the problem by running shorter trains.  It is exasperating to wait for a Fremont or Richmond train while 3 or 4 virtually empty 10 car other trains pass only to be packed into a 3, 4 or 5 car train.There are other issues that others have identified, but BART is the best we've got.  Considering the deplorable state of AC Transit, BART does okay."

There's no good logic to not open more doors. We expect a reply to this ASAP.#2 as I write this I'm looking at dirt all around seats and windows and outside looks dirty too. Do better job cleaning. #3 get a better Ac system that supports capacity else charge me less for half the service quality. Get your act together.

Yet still, BART is amazing, zinging along the bottom of the Bay in a tube at 80 mph? WOW! Just go to most other cities and try to get around the way you can on BART. Uniquely Bay Area and very coolio.You lose a star because we lost Oscar Grant."
4,"Mar 31, 2008","We love Bart in our household. Highlights:- No need to drive into the city. We're not big fans of dealing with city driving and getting around and all.- No need to deal with traffic. Saves a lot of frustration and expletives from the hub.- No need to look for parking. Saves a lot of time and $$.- Super convenient to get to mission, union square, financial, and embarcardero areasLowlights (my flip side to highlights):- We still have to drive to Daly City (don't want to take Milbrae since 101 is so crowded and caltrain doesn't have a flexible enough schedule)- Not everything is in a bartable and walkable range. We don't know muni too well, but cab it from union square hotel if we need to go farther.- If we do major shopping there's no place to put our bags- Doesn't leave after bar closing time--that would be ideal to have a few trains at 2:30 or 3am...- Would be nice if the interiors were upgraded at some pointI'll still use this for going to bartable locations in the city."

4,"Jan 2, 2009","I agree that context IS everything and compared to  SEPTA in Philly and NYC Metro - BART is clean, safe and efficient.

4,"Jul 24, 2011","Fast.  Efficient.  (Relatively) clean.  (Usually) safe.  Reasonably priced.Despite the negative publicity that BART has had over the last two years, it continues to rock as a system of mass transit, connecting the East Bay (both north and south) with The City, and BART has plans to expand as far south as San Jose.  Mass transit as it should be.  I gave BART that fourth star because of its access to San Francisco International and Oakland Airports (are you listening, Raleigh Durham?  THIS is the way it should be!)...  Kudos to BART!"
5,"Feb 8, 2012","Why I love BART.1.  I can get to and from work easily, plus to any bay area destination with the assistance of MUNI, AC, or just plain walking.  2.  I can leave the car at home and not worry about traffic, road rage, the cost of gasoline, toll booths, cops in my rear view mirror, parking fees, parking tickets, wasting my time looking for a place to park, etc.3. I can read the paper, or my kindle, get work done, listen to my mp3 all while leaving the driving to someone else.4. Trains are virtually always on time, if not then it's only a few minutes extra wait unless of course there's some sort of emergency.5.  Paying by Clippercard.  It's quick, efficient, and you can reload your card anytime, either online or at any BART or MUNI station.Things that annoy me:1.  The solicitors that manage to roam the trains2.  The crowded trains at rush hour especially around Powell St./Civic center.  Sometimes there's no room to even get on.  3.  The lack of restrooms at many stations.  EVERY station ought to have a restroom available.4.  I do wish there was more of a police presence on board the trains.5.  Smelly people who don't bathe or wash their clothes.  There are a lot of complaints about this from other reviewers but this is not BART's fault.  However, the new easy-to-clean seat coverings is a big improvement.  The pros out-weigh the cons by far, as far as I'm concerned.  And for those who complain about BART being horrible or the worst system in the country, you obviously haven't tried the New York subway."
3,"Oct 2, 2015","I'm not going to argue against BART as the fastest and often most reliable form of public transport in the bay area. I will say however, that when something did go wrong, my customer service experience was horrible. When asking politely about a malfunctioning machine, I was instantly treated to the answer, ""it didn't do that. What did it do?"" When I explained, I was met with ""that's not my problem,"" followed by multiple, painstakingly condescending answers to my simple desire to find someone who could help me. Take the BART, just realize that they have Comcast-grade customer service."
4,"Nov 7, 2009",I only got to ride the BART a handful of times and I'm still not sure what to think about. As much as people talk crap about the CTA I still think it's the best. Plus you pay one price for one ride. You don't have to pay by how far your going. (I guess could be a plus or minus).Great things about BART is that it connects the Multiple cities across the bay area. You can't beat it. Also it was always on time and I love the updates on when the train is coming into the station. Futuristic cars but still aging but very roomy. I wish we had open cars like that here in Chicago. It would help with all those people and there luggageStill I felt confused on which line I should be jumping on. Somehow I always ended up on the Yellow line which was fine with me because that's where I needed to be. Overall I am just a fan of Pub Trans and I would definitely ride the BART again. No questions asked.
1,"Dec 6, 2017",I keep hearing these advertisement for ride BART and how the fares will be going up .20. But I don't ride BART because 1. it is never on time. 2. I work in SF and I have to be at work at 4 am. 3. On sundays BART doesn't start until 8 am when I have to be at work at 7am. So I drive it makes no sense to even attempt to ride public transportation here in the East Bay. Now SF has the right idea there muni system is AWESOME! 24/7 service and it's ontime. I moved here from the east coast where you have public transportation 24/7. Sad for the East bay.. I guess I will always have to drive until I move to another state.
5,"Jul 6, 2010","BART is a great light rail system used to get around the Bay Area. I especially like it since it goes to SFO and there are connecting stops with the MUNI. Great way to maneuver within SF or the Bay Area. BART is fast, efficient, fairly priced, and has accessible locations. I've used the BART to travel to various areas within the Bay Area and have had no problems whatsoever. Hawaii will eventually build its light rail system. I'm hoping i will be just as good or better (*knock on wood*)."
4,"Jan 23, 2011","It's kind of pricey for public transportation but was cheaper than getting a cab and faster and more convenient than a bus or a cab.  I used it to get from SFO to the Civic Center.My friend who lives in SF for years assumed it runs 22 hours / day / everyday.Not the case, here are the hours:Weekdays, 4:00 am - MidnightSaturday, 6:00 am - MidnightSunday, 8:00 am - Midnighthttp://www.bart.gov/schedules/bystation.aspxIt's also very crowded and not very clean (understandable, but still)."
4,"Jan 29, 2011","I recently returned to the Bay Area for a visit. BART is definitely a great means of transport. Yesterday, I took BART from Fruitvale Station to 24th and Mission. BART was on time and took me to my destination ontime.When you go through the transbay tube though, it can be quite noisy. In fact, portions of BART can be really noisy so you may be advised to wear earplugs. One new improvement to BART is that they removed the old green carpet from the floor. That green carpet reminded me of barf and overtime was getting extremely worn by the foot traffic.BART is more on the pricer end in terms of cost. You pay by distance. There are kiosks located at each station. You purchase the ticket, insert the ticket through the turnstile and retrieve the ticket as you pass through the turnstile. This ticket will have to be used again when you exit your final destination.Some of the stations are shady, so be vigilant and be aware of your surroundings. The best thing about BART is that one the route conveniently takes you directly from SFO into the city. From OAK, there is an AirBART bus, not as convenient as SFO."
3,"Jan 3, 2012","I normally love BART - it gets me to work every morning and saves me on gas, wear and tear on my car, bridge toll and expensive SF parking.  But to have an 8 car train followed by a 5 car train on the Pittsburg/Bay Point line during regular commute hours is absolutely ridiculous!!  They shouldn't even think of having an 8 car train on that line in the morning or evening commutes.  Also, the train doesn't run until 8 am on Sundays so while they want you to take the train to SFO, you can't if you have any flights before 10:30 a.m. on Sunday.They say how much it costs them to run 24 hours (or even til 3 a.m. on a weekend night) but there are a few things they could do to make riding BART more convenient for customers - but they refuse to.Get with the program BART"
3,"Oct 17, 2012","The essential mode of transportation for getting around through SF! Sure, it only makes a few stops, so it's not exactly useful for getting to specific places (i.e. you still need to do a lot of walking once you get off the nearest BART exit)...but at least it's much faster and cleaner than the buses in SF! It can get a little pricey at around $8.25 on average for most places, but you can re-load your card anytime, so you don't lose out on any money you've already paid for. Overall, I'm impressed by how organized the system is, considering SoCal has nothing like this!"
1,"Jun 19, 2015","Well just when I thought Bart couldn't get any more disgusting.  This morning on the SF AIRPORT train from pittsburg baypoint my husband had to kill a ROACH. Omg as if the smell of urine and feces and those who either don't or can't wash their funky behinds, add to that their disgusting restrooms it's enough to ruin your appetite, clothes and day.SHAME ON YOU BART,"
1,"Jul 13, 2017",Worst public transit in the country. Outrageously priced compared to other cities. Terrible service and dirty. Not worth the longer commutes.
1,"Jun 18, 2018","I love Bart. I ride it often. But it's a little after midnight and the train just stopped in the middle of the trans-bay tube. When I first arrived at Powell street station to get the train, the digital signs indicated it would be 10 minutes before the train arrived. So I feel extremely confident in saying there isn't backed up train traffic. What the F? Boooo, BART, booooo. Hustle up."
5,"May 14, 2007","BART is wonderful.  It is cleaner than any other subway/metro system (NYC, DC, Chicago, Boston).  Unlike most, it has plush seats and carpet.  The trains are always on time.  People wait in line in a civilized manner instead of pushing onto the train en masse.  The other really great thing about BART is easy access to information.  Online, it is easy to use Trip Planner and map routes and find schedules.  At the station, there are signs to tell you exactly which train is approaching, plus maps and schedules.  They announce when trains will be arriving, and which ones when and where.  None of these things happen in NY on the subway, where you have to figure out if the train is express or local, they aren't well-labeled, it's hard to figure out which is which direction, and if you go in the wrong entrance, you've lost your subway fare and have to repay once you go in the other way."
4,"Jul 20, 2008","I love BART. I save so much money from taking it. It's convenient, usually pretty dependable, and with gas prices the way they are these days...really, public transportation is the way to go.I've met my fair share of interesting people on this thing though. There are the nice old Chinese ladies who don't really know what stop to get off at, so I help em' out if I can understand them. There are the hippies and the drunks.And then there are the pervs, like the one that decided it'd be cool to sit a couple feet away from me and stare (and stare, and stare some more...) while openly masturbating. Yeah, that was pretty freaking disgusting.But other than that, I can't complain."
3,"Nov 17, 2008","It was my first time riding the BART last week. Before coming up to the bay area I had heard mixed reviews about it.The BART trains do come quite frequent. At the Millbrae station my friend told me that they are usually nice and wait a few minutes for the CalTrain ppl to arrive. But I guess that day they weren't so nice. When I stepped into the train I immediately noticed the carpeted floors. I thought it was nice, but I thought again about how it must be gross when it rainy and the floor must be all wet. And carpet in general is not easy to clean. Their seats remind me a lot of airplane seats. The ride northbound from Milbrae to SF was VERY loud and squeaky. For each of the stops, I couldn't hear the operator announce the stops. I wish they had something like the lightrail where the name of the next stop is flashing in red. The BART stops at every stop, which can be a bit slow of a commute. The ride itself is quite smooth. People standing with bikes can comfortably stand with their bike when the train stops. The trains are always packed, especially when you near SF."
3,"Jun 25, 2018","BART has a bit of a reputation for being dirty and nasty, and while that is somewhat true, it hardly ever gets so bad that it bothers me. The lines extend to a lot of the bay, so it's pretty convenient. The stations are a little dirty, but the fares are reasonable and you can always buy a Clipper Card. Also, sometimes trains can be too far apart, but it's not too bad. The new trains look clean and sound quieter, maybe that'll improve the service."
1,"Feb 13, 2020","It's 60 degrees outside and the air conditioner is on. Seats on this ""new"" 3 door train are hard and packed so close together my knees are jammed into someone's hip. You can't actually move from car to car anymore cause the engine cars completely block off the aisle. The ""new"" car is supposed to be quieter according to the signs but the sound seems to echo and carry more. Just not a pleasant experience overall I'd rather have the smelly screechy old cars back."
1,"Feb 6, 2015","Let me first say that in no way do I blame the BART union for why BART needs improvement. Do ""medical emergencies"" on trains in other major cities mean the whole system shuts down until the situation is cleared? Because this happens probably 10 times per week on average. One would think the big boys in business would be furious about the effect on the economy.That's not all. The stations reek of urine (unnecessary) the train cars break down constantly. BART is pricey to ride. Where the heck are our tax dollars and ticket monies going?!? Fix this everloving mess of a transit system asap people. I could keep going but it's too much work on a phone keyboard right now."
1,"Jun 14, 2018","Sad.  It's just sad that Bart continues to be a mess.  Rarely on time, constant delays, increasing ""police activity"", overcrowded...not to mention dirty.  Nowhere near enough parking, increased costs, broken machines/systems...It's just sad that the Bay Area can't do better."
5,"May 7, 2012","New seats and new carpet woohoo!My ride this morning to work was fabulous love the new seat material, and carpet is nice"
1,"Feb 9, 2020","Always delayed by 15 min at least. Suggest you plan 30 min ahead. There's always track maintenance and they do not notify you before you get on the Bart, so you are stuck on their trai."
5,"Jul 20, 2009","If there's one thing that turned me infantile while visiting San Francisco it was BART.There's this really futuristic wet dream that looks like Gattaca, is a smidge cyber punk and is ruled by Aldous Huxley.  BART is like being dripped through a crooked metal funnel while pleasant and monotone annoucements soothe in preparation for the stir of emotion when the first wave of wind comes barrelling through the tunnel to announce your train is near..It's really too much for me to describe here.  I carried around my BART ticket with me for a solid week after I got back from SF.."
2,"Jun 21, 2006","BART is the fastest way to get to all Countys in Bay Area.  But it is too expensive to ride.  We pay a large amount of money for fares to get from Point A-B. What they do with the money? Beside extra security,maintaining a clean train & improve the systems, I would like to know. I also see drunk bums sleeping and snoring in the train. Heidous sight, isn't it?Also, the overpaid,& uneducated station agents (mostly ladies) are not the friendliest. They may get paid very well, but they are extremely rude to riders,especially visitors who want to go to the Airport. The station agents gets away with capital punishment and verbal assault.What comes out of their month is like the filth and dust of BART train.BART must be cautious and selective on the hiring process."
3,"Oct 3, 2008","I have no problems with the public transportation system that surrounds San Francisco. Like my trip to New York, there is an AirTrain that goes from San Francisco International Airport to an underground transportation system. In New York, the AirTrain took me to the MTS subway system. In this case, the AirTrain went to the BART station after about four stops. For those of you uninitiated, the BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) is an underground train system that begins at SFO Airport and extends through the city of San Francisco and into Oakland and the East Bay. It goes as far north as Concord, passing Berkeley on the way. The BART moves fast, is clean, and relatively quiet. We arrive at the Powell St. station to get to our hotel.The BART was less friendly on our little diversion to Oakland to see the Chargers-Raiders game last Sunday. Getting there from the Powell St. station was fine. Make one transfer onto the train bound for the Coliseum and you were set. Only leaving the game became a hassle. A giant human traffic jam met us outside the stadium and in the elevated walking bridge to the platform. We walked for nearly a half hour amongst drunken Raiders fans (I was reminded of Sean Connery's line in The Last Crusade about being ""pilgrims in an unholy land""), then resorting to taking the Concord train to get away from the human masses gathered at the Coliseum platform, then transferring to a train that went into San Francisco. Ugh!"
3,"Jan 16, 2009",At least panhandlers try to earn their money by trying to help newbies buy tickets and figure out their direction.  I like it better than the Metrolink where my entire car was asked to move.  It feels more comfortable to me than Metro North Rail.  I've never ridden it with musicians playing.  Its reliable but my friend complained that it smelled old.
4,"Apr 16, 2009","BART?  What can I say about San Francisco's public transportation.  I'm from San Diego, Ca and our public transportation is terrible.  So, I'm comparing BART to San Diego's public transportation.One note I wish BART offered.  A 3,5, or 7 day pass like how the Muni is set up.  If the BART offered this feature, it would've received 5 stars."
3,"Jan 11, 2018","It's a useful conveyance to the many wonders of the Bay. I like the fact that there's a couple stations close to me, but I can't wait for the new cars"
3,"Jan 31, 2018","Honestly, the BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) as is, is in need of major upgrades to their trains, the bathrooms are always locked and not able to use, and the elevators smell horribly. In recent news and experience it is being remodeled (slowly). The new train on the track is absolutely beautiful and clean and state of the art. BART is easily accessed from Richmond to Millbrae, to Fremont to Pittsburg. There are many other stops along the way. You can access both Oakland & San Francisco Airports directly. SF airport requires one transfer to Caltrain but it isn't that difficult. The prices have raised this year 2018. There is also a surcharge to using BART's paper ticket vs. the clipper card. Clipper card's cost 3$ one time. Each time you use a paper ticket you are charged an extra .50 cents per trip. So invest in a clipper card. Elevator access is almost every BART location is riddled with human pee. I recommend you avoid elevator access at all times. It's simply unmanageable on the smell. It is in part due to no public access for the homeless community to use. Three stars because you can get across the Bay in under an hour. By car, can take two to three hours almost all times of the day in traffic."
4,"Sep 4, 2007","BART can save you money.  Really.  It's nice not having to drive on occasion too.  I only  wish they would let us add together all the old tickets accrued over the days.  They should operate late night too(if they could afford to at least).  I remember the races we used to have at each stop coming back from Dublin skate park.....start from the back door, run out the exit to the platform, into the next car, slap the adjoining door, run back out, then into the car you started in.  There were afew close calls with friends being left behind, but it was all fun...Don't forget you can use your adult MUNI fast pass on BART in the city."
1,"Feb 19, 2017","1) car/track noise is so loud it causes ear ringing and probably exceeds safety standards2) stations and cars are dirty -- trash, empty food and beverage containers, pigeon droppings3) station signs are not readable from inside the cars at most stations.  intercom in cars and stations is poor quality, announcements are not comprehend-able.4) service is not reliable enough for work commuting unless you choose to allow up to 1/2 hour extra time in your plans (go to work 1/2 hour early each day).  see https://twitter.com/sfbartalert for a full page of delays in the past 1 week.5) increased potential for violence if using bart -- 2/18/17 trip included someone following another passenger out of train and stating ""I'll knock your ass out ... I'll punch in you in the head"".6) no accountability by bart police -- they will not answer public inquiries about what caused a  ""police activity"" delay (in comparison, local police depts. print brief description of contact and crimes in local newspapers.)  numerous ""police activity"" delays at https://twitter.com/sfbartalert7) no accountability by bart board for past mistakes on infrastructure and on 2013 significant error in labor contract vote.My suggestion to citizens of the Bay Area is to use public transportation in other cities and countries whenever you travel to get an idea of what is reasonable in public transportation.  The Bay Area has become numb to the gross deficiencies of bart.  We pay for and deserve better."
5,"Sep 5, 2014","After 4 years in the Bay Area, I've now ridden BART hundreds of times and a review is well overdue. However, since this is my 150th review, and channeling Amy Z's cable car review, I'm going to do something a little different.Here are 10 things I've seen on BART or at stations over the years:10. Myself, carrying a windsurfing mast (it's 7 foot broken down). BART police came to check it out. 9. Wine bottle opener left on a bench. Now attached to kitchen via uphaul (bungee cord) to sailing club kitchen table. 8. Woman dressed as twister game at Halloween. 7. The great view from the Rockridge platform. 6.  A/C breaking down during the middle of summer. 5. The guy who plays Cello on the Pittsburg line. Makes a nice change from the family who does bad renditions of Beatles songs. 4.  The irregular Giants, A's, Raiders fans who take all the seats from us ""regulars"". No, it's cool and all, except when you drink! 3. The guy smoking an e-cigarette in my face. 2. The guy who turned down his cell phone *very slightly* after I said it was too loud. 1. The people talk loudly on their phones. My all-time favorite was just recently. A white woman, having apparent baby-daddy issues, ripping a new one from some guy for a full 20 minutes including through the transbay tunnel (and maybe beyond, she got off before me). The best part ""He pays more for my phone because you're CHEAP!"". Just how do you get two guys to pay for your phone? All in all, BART is pretty great. The problem is the occasional idiots, which are hardly their fault. Staff have always been nice to me, it's almost always reliable. It just doesn't go everywhere. Go on, admit it. You love BART too."
1,"Aug 6, 2014","The filthiest, most corrupt public transit organization in America - after MUNI. I cant remember the last time I had access to one of their filthy seats -it's always packed with non-functioning A/C it seems. I loooove watching the booth agents read the newspaper while they collect their $100k comp while giving attitude to tourists. Someone needs to record their jobs on Youtube for all to see where their fare money and tax dollars are going.It will be particularly funny when the $500 million connector to Oakland Airport results in fares skyrocketing again - or when smart groups of business travelers split the $13 cab fare from Coliseum directly to the terminal door - rather than risking their wallet on the $6 driverless trams crawling to the Oakland Airport parking lot. Even better would be smart Uber or Lyft drivers shuttling airport patrons back to the terminal for $9 a run. And we will NEVER forget the one week strike that held us all hostage. I was unable to visit a sick relative. Did you enjoy your little strike ? So much corruption, it makes me sick to pay them."
5,"Dec 19, 2015",We are still tourists getting the hang of BART.  But when we do get it right - BART is fabulous in getting people around San Francisco.  We were helped by the good people on the train with some of our questions and we didn't discover the website for BART until the end of this trip - better than some of the apps we had on our phones.  It was nice to think about helping the environment getting from The Wharf to SFO as well as getting there so quickly and efficiently.
2,"Jun 15, 2015","Bart is only good for getting from point A to point B, though you should expect to feel gross as hell by the time you get to point B every single day.  I'm not going to complain about the stinky messes on every car, those types of events are hard to control because of the shear number of disgusting people in Bay Area.My main gripes with Bart are:  1.  It is always late.  Always.  2.  It is usually vastly over-crowded, likely because it's always late.  3.  The cars are humid as fuck, even when not crowded.  To touch upon the last point a bit, I'm a decently fit guy yet every SINGLE morning, I have to plan extra time on the way to my SF office bathroom to utilize paper towels for wiping all the sweat off my body resulting from the humid-assed Bart cars.  This morning in particular, it was decently cold outside.  I chose to wear my lightest jacket, and I STILL was sweating my ass off, along with everyone else, in my Bart car (which surprisingly was not over-crowded like it usually is).  I'm almost 100% sure the heat wasn't even on.  You want to know what the real culprit is??? No fucking air-flow.  When you have no fans (or shitty fans) operating within Bart cars, the shear number of people alone will turn it into a disgustingly sweaty eco-system for disease."
3,"Feb 14, 2009","I take BART just about everyday to and from work (S. Hayward station to Macarthur station). The Pros: I save on gas (big truck not so good on gas), I don't have to pay for parking at work (not to mention maneuvering around the garage with the truck), I get to relax/sleep/read to and from work, I've made friends on BART (those regulars you see everyday), avoid traffic, no chance of getting into a car accident, wear and tear on a vehicle, it's usually on time by the minute (which in turn makes you more punctual), and above all,  it's good for the environment!The Cons:You don't get to enjoy driving your vehicle, the crazy/drunk/drugged out hoodlums and/or lowlifes, the stops aren't as convenient as the NY subway for example (after getting to my stop, I still have to take a shuttle to work), it takes a little longer than if I actually drove to work, it sometimes gets dirty, without an ipod, you cant fall asleep bc of the immature people that talk loud on their phones, it can sometimes gets crowded, if you ever take BART in the middle of the day, there aren't your 9-5 commuters, there are a bunch of drunks and kids that cut school, parking at the BART station isn't the safest (knock on wood), the BART delays SUCK!"

1,"Apr 21, 2019","While this beats sitting in 90 mins of traffic, that is all I can say about it. I have ridden BART for over 25 years up until about 2 years ago, and I can say it was decent when I started riding, and has gotten worse every year, mostly due to overcrowding. Today I rode it hopefully for the last time. As soon as I got on at West Oakland (thankfully I was only going to Civic Center), a gangbanger smashes out his LIT joint on the side of the seat. Why was this allowed to happen? Because EVERYTHING is *allowed* to happen on BART. Homeless sleeping on two seats? Check. Homeless person on every car with no ticket? Check. Homeless shoving you out of the way or holding open the door? Check. Homeless sleeping in the stations by the dozen? Check. Human waste smell in every city station (yes, just like you've heard)? Check. Want to know the response when you call to complain? ""It's not a crime to be homeless."" That is seriously the response they give you, verbatim. Yes, but it IS a crime to ride without a ticket. I PAY for this service, they do NOT. I will never ride this mobile homeless shelter ever again if at all possible."
1,"Jun 25, 2019","I used to take Bart to Oakland and then take the sky shuttle to the airport. I stopped doing that, due to feeling unsafe. As a female alone I just had to many weird things happen on Bart to make me feel safe. Not once did I ever see a security person or anyone that protected us on the trains. I now ask a friend to take me to the airport. If I use Bart now it is only in a group situation & somewhere local. How sad because I enjoyed my independence once and not depending on others to take me at odd times."

2,"Sep 16, 2017","Bart or Bay Area Rapid Transit, a convenient inconvenience. Yes they transport over 400,00 patrons to and from the East Bay everyday. Now for the downsides... As fares continue to rise, we as the lowly patrons have come no closer to an end to the constant delays associated with: Track Issues, Medical Emergencies, Police Activity, Train Back-ups, and Single Tracking. Why is it when you get to those stations, it is as if nothing happened, is it just me? If you're running late just be a big boy/girl as an agency and say ""We apologize, but we're running late today."" I'm not saying that these things do not happen, however there are about 3 delays a week, and these are the regular announcements, if there are any announcements made. I'd honestly feel a whole lot better if you'd actually be truthful with me though. So on top of all of this, Bart employees treat their patrons like garbage, get paid a whole lot to do so, and throw in a strike from time to time. All of this is not the way a public transport system and/or any company should operate. Look I am just a patron who helps you as an individual/company (Bart) pay for the gas in your expensive car, it is not my fault that you live outside your means, do not take that out on us as patrons. Bad Attitudes, Expensive Fares, Expensive Parking, Terrible Bathrooms all make up the face that is Bart. With all this being said, I still take Bart everyday, because what alternative do I have that is environmentally and socially conscious and correct. DO A BETTER JOB AT BEING COURTEOUS, RESPECTFUL, AND APPROPRIATE, JUST MAYBE YOU'D HAVE LESS COMPLAINTS!* This stems from an incident that happened to me yesterday (Sept. 15th, 2017), when I was verbally accosted by a Bart employee named Adriana @ the MacArthur Station in Oakland, CA. A complaint has been filed. If you are a patron and you have ever been singled-out, or disrespected... Make your voice known!"
3,"Sep 7, 2015","BART parking is priced too low, and the lots fill up immediately (meaning prior to 8AM).I traveled to San Francisco Bay Area for the 2nd time, two  years in a row for the VMworld Conference held at the Moscone Convention Center. BART is the only option really if you choose to stay in a motel/hotel outside San Francisco as there is little or no parking downtown. Keep in mind the hotel rooms are $300 to $600 per night during this convention.Since my first session was never before 8:30AM, I thought I would ride the BART system into downtown around 8AM. The problem is you WILL NOT find a parking space at most of their park and ride locations. I went from station to station using the WAZE app on my phone on two different mornings. Here are the stations I could not find parking at after 8AM:No Parking after 8AM (until 10AM): Richmond, Berkley NorthThe only station I consistently found good parking was at Hayward.The cost to park varies, from $2/day to $2.50/day. I heard from other travelers on the system that the parking rate has gone up to the aforementioned prices. They need to consider raising these per day rates again, to reduce the number of people using the parking lot so that travelers like myself have half a chance to park their rental cars. I would go even as far as having a designated section of the their lots where you can choose to pay a higher rate, as in $5/day to pretty much guarantee parking for riders who are willing to pay more to save time, etc.The trains themselves are fine, arrive and depart on time and charge according to distance traveled. My average fare was $4.90 per trip. The need more fare card machines inside and outside the stations too as some are broken, or only accept cash.The only other MAJOR problem with BART is they take the system out of service too often between Oakland and San Francisco to perform maintenance. This is the second time this summer the system has been down for more than one day."

What the fuck is up with your ticket machines?$5, minus $1, minus $1, minus $1, minus 5 cents, minus 5 cents, minus 5 cents divided by the square root of Pi, minus 5 cents, minus 5 cents, carry the 1, multiplied by your 7th grade gym locker combination plus your hat size...and then it spits out a ticket.Then you have to figure out what train goes where. I've heard that there is a civilization of New Yorkers who got lost and now live in the tunnels wandering around surviving on awesome burritos._____"
4,"Feb 5, 2010","For reasons both familial and professional, I've always considered myself bi. Coastal, that is. One of the major perks in my escape from behind the Orange Curtain was BART. I love my family, but I don't miss the 5, 405, 91 or the 10 freeways. While BART does not have the extensive range or highly desirable schedule that other Tubes, Bullet Trains or Subway Systems have... I still adore it for the pure entertainment value. BART is where I can truly be a voyeur, since I'm the only one NOT listening to an iPod, nodding off with my mouth open, or completely engrossed in the WSJ or a good bodice-ripper novel. Morning commutes are almost completely silent, with a few exceptions: (a) Young College student on her mobile, ""confiding"" to her BFF that she's pregnant and is on the fence about scheduling an abortion. ""Promise me, no - seriously - swear to me that you WILL NOT TELL ANYONE!"" She practically screamed into her cell. ""Can you hear me now? Yeah, so... where was I? Oh, I'm going to Italy for that work-study... in the Spring, and he's like... hella freaked out. I know. So, of course I wanna have kids someday, just not right now. But PROMISE me you will NOT LET THIS GET OUT. I would be so embarrassed if anyone knew."" (b) I have watched educated, professional women (primarily) hold onto the rails, and LICK THEIR FINGERS between each page turn of their bodice-ripper book. And eat full-blown meals, ranging from McBillions to coffee house muffins and sandwiches. Fascinating AND disgusting. Purell, anyone? And maybe pay attention to the fine you can incur for eating on BART, never mind the microbes, germs and other filth you're ingesting along with that bagel. (c) Jeebus, Mary and Joseph... what is that horrific smell? It *could* be the Service Dog... or maybe it was actually that corpulent guy 2 seats over, who conspicuously shifted his weight and now looks more notably relieved. Yeah... even the Service Dog is whimpering, it was the guy. (d) My favorite: A woman and her 2 young children board; a guy in a suit and tie is sitting on the inside of a 4 seater configuration; Mom and kids are facing each other. Mom is multi-tasking - alternately berating her children or threatening to beat them. The oldest is in first grade, tops. All of this dramz while she's on her cell, regaling her friend about the fight she had with ""some bitch"" - and she's dropping the F-bomb like it's going out of style. I felt empathy for the children, but they were so insubordinate and unfazed by the stream of profanity spewing from their Mom's mouth, it was actually very sad. ""Oh, wait, girl - I'm gonn' hafta call you back, I'm goin' through a - Hello?"" She'd start in on the kids again. ""Why didn't you let yo' sister use the bathroom this mornin'? What the f*ck is wrongwitchoo? Y'all better f*cken get yo' sh*t together; 'cuz I ain't gonn' tell you one mo' 'gain."" WTF? My degree is in Literary Journalism, so all of the grammatical issues were a very close second in the whole level of discomfort for how the children were treated. Not to mention the poor suit and tie man, who seemed to be melting into the wall, so as to put as much space between himself and Moms. ""Oh, girl... So where was I? Oh, yeah - so then I called her up and was all, Bitch, you don't know me! I will f*ck you up!"" Road Rage vs. BART Dramz. But seriously, Girl: I do not f*ckin' miss the sh*tty traffic - AND I AIN'T GONN' TELL YOU ONE MO' 'GAIN!"
1,"Sep 13, 2016","It's never on time & smells so bad. Don't plan as using bart as your first option because you will either get fired for being late to work or when you get off, you are going to smell like dirt. Please choose wisely and make bart your last transportation option"
1,"Mar 21, 2007","The tickets: - I've had more tickets lose their magnetic info than I care to consider.  The last time I talked to a booth person about it there was a sign on the window listing what could de-magnetize the card: cell phones, credit cards, keys, cameras, change, etc.  Why not just say ""anything you have in your pockets"" and be done with it?  Where am I supposed to keep the fucking thing, in my teeth like a pirate? - When you have to set up booths to exchange the ""tiny tickets"" with remainders on them, your system is fundamentally flawed.  When the prices are set up so that there is no reasonably easy way to travel regularly without ending up with remainders, your system is a god damn scam. - BART finally implemented their EZ-Rider tickets, like an EZ pass for BART people.  It's a limited program (WHY?) and you have to MAIL-IN a printed out PDF application.  I suppose this is better than sending a herald, or having it delivered by Pony Express, but what the hell, man??? The Stations: - The spectrum of filth varies from abattoir to back-alley, often scented with that horrible industrial cleanser.  No trash cans = trash on floor, on seats, on me. - Manned by the most languid and irritatingly snobby people, the Ticket Booths are a mecca for institutionalized smartassery and heavy-lidded unhelpfulness.  No, I didn't jump the turnstyle, yes I know I have to use the ticket on the way out, no I didn't keep the ticket next to my cell phone - what's that?  Oh, the ticket is ""bad""?  Thanks for a voucher to go to a different station and turn it in to an exchange program - ARE YOU EFFIN SERIOUS???  (answer: yes)  No one could say ""sorry sir"" and mean it less than these drones. - The Embarcadero escalators are broken every single day.  EVERY DAY!  For years it's been like that.  I know the names of the repair people's KIDS for crying out loud. - I'm sure there's a good reason to have BART police outside the station in cars, but I'm not sure how much that helps me inside on the platform when Dr. Empty-Your-Pockets comes by. The Trains: - Public transportation that essentially dries up at 8PM is good for Backass, Nowhere but it's full-bore bullshit for a city that I think everyone would agree is one of the top-10 in the world.  Full closure at midnight?  Bollocks. - LRN 2 DRIVE PLZ.  At least 3 times this month the train has just gone right on down the platform, half the train past the station and half on the platform.  I don't even run to catch up like everyone else, I just laugh. - I'd like an hour or so in a closed room with the fucking hippie who decided that wrapped sponges was a good idea for public transportation seats.  God help you when there's a rainy day and you feel that wonderful gush of WMDs squirt out of your chair into your pants.  Hmm, I wonder how many thousands of diseases just went up my ass? ZERO stars.  ZERO do you hear me!?!?"
1,"Oct 17, 2013","UPDATE:  I just read this article about the BART strike and the reasons why negotiations broke down over work rules and the ""past practices"" clause.http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/BART-workers-go-on-strike-4904918.phpScroll all the way to the bottom of page 2 and read the summary of the negotiation points.Read the work rules changes proposed-- electronic paycheck stubs, emailing reports, and scheduling changes.Are you fucking kidding me???  The Union refused the offer from management because they don't want to switch to EMAILS?*facepalm*If the union members don't own computers and don't know how to use email, then they're probably not qualified to operate and program electronic trains.--------------------Un-fucking-believable.  After 3 months of negotiations, the union and BART management can't come to an agreement?  What are they doing in there every day?  Just staring at each other and saying ""fuck you""?Both sides are assholes.  I don't even take BART, and this is causing major disruptions in my work because my coworkers do.One star, but I'd give them zero stars if I could!!!"
4,"Mar 2, 2010","Long story short: I LOVE the BART.  I wish we had public transportation like this down in LA.Long story long:Otherwise known as Bay Area Rapid Transit, the BART is such a convenient and reliable means of transportation in and around San Francisco.  Each line reaches to 5 vital areas of the bay.  It goes as far South as Daly City to the Southwest, Fremont to the Southeast, Dublin and Pleasanton to the East, Concord and Pittsburg to the Northeast, and Richmond to the North.  They all run through the city center and covers all the major areas such as SFO, Oakland and its airport, and Berkeley.Each station is laid out slightly differently and even some stations will have multiple access points, but it all leads to the trains below.  Early in the morning and late in the afternoon, these trains will be packed with commuting professionals and even students.  Depending on which station you're at and the line, a train will come every few minutes.  As long as you're going to a station that serves multiple lines, you can hop on either train.This isn't the first time I've used the BART.  I've used it a few times over the years whenever I've been in the bay area, but my most recent trip, I relied HEAVILY on the BART to get me in and around town.  Fares are really cheap and you can purchase a $20 ticket that will most likely get you through the day depending on how many times you're in and out of the train.  When I drove up from San Jose to SFO, I purchased a $20 ""all day pass"" that took me into town so I could check into my hostel, then used it to get to Berkeley, going in and out a couple more times, then one last time to get back from Berkeley after dinner, and I still had a couple dollars to spare.  The next day, I just took that ticket and reloaded it with another $20.  That was enough to last me the remaining 1+ day I was in town.The stations themselves aren't the cleanest or the nicest, but they're relatively safe during the day.  I probably still wouldn't recommend traveling alone late at night if you are a woman.  The tunnels are virtually empty and well, you can never be too careful in a place like that.  Not to say you should fear for your life, but as some people say, ""better safe than sorry"".The stations in town are probably the best because they drop you off at some key places.  Embarcadero station drops you off 2 blocks from the Ferry Building, and the red line stops right in Downtown Berkeley.  It really is a prime example of convenience.  It's definitely much cheaper than taking a cab all over town.  Combine the BART with all the walking I did, it was a great way to get around town.I wish we had public transportation that was this reliable and convenient down here in LA.  Trust me, I've taken the metro and it's not as convenient as BART.I will always continue using the BART whenever I'm in the bay"
5,"Aug 18, 2009","In the last few years, I have come to the conclusion that I live on the West Coast and I am stationed in Seattle. I have easy access to, people to see, and things to do, in every major city destined to fall into the Pacific Ocean. I hit SF, SD, PDX, and LA at least once a year now that I get every other weekend to MYSELF (yay divorce and joint custody!)What sets SF apart from all these other cities? NO MOTHER FUCKER IS WILLING TO PICK MY ROYAL ASS UP FROM THE AIRPORT. Ok, so 99% of my friends here don't have cars - BUT STILL, they can be rented. I'm just saying....Anyhoo - my M.O. has been to suck it up and take a cab for $1.5 M. Fuck it, it's just money - they'll make more and it will somehow fall into my pocket. And I really don't like hauling all my shit around with me through crowded city streets - it makes me all off balance and I'm tippy - I'll just fall right over. However, on this trip I was shamed into taking the MF train into town:ME: I'll just rent a car this time - fuck it. We needs one anyhow.FRIEND: OH MY GOD TAKE THE FUCKING TRAIN YOU SPOILED ROTTEN PRINCESS, I WILL GET THE CAR TOMORROW.ME: BUT MY BAG IS HEAVY. Jesus. I'll just take a cab.FRIEND: CAN YOU  PAY OFF MY FUCKING STUDENT LOANS TOO MONEY BAGS??? JESUS, JUST TAKE THE TRAIN.ME: OK! *hobbles off to find BART platform, takes a couple wrong turns, and final makes it mumbling to self all the way about the niceness of airport pick-ups and how many I have made in my short life*I sat down on the train with all my two-tons of crap, put on my headphones and settled in. Immediately I remembered the last time I was on BART...I think I was 16 visiting, my step-g-parents in Orinda. I was given a pile of money, dropped off at the BART station and sent on my merry way. I remember being excited to be sent off to explore on my own, at the prospect of maybe scoring some freaking drugs in the big city and to ride the fancy NEW train (yes it was 1986....  :/) I am fairly certain the first thing I did when I sat down on the train was put on my headphones and settle in...I am fairly certain the TAPE in my WALKMAN was U2 - Unforgettable Fire.I spent that day wandering around, smoking, getting all hopped up on Cherry Cokes and Suzie Q's, wishing I could lay hands on some pot, finding ""Jumping Jack Flash"" playing in some sketchy theater on Market and being amazed that people were SMOKING IN THE THEATER (which I, of course, joined in), and being a punk kid from a much smaller city semi-overwhelmed by my surroundings.As I remember this, I update my Facebook status to:Nancy B.: The last time I rode BART I was listening to U2 on my WALKMAN. ( I should have added that BART was also still shiny and new back then, like I was. I hate having status update regret....)Friend immediately chimes in: See? If you had taken a cab, you wouldn't have gotten to have that memory.FINE.I still felt like a fucking pack horse walking from the friggin' station to my hotel and I was nearly tipped over like A MILLION TIMES.Rapid tranist is nice, can't wait til the year 2065, when we finally have it going on in Seattle...."

I then used the BART trip planner to find out that the 24 hour service only runs until 4.52am and that the first BART train from anywhere on this side of the bay starts at 8am, whivh means I'll miss my brunch meeting with friendsSo, one star for your stupid incompetence, BART.

4,"May 14, 2009","BART lives up to its name. Having experienced New York's subway and Washington DC's metro in recent weeks, I award BART the best metro system award for our trip.The trains are frequent and the interval to the next train is wll signposted. We never had problems getting a seat. The trains travelled quickly unlike the NY subway, which could be really stop-start.Only thing is for a newcomer, the ticket machines can be confusing."
2,"Aug 5, 2013","I'll keep this short.I'm glad that a strike has been averted for 7 days (I didn't really want to carpool to work).Thank you, Governor Brown (my hookers were willing to thank him in person, but I told them no because the last thing he needs is a scandal).Bay Fair BART Station (8:02 this morning):There are often 2 annoying women on my morning train (they're annoying because they basically cut in front of me all the time).They have a great rapport with the female driver of the San Francisco train that arrives just before our Richmond train (the women actually ride the San Francisco train too). After the women disembark, the driver briefly chit-chats with them (it's like a little love fest).The 3 women were happy to see each other, and the driver is happy to be working.Anyway, the driver was asked about the negotiations:""They [management] haven't come up with a darn thing.They haven't budged.At all."" (The driver was visibly agitated and upset, like my wife when I forget to put the seat down. o_O)I take the driver's comments with a grain of salt (many reports indicate that at least some progress has been made).I also don't sympathize with BART employees.Still, I echo her frustration in this regard:""How long are we going to play this game?""Yes, indeed.This situation has caused me a fair amount of uncertainty and stress, and I know that I'm far from being alone.There needs to be a resolution, and quick.The lesbian has been looking hotter than ever lately (thank you, dear).That will comfort me a little this week as another countdown continues.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJCrb1oNbH4"

I received some emails at work last week urging me to support BART workers and one of the unions.Nope.It's not going to happen.I would be more sympathetic if the trains I rode were longer.In addition, ticket prices increased a number of months ago out of the blue.Parking fees have also just gone up.My previous reviews attest to the other problems I've had with BART.I'm keeping the rating at 2 stars because BART attracts a number of hot women.Thanks for bringing the babes in, especially the lesbian that I have a slight crush on. o_O http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOqk_q4NLLIUpdate (7/18): I'm glad that service resumed on the 5th. I hope a new contract is created before August 4.In terms of the raise, I heard different things. 22%. 24%.

2,"Jul 20, 2012","Oh my.Fun times on BART.Fremont train, shortly before 6:Most A's fans are cool and casual (I'm one myself), but I was around some rowdy fans today (the A's, by the way, beat the damn Yankees 3-2 in the bottom of the 9th).Right after I boarded, a guy said ""mother------"" really loud.Another guy then chastised him playfully for a minute: ""What's wrong with you? There are kids on the train! It's a family friendly environment. You should get kicked off BART.""After that, somebody was called ""Jeremy Lin"" (he wasn't happy about it, but the guy did look like a shorter version of him).There were then some marijuana references.I was a bit nervous at first (I think a lot of the fans knew each other, but I didn't realize this until the marijuana references were made), but after that I began to chuckle.Still, I was happy when the fans cleared out (I was able to sit down).1 star for very smooth driving.1 star for the big boobed blonde (my eyes will never be the same again).An honorable mention to the guy she was with. He looked like Rollie Fingers (http://www.google.com/imgres?hl=en&client=firefox-a&hs=1k9&sa=X&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&biw=1152&bih=703&tbm=isch&prmd=imvnso&tbnid=1ImE0O4xsf0OlM:&imgrefurl=http://www.realclearsports.com/lists/hairstyles/rollie_fingers.html&docid=6m9qFSbI4FNH4M&imgurl=http://www.realclearsports.com/blognetwork/rcs_sidelines/Rollie%252520mustache.jpg&w=666&h=800&ei=bkwKUMPxH--u2gXP1uwo&zoom=1&iact=rc&dur=410&sig=106487334982657483695&page=1&tbnh=143&tbnw=147&start=0&ndsp=19&ved=1t:429,r:2,s:0,i:148&tx=90&ty=75).Some of the cars feature new seats (http://sfist.com/2012/04/24/behold_the_new_vinyl_bart_seat.php). I really like them.  The new floors are pretty nice too (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcHNrL1BqL0).There are some new carpets too, and they're ""very nice"" (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/E_gJNt58BLuAOeW9O42ySw?select=MwV1JNY7gvr9Nmn-fhXNFg#sYmSrwcqpJgBLUZC_JYplQ).Ticket prices recently went up out of the blue.It's not a big deal, but I'm now spending $.10 more a day.I was stuck on a 5-car train heading home on Thursday (the previous one was only 5 cars too- I could have boarded it, but didn't want to).Totally ridiculous (trains during commute hours should always have at least 8 cars).Bay Fair:The men's restroom has gone from bad to worse. It's truly been filthy lately.On another note, about 10 days ago the man in front of me swore at the one coming out. I stayed put for a few minutes (the second man was slow too, and I had to hold it so that I could catch my train), and am glad that they didn't come to blows (the man who came out lingered around awhile).For 5 weeks this year, I had to pay to park. The $1 fee isn't bad, and it was easy to use the parking machines (I always took my receipts- many riders don't). I would often catch early trains so that I could beat the traffic (driving to the station and finding a good parking spot would have been a chore otherwise), and the only challenge at times was to remember my parking space number. I appreciate the female agent who is sometimes around in the mornings.She works hard and often dresses like a Pussycat Doll (her legs are very sexy). There are really a lot of annoying riders (my friend Nicole rides BART too, and we were just talking about this a few days ago).Just this morning, a girl kept brushing my legs with her bag (I kept adjusting my feet, and ended up kicking a guy a little).Another one bumped into me at one point because she wasn't holding on well enough (she sort of apologized, but not really).Another fool a few yards away was listening to his music too loud.I'm still comfortable riding on BART, but I have grown weary of certain things.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGXi69UmdeQ"
2,"Sep 2, 2011","Except for a 5-year period, I've ridden BART regularly over the past 20 years.+BART is convenient. Nobody likes to be stuck in traffic or deal with bad drivers.  Riding BART also helps the environment.+Unless there's a delay, the trains are pretty quick. Most stops are reached in 2-4 minutes.+If a train is late, it's usually only by 2 minutes. You might be waiting 20 or more minutes for a late bus.+Being at some stations gives me the creeps, but I have always felt safe while on the trains.+It's fairly easy to study or sleep while on a train.+Some hot women ride the SF trains, and a few others ride Richmond and Fremont trains (I didn't mind when this woman brushed against me recently).+/-Clipper cards make it a bit easier to enter and exit a station. It sucks, though, that tickets are no longer being sold at Lucky.+/-You may find yourself sitting on a seat that's been peed on. It's gross.Train floors also tend to be dirty (some riders also leave newspapers behind).On the plus side, I've been to New York and Chicago twice, and riding BART is a tad better than riding the subway. BART trains also look nicer than ""L"" trains.It's also better to ride BART than to be stuck on a bus.+/-Some agents are friendly and helpful, and some aren't.+/-The regulars.It's a drag to see some of the same riders over and over, but there are exceptions.This ""uptight woman"" is attractive and cool (she looks serious all the time, but isn't). I like this woman who reminds me of her too.This blond that I've been seeing lately looks like a Wii character (her face makes me laugh).A guy named Sam looks like a slimmer Randy Jackson, and another guy looks like Michael Wilbon (look him up if you need to- the link I wanted to post took up a ton of space).There's also a girl who looks like Adele, but prettier (I better be careful, or Adele will write a song about me too).+/-Some drivers brake too much (hold on tight if you're standing, or you may bang into someone or fall on the ground), while others are smooth operators (sorry, I couldn't resist).Some of them make too many announcements (shut up, already), while others seem to be mute.He's only been my driver a few times, but this one guy looks and sounds like a hippie. He's awesome.+/-Some of the stations are nice (ex: Union City; San Leandro; Walnut Creek).Others are ghetto (ex: Bay Fair; Coliseum/Oakland Airport; Hayward). -It can be hellish being on a packed train.June 7: I got home late because of the U2 concert at the Oakland Coliseum (my poor sister-in-law missed it because she drove- some other fans considered taking ""legal action"" because of the ""flubbed parking""). When the Fremont train I was on finally cleared out, I got stuck next to some loud Red Sox fans (it was a bizarre night).-In May 2008, an electrical fire occurred at the Hayward yard (it's between the Union City and Hayward stations). Service to 3 stations was disrupted for months. The Fremont and Richmond trains were also more packed than ever during peak hours. It was just a nightmare. The only good thing is that some riders gave up on BART.-Some delays are caused by suicides or accidents (ex: Hayward BART station: ""On October 30, 2010, a man in a wheelchair fell onto the tracks and was hit by a train, dying 2 weeks later from his injuries"").-Gate problems (ex: tickets sometimes get stuck).-There are no late night direct trains to Fremont.-There's no service after midnight on the weekends.  -Ticket prices go up every 2 years, and have been high for 15 years now. -The Fremont and Richmond trains need to be longer during peak hours (9 or 10 cars, not 6-8). I'm tired of being on crowded trains (it's especially bad if you're in a car that's not air conditioned).I sent BART an e-mail 4 years ago, and the response I received was weak.Some changes were made later, but they involved SF trains (they were also lame).-Annoying riders.*Riders on their cell phones (ex: one morning, this frantic woman was pleading with her man not to dump her). Seriously, I don't need to know your business.*Riders listening to music too loud (some fools have boomboxes blasting so that everyone can hear the crappy songs they like). Sadly, most riders are gutless (I was surprised this week when a woman told 2 loud teenagers to be quiet).*Riders soliciting (ex: selling candy; CD's). 16 years ago, I bought a cheap gold chain (I was into them at the time). Just recently, a guy was selling meat pies. Say what?  I'm polite when someone asks, but I really feel like saying, ""No, I don't want to buy your shit.""*Riders just being rude. Lady, move over so that someone else can sit down.Dude, you don't need that much room to read your newspaper. Stop elbowing me.-BART police.The shooting death of Oscar Grant was tragic. There have also been some other incidents involving BART police officers. I still like riding BART overall, but some issues need to be addressed."
2,"Nov 18, 2007","I had a lunch date with a friend in Walnut Creek this afternoon.  To get there, I had two choices:1) Hitchhike across the bridge, risking the chance of being thrown in the back of a blue van, bound/gagged, and driven up to Oregon. (No worries, my mom taught me at a young age how to disable tail lights.  She was a little paranoid, so I am also able to slash faces with car keys and know to scream ""fire!"" instead of ""help!"" Yeah, I'm a fun date.)2) Ride the BART. After weighing my options, I chose the latter. On my return trip from Walnut Creek to the Civic Center, I text-messaged myself the following message.  What I should have said to the guy who sat next to me: My seat smells like pee.Quit looking at me.Remove your hand from my back.Sorry yo momma did crack.--End--Well, I guess if this whole finance thing doesn't work out, I can see if Ne-yo still needs help writing lyrics.Wurd."

1,"Sep 30, 2007","BART does so many positive things. It stimulates the local economy, boosts the immune system, teaches you time management, and has a few valuable safety lessons hiding in the package it presents to the general public. Let me explain how.....I assume the local economy must be getting a boost because every other major city I have been to with a public transit system is less expensive. Maybe the money is going to the high paid officials but I can only assume that they spend money, so hooray for all of us public transportation takers funding their fine dining and luxury goods habits. You clearly have to be building up your immune system when you are exposed to the multitude of germs crusted onto the upholstered seats that have not been cleaned since 1972, when BART first opened.You have to have a good sense of time management to make sure you make the last BART train back to where you came from by midnight. Forget the fact that you will have to leave all of your friends who are still having a good time, this is about responsibility, damnit! Safety lesson #1. If you are standing at a BART station make sure you are very aware of your surroundings, because security is not present most of the time. Safety lesson #2. Learn that if you want to stay out past 11:30 it is important not to drink with your friends. You will need to drive home, an activity best tackled sober.Safety lesson #3. Some people will not adhere to safety lesson #2, so be a very careful driver, lest a drunk person ram you off the road. Yep, thanks BART for really stepping up and being there for us. You are the BEST!!!!"
3,"May 18, 2007","My BART ride was short enough that I stayed awake on BART usually, but long enough that I thought.  A lot.  And that's with the iPod going.I have a lot of revelations and thoughts about life, the world, existence, yadda yadda yadda...Don't get me wrong, coming from a state that has only one form of public transit *cough*TheBus*cough*, it's very fast, it's efficient, and it's USUALLY on time.  HOWEVERThe worst realization to have while sitting on BART:""They don't actually....*wash* the seats...do they.""Funny how much denial your brain can be in for a couple of months.  This is what it progressed from.""I'm sure they clean these seats. I mean just because I don't see it doesn't mean it doesn't happen""Turned into""So they walk up and down the aisles and pick up paper. I hope that's not all they do.""Which eventually, after a couple of months, has finally turned into.""No. They don't actually wash the seats.""and then of course the further epiphany that would make my Art History prof proud:""Now I know why that one guy stands all the way from Millbrae to the East Bay."""
3,"Feb 20, 2010",I am not a fan of public transportation except in New York or Tokyo.It was a little confusing at first but you get used to it.  Just be careful not to miss your exit.  I did =P  And make sure you take the right train.  I took the wrong one =P   Buying the ticket was a little confusing.  Okay I messed up when I bought the ticket too =P  Take the taxi if you don't want to take BART.BART EZ Rider is cheap and convenient.
2,"Jul 22, 2011","I was torn between giving BART two or three stars, and I decided to give it two, because although it has gotten me to work on time almost every day for the past year (only late twice because of BART), I have a few complaints about BART.   As plenty of reviewers have mentioned, the seats and the trains with carpeting are FILTHY!  There was an article that came out a few months ago about a scientist from SFSU who tested the seats on the seats and found NINE types of bacteria lurking there, including MRSA.  Oh, and she said some of those bacteria are there because she found fecal material as well.  WOW.  This is why when I fall asleep on BART I never, ever, ever put my head back on the seat.  And even when it's super hot in there, I refuse to take my jacket off so my bare skin doesn't touch the seats or the armrests.  I am also getting sick of the broken escalator situation, specifically at the Civic center station.  Really?  The escalator up to street level was out for almost a month, and the down escalator going to the trains is currently broken and has been for over month.  I pay $10.60 round trip every day.  300,000 people use BART every day.  Where is all that money going?  Clearly it's not going to cleaning the seats or repair and maintenance of the stations.  Oh, I forgot to mention, the Monday after Gay Pride weekend, the Civic Center station was a freaking MESS at 6:30am.  There was garbage everywhere and the floors were disgusting.  You'd think after an event like that they would have had a crew working all night to clean up the aftermath.Although I am grateful to have the option to take BART to work and the Bay area really is very lucky to have a transit system that reaches far and wide and is quite convenient, I wish they would invest more time and energy into upkeep of the trains and the stations.Now after writing this review I need to go disinfect the shoes I wore yesterday and wash my jacket."
3,"May 27, 2008","If my BART train were a girl she would be a dirty little whore.A dirty little whore I'd do once in the morning and once in the evening but never on weekends.  She can sometimes smell funny and take too long.The worst is when she is late because shes usually always on time.I share her with thousands of other people.  I love and hate you.Davids bottom line:I take bart from Fremont to Embarcadero and back every weekday.  It gets me to work and it beats dealing with traffic.  Yeah it can be sticky, smelly, and full of ghetto ass people....but what good whore isnt?  BART is dirty if you want nice take Caltrain.Oh and an observation...and please oh please I swear im not racist...just lazy and always scheming for a seat... most of the Indian people live in the southern area of the east bay...meaning if the train is full from SF and you are waiting for a seat....you should wait near the black, hispanic, white, asian people because they tend to get off sooner.  Okay that sounds completely racist huh?"
2,"Mar 5, 2009","Right after college, I dated a guy named Bart.  I met him when I was waiting tables, I believe his friend lured me over with the promise of a palm reading.  I read more than Bart's palm.  As cute as Bart was, and as sweet as he could be at times, it was just not meant to be.  Bart didn't respect me.  He didn't really take me out, he didn't call when he said he was going to...basically he was like 90% of the guys I've dated.  Why I continue to do this to myself, I will never know.Riding BART is a lot like dating.  It can be uncomfortable, disappointing, and can make you mad.An 8 car train during rush hour when it's raining is just bad judgment.  Kind of like my dating life."
2,"Jul 30, 2008","There is this woman who I work with who thinks she's so sly by sneaking in the back door of our office with her little key, attached to the little slinky thing on her wrist (I always ask her if she works at the Gap).  We all know it's because she is chronically late and doesn't want to get caught by our boss, who really doesn't like her.  So she continues to break the rules like a high schooler, and we continue to laugh behind her back at her lack of originality, really bad makeup application, and need for a little nice 'n easy for the grey roots.Much like my coworker who sneaks by my boss, there is a plethora of jerkoffs who think it's okay to bring their bikes on the train during peak hours, as long as it's in the last car.  It's not okay, and your fat ass and stupid bike are not allowing enough room for me and my tiny little person to stand without getting grease on myself.Ass munch.Hey BART, enforce your own rules.  Here's the link:http://www.bart.gov/guide/bikes/bikeRules.aspx"
3,"Apr 7, 2011","Have you ever found out that someone you really, really like has an STD? Well, that's how I felt when I read that NY Times article about all of the grossness that's on BART. We used to have such a good thing going, BART and I. Now all I can think about when I'm riding back and forth from the city is germs. Damn it! BART, we are going to get past this, I know it! But for now, you go down a star in my book. But don't worry, I'm not going anywhere just yet."
4,"Jan 16, 2010","Considering the fact that I hail from a city that rarely uses public transit, BART is pretty darn awesome. I would agree that the aesthetics leave something to be desired, but the actual service is great! Landed at SFO and was given instructions by friends (who've been here before) to just hop on and it'd be easy to figure out from there. Well, it'd be easy for someone who can read a map. But it wasn't a big problem, as I just asked a very nice transit employee and he indicated which stop would be mine. The STL Metro folks are not this helpful. Or clean!For $8.60 (compared to probably a $40 cab ride), BART got me to my destination, no problem. My only complaint is that I had to lug my suitcase up several flights of stairs once I got to my stop, as the escalators were out of order. Damn! That was definitely my workout for the week... And I decided to take a cab from BART to my hotel, as I my sense of direction is lacking and I didn't want to wander around SOMA with a giant pink suitcase :)When I return to San Fran in a few weeks, I will take BART again fo sho!"
2,"Nov 6, 2014","The overall condition of the bart trains and their stations are ok...but than again you have thousands of people riding the bart everyday, you are bound to see some wear and tear. Also you will see all types of people, from all walks of life, so can't be very picky to point out that the seats are dirty or that there is a bit of trash on the floor. But I do have a bone to pick and that's with some of the personnel working for BART. I'm not an avid bart rider so when I politely ask a question please be civil enough to respond with a polite answer!!! And have the respect to at least look at me when talking. I have encoutered multiple rude people (bart staff). Obviously if I'm asking you a question it's because I don't know the answer to it...no need to be rude. I understand you have to deal with a massive amount of people on a daily basis but like I said..I WASN'T RUDE TO YOU. HIRE NICER PEOPLE...wish I could review them individually."
4,"Oct 14, 2014","Wowza at some of the more negative reviews, since maybe I got lucky and got a good impression of the system during my San Francisco spring trip? Ah well.My impression was that the system was pretty clean, cleaner than the 'L(Chicago's subway), and just about all the employees I dealt with were friendly, including the worker at San Francisco Airport station that showed me how to use the ticket machine. Inside of the cars always felt clean to me, and I can believe older reviews that the seats must've been refurbished on the vast majority of cars within the last 2-3 years. Since I didn't once encounter a dirty seat, and I think I can safely assume you should not take as seriously the much older reviews about the cleanliness inside the railcars, before 2011 or 2012.Maybe one day the system will be 24/7, since that's an unfortunate negative to an otherwise great system. I'm not bothered by the varied distance fares either(rather than flat fare regardless of how little or far you ride), since I know that helps to pay for the cost of this system. Something makes me think the claim that 'the system has to shut down on overnights to do maintenance/etc.', but if other systems can run 24/7 and run less frequent service, that they could still get away with some sort of very minimum service(like every 20-30 minutes?).Ranting aside about the lack of overnight service, I'd totally be comfortable with riding BART again, whenever I return to San Francisco. It did allow me to do a trip over to the University of California-Berkeley's campus, and to and from SFO airport after all."
5,"Mar 5, 2008","When I think about going to the airport, I instantly get a headache. I'm sure this has to do with the fact that having lived in LA all my life, the two main options were Burbank (easy peasy) or HELL-AX (um, does that name need any further descriptions to get the point across??). Now with that preconceived panic attack waiting to happen, it was no surprise to me yesterday while waking up at 6am, that I was a little anxious about taking the MUNI to the BART to SFO for the first time.The MUNI was easy since I take that into work and I know the drill there. The BART however, well, I'm still kind of a newb. But I got off the MUNI at Montgomery and paid my $5.45 fair for a ticket to SFO and then headed downstairs with big ole over-packed suitcase in tow and looked for travel clues. I spotted a map and realized that this was going to be easier than i thought. It was just one train, sweet!I then grabbed a seat and people watched until the SFO BART whizzed up and on I got. From there, well, from there, I didn't have to use my brain once. Do you realize what a luxury that feeling is at 8am. i don't know about you, but my brain doesn't wake up til more like 10:30am, so this was a true treat. The total trip took maybe 30-35 minutes and I didn't have to deal with directions, off ramps, traffic or anything. And it was only $5.45.I swear, this city is getting cooler by the day! Oakland airport, who?"
5,"Jun 24, 2006","Thank you Mister BART for saving me from a $60 cab ride into the city from Oakland. Thank you for being clean and safe feeling. Thank you. And if you have any friends of power in LA, please call them and tell them to bring you down to LA, because you seriously rock and we need you!"
1,"Oct 20, 2013","Come on BART unions, REALLY? You came to terms about money, pension and everything else, but you don't like the ""work rules"", so you stomp your little hooves, take your ball and go home to pout? Do you have any idea just how many people who have been unemployed/underemployed would APPRECIATE your working conditions, compensation and benefits and actually come to work with a great attitude? Personally, I think that a little union-busting is way past-due.I must admit to a little BART bias, dating back to when I still lived in SF. I still haven't forgotten the lovely station agent at Civic Center from several years ago who ignored the thug who mugged me right in front of her little kiosk, then got snotty when the BART police asked her to give me a ticket to get home and she refused, telling me, ""Just because you lost your money and can't afford a ticket isn't MY problem.""  A Muni agent DID give a pass to get home when she came over to see if she could help, which gave the ""compassionate"" BART station agent an even worse attitude.There are more BART employees getting fed up with union ""leadership"" each and every day, who don't WANT to be on strike. How come the ""leadership"" doesn't put it out to the members for a vote?"
1,"Aug 4, 2013","Dear BART Unions:Here we go again, you greedy bastards. You are demanding a 23% raise and you want to contribute less to your already fantastic medical coverage? REALLY?  Your BART riders have, for the most part, taken HUGE hits in hours worked, many working for far less money than just a few years ago (myself included), and medical coverage contributions (if fortunate enough to have them) are unaffordable for many, or eat up as much as a third of take-home pay for those with families.Because of your little hissy fit, traffic will be a nightmare to the nth degree, many people will again have to decide between buying food or paying ridiculously jacked-up parking fees in San Francisco (to be jacked up even higher by some of the opportunistic parasites who run these parking garages and public lots..never let a good crisis go to waste). Some people may not be able to get to work, period., especially the people who can least afford it.Oh, but BART is making money, so they should give you guys what you want? At what cost? It already is not cheap to take public transit from the East Bay into parts of San Francisco. Who in the hell do you think the cost of your overinflated salaries and benefits are paid for by? The very people you are screwing over who are barely making it.Since you are going to inconvenience everyone, at least earn your strike pay. During the last one, I saw more of you at BART stations sitting on bus benches texting and talking on your cell phones than I actually saw on the picket line, especially at the Del Norte stations..not to mention the lines of you in the Starbucks in Safeway across the street."
2,"Jun 28, 2013","Dear BART Unions:As much as I would like to be sympathetic, I just can't.  When your employees make an average of nearly 80k a year plus benefits in times that are hard economically for many of your riders, it is impossible to feel sorry for you.Do you realize or even care what kind of impact your little hissy fit may have on many of your riders? In this day of many people working reduced hours as it is, you will basically be robbing this people. Those who do have cars will get to sit in traffic for hours, burn $4.00+ a gallon gas, pay bridge tolls they ordinarily don't have to pay, and if they are extremely lucky, find parking that will not sap their food budget for the week. What about those people who don't own a vehicle? Do you think AC (if they don't join your hissy fit) can accommodate everyone? Oh, they can take the ferry? Yep, that's cheap, huh? Not to those who are barely making it as it is.Please stop the PR campaign claiming that you would be striking for the safety of BART passengers. The reality is, it is all about you and lining the union coffers."
2,"Jan 6, 2009","Ok, so I like that the bay area at least HAS a rapid transit program. And I've seen some seriously entertaining moments on the various trains. And some seriously disturbing moments. However. The BART service in SF is so limited, that you can't even begin to compare it to Boston's MBTA or New York City's subway network. BART can get you to SF's embarcadero, financial district, downtown center, and the mission. If you want to go anywhere else in the city, be prepared to extend your travel time significantly as you navigate the Muni trains (which are chillingly notorious for running down pedestrians) or the bus system. Yes, you can get to the games and concerts in Oakland. Yes, it's probably great for commuters who truck into the city from Livermore, Richmond, and Pittsburg. However, as a public train that tries to boast the most convenient coverage around...I can't get behind it. I know I sound like a curmudgeon, but I have a love/hate relationship with the BART system. I am also irritated that they splash around advertising as an alternative to driving when going into the city on weekends. When I have dinner at a friend's house, I don't want to feel pressured to get back to the station by 12am. When I'm out dancing or drinking (or both), I don't want to be constantly sweating whether or not I'm going to wind up footing a $60 cab ride back across the bay. I know times are tight, and I'm sure there isn't a huge populous just waiting to work the night shift at BART...but I think it would drastically reduce the percentage of DUIs in the bay area if they did. And speaking of times being tight, what the hell is up with your constantly raising fares?  I see no difference in scheduling or cleanliness of the trains or stations, but still the ridiculous fare hikes.  Not accounting for parking, it is actually cheaper to DRIVE into the city from Oakland than it is to take BART.  So what gives?  Knock it off!  Talk about reducing the incentive for people to take public transit.And carpeting on public transit? That's just a bad idea. Alright. I'm done. Call me an asshole and call it a day. Re-reading this review I realize what a complete jerkoff I sound like - so please enjoy this before I regain my senses and delete it."
4,"Oct 11, 2017","I love BART. It gets me where I need to be. It's convenient. I can take my bike anytime. I love watching and experiencing the unique, special diverse cultural style of the SF Bay Area."
5,"Aug 4, 2009","So I was watching The Simpsons one Sunday night, and Lisa was preparing to go on this crossword challenge competition. She was learning words left and right in a dictionary until she came across BART. Her response: ""A rapid transit system serving the San Francisco Bay Area. Also the name of my annoying little brother!"" I loved it! :-)Anyways, BART has been my lifeline back when I was growing up in Antioch and when I was living in the city. In fact, I commuted every other day on BART during the summer of '05 when I was newly hired as a lab assistant for a biotech company in South San Francisco. Yay for being able to relax, sleep and read like 10 books that summer during my commute. My only gripe: parking at Pittsburg! If you get there too late during the morning, parking is pretty much nonexistent until 10AM rolls around and you're able to park in the carpool only section. That's my word of wisdom for ya."
4,"Aug 25, 2007","Lets face it people...BART IS DIRTY. The blue seats and carpet PROBABLY HAVEN'T BEEN CLEANED since they were installed 15+ years ago. Trust me on this, I remember when this happened. It was a refreshing thing at the time, considering the mucky brown dirty seats/carpet they had previously installed. At least those mucky brown seats CAMOUFLAGED all the dirt and stains. Nowadays, it's the DIRT and STAINS that CREATE a camouflage pattern on the seats.And quite honestly, I hate having to take public transportation. It can get quite GHETTO, especially in San Francisco. I'll admit... I'm spoiled, with a car. Can you blame me if my ass prefers to sit on leather seats rather than dirty, stain infested seats compliments of our local government?So I only take public transportation if I need to, like when I don't have my car because it's in the shop (like it was this past week) or when I have to go downtown to work, because I can't park downtown and pay $25 bucks a day for parking.That's just ludicrous. Anyways, I digress.HOWEVER, I have recently acquired a new found respect for BART. Why? You ask...It is EFFING FAST!AND it is reliable, runs on time LIKE CLOCKWORK without breaking down, creating a delay or backup on the rails. Unlike MUNI, which is a joke.So this past week, a coworker (who explained to me how quickly we could get from the Embarcadero station and into the Mission) and I took a quick joyride on BART during our lunch break and over to 25th and Mission to have our tacos at La Taqueria with PLENTY of time to sit down and eat, then hop next door to Dianda's for a slice of cake and back to work in 59 MINUTES!5 stars for being like a good one night stand, FAST AND EASY and for letting me have my cake and eating it too! Now, THAT'S how i like it!Minus 1 star for making me go home feeling dirty and like I have to wash my hands and dry clean my clothes every time I ride it. Like a bad one night stand. But then again, sometimes a girl NEEDS TO FEEL DIRTY every now and then."

3,"Jul 10, 2009","I like BART.  I don't love it.  It's limited and it's expensive for what it offers.  When I've returned from trips to Boston I've been angry at how few places BART goes in comparison to the T, which covers the Boston area, going to myriad museums and university campuses.  It's been several years since we've been to Boston though, so I'm no longer feeling that anger.  We use BART in a very limited way, mostly to go to San Francisco to the theatre, and for that it works well.  This past couple of weeks we've taken it several times and it has been undeniably convenient.  For us it's mostly a way to go into the eastern part of the city and play, although a few times we've taken it to and from SFO, and that's been terrific.  The airport BART station is clean and convenient."
1,"Apr 19, 2018","Bart Police can be found roaming the parking lot looking to hand out tickets; while homeless do drugs and defecate on the train and throughout the subway. It's ""gross negligence"" as it's finest. Bart Police would rather take your money than protect you. It's California though, what did you expect? Recently, I had a homeless man smoke crack inside the Bart car, and when I brought it up to security, he laughed at me and stated ""Bart police are supposed to ride the train but don't""...It's not going to be so funny when something real happens and you get hit with a lawsuit. Whoever is running Bart operations need to be replaced ASAP. No idea how Bart has above one star...It's filthy."
1,"Apr 20, 2014","BART was a good start but got overpriced. ...and, mismanaged financially: 60-80% of workers get overtime pay to their already fancy salaries. Mngmt spent big buck$$$ for union/contract negotiations - including a 'humble' lawyer who billed BART for max.amount up to $400K and even for his alcohol expenses at the hotel...BART overpriced the trip to SFO airport with the idea: if they can afford to fly, they can afford to pay extra for SFO ride. So now, the cost from San Bruno to SFO - a one stop, 5-min ride is $7.40 (used to be about $3.80). That's the most oligarchic calculation ever. For comparison, a 50-minute trip from Berkeley to SFO costs $9.25. Pythagoras, please don't be offended and don't turn around in your grave. Is BART a public transit company whose mission is to serve or slave people?I will rather ride a sustainably raised cow than Bay-Area-Ridiculous-Transit."
2,"Sep 8, 2006","I do like (appreciate, even) the fact you're *around*, and thinking back to the 70s when you debuted all space age and shit.  But more than 30 years down the road, you haven't evolved much.  Yeah, you've got new stations here and there, but those dumbass destination signs go on the fritz so frequently, it's fun watching all these people scratch their heads and panic after they get on the wrong train (nevermind that your typical rider wouldn't dare approach someone else and TALK to them, god). And you spent a bajillion building a way to get up close and personal with SFO (we all know that airport passengers account for like 75% of your riders, right?).  Oh, ya -- forward thinking for that Bay Area loop you keep dreaming about, and should that miracle ever come to fruition, it will cost US twice what the new Bay Bridge span is.  Then it will cost the average citizen $15 to take an average round trip in the Bay Area. You're backwards and adolescent, BART.  Expensive, spend thrift, can't get your priorities straight, and ill-mannered to some of your biggest allies in the movement to reduce carbon emissions on a daily basis (um, that would be cyclists).  Do something so my 2-wheelin brothers and sisters don't get their rides jacked at your stations, and can take their rides in the stations trains ANY time of the day so they can complete their travels.  And quit you're ""don't do this"" and ""ya can't do that"" and ""shouldn't be doin' that"" bullshit.  Bikes on board *aren't* toys, OK... unlike half the shit people are hauling in those suitcases they put on the chairs where PEOPLE should be sitting.  Again with the airport passenger bunch. I have fond memories of an emergency situation that arose in San Francisco some years ago during the Bay Area's last humong-o power outtage.  I was stuck in the transbay tube on the way to SF in a train so packed, that all the techie-pros on board didn't even have enough elbow room to reach for their mobiles (which would never have worked back then anyway).  We were in that tunnel, immobile for 1 hour and 35 minutes, with ONE lame ass announcement made about ""Oh the power's out in the Embarcadero station, and we're trying to move a train out of the way"".  We were less than 500 feet from the station, you imbecile.  Wouldn't it have been at the very least courteous to offer an evacuation? Despite your hefty cover charge, you're always complaining that you're broke, can't pay your bills, or owe too much on your credit card.

4,"Jul 20, 2013","I've had nothing but positive experiences with BART. Not living in the bay area, I've really only had occasion to take it for special occasions/event - most notably, to A's and Giants games (usually BARTing in from the Dublin/Pleasanton station), and once to get to SF for Bay to Breakers. SUPER convenient to The Coliseum. Side note: does anyone else use BART as a verb? In a sentence: ""We parked our car in Fremont, BARTed in to Oakland, and made it to the game in no time."" We had a couple of very nice young men help us (me, Husband, PickyEater and her two small kids) find our way to the correct train one night after we had jumped on the wrong one after a late A's game. Community love!The time I BARTed in to do B2B, we parked our car at the Concord station to go in just for the day. It was around the buttcrack of dawn and thus hadn't anticipated a crowd, but to our surprise the train was packed. That early morning, we all rode to San Francisco together: a group of adults, most wearing silly costumes, (myself included), all sharing the same quiet, sleepy excitement. It was actually kinda awesome. Thanks for that memory, BART.VERDICT: YUP! If you need to get to the bay, give it a try for sure! Make sure you read the map and figure out where you need to go. Just, ah... try not to touch stuff. I def wouldn't want to take a black light to those cloth seats or poles."
3,"Jan 15, 2008","K, I have a love/hate relationship with BART. I've been riding BART since I was about nine. Yes, I said nine,  yes, it was safe to let your kids travel on public transportation in the late 70's/early 80's. When I worked in the city, it was my primary commuting option. NO,  I will not pay $25/day for parking (circa mid 90s) to park in the Embarcadero when I can get to work for $5 on BART. So why only three stars? Well, I have a history (see review for Royal Exchange) of having my friends (well that's what I call them) dump me on BART after a evening/afternoon/morning of drinking. Granted some of my drunken rides are a lot less dramatic then others. Let me tell you about the night I got on BART after a day on the Bay with Bay Quackers (see review). After being plied with margaritas and not much food, my non-Yelp friend, who will rename nameless, dumped me on BART! Thank goodness this nice prostitute befriended me and was helpful enough to guide me home. I had embarked at the Embarcadero station, traveling in the wrong direction towards Burlingame. Thankfully my newly made ""friend"" was headed to the East Bay because if it weren't for her, I'd probably still be lost in the Peninsula somewhere. Anyways, she was really sweet, and helped direct me onto the correct east bound Richmond train. And the sweetheart, god bless her short skirt and low cut top, was so generous, she told me if I went back to her place to meet her Pimp, he would be happy to drive me home. Alas, I was drunk and ornery, and (luckily) refused to transfer trains again. So thanks BART for decades of helping me traverse the Bay Area and meeting new friends."
1,"Oct 17, 2013","BART is pathetic. I have no time to type out the top 50 reasons of why I am miserable commuting on this train that either smells like weed, urine, or vomit depending on the time of day. You know why I have no time? Because I have to wake up 2 hours earlier to commute to SF because you lazy SOB employees that make on average 22 dollars an hour want more. I wish you would all get fired."
4,"Jun 16, 2008","Dear BART -You are an enabler. You pick me up near my house and take me drinking. I can always find a cozy bar near your stairs. Many times, you even provide an escalator for my way back down into your welcoming tunnels. You magically arrange for trips home to be much shorter than my trip just a few hours before to the bar.I LOVE your new EZ Rider Fare Card. Now I don't even need to maintain hand-eye coordination, just tap and go.Please do not stop what you are doing no matter what anyone else says. Well, maybe stay up later on the weekends?Love,Shelly L.P.S. I know it's hard to stay healthy and know your line from Hayward to Fremont is ill. I am trying to be understanding. Please feel better soon."

Think of the locker scene in MIB, except not as adorable.  I suggest you stand and NOT place anything on the chairs.  There will be a transfer of organisms if you do so...much like the Mayflower only these organisms aren't looking for religious freedom.Why hasn't there been a movement to change the seats to something more sanitary?  Get rid of the carpet and get rid of the fabric!If it weren't so convenient and fast, I'd love to give this transit system a 1-star review.But it is convenient and still better than the MUNI..."
4,"Jun 3, 2009","Bay Area Rapid Transit aka, BART exceeds MUNI in almost every way. Almost because they are experiencing a gradually worsening cleanliness problem.I'll address that first. The uncleanliness isn't really as much litter from food or drinks, but soiling from you probably don't want to know what. Due to budget constraints, BART has cut back on custodial staffing, thereby exasperating the situation. Their peddling Peet's Coffee at several stations & considering allowing drinks on the trains (provided you use their shoddy, poorly designed ""spill-proof"" mugs) will not help things.On the bright side, BART is mostly on schedule (unlike MUNI, they actually HAVE a schedule, not an ""estimate""). And unlike MUNI, their operators (they don't like the term driver) seem to actually grasp the notion of customer service & convenience. For instance, they try to connect you, ala SF-bound trains waiting for transfers at McArthur Station after direct trains stop running.A MUNI driver will more likely make SURE you do not connect. Seriously. Although BART plans to raise fares yet again, it'll still be cheaper for a tourist (or non Fast Pass holder) tp ride from Embarcadero Station to Civic Center Station after both transit systems' proposed rate increases. Yes, it'll cost more to ride MUNI than BART for the same distance. BART provides their own police who hold full police powers. Some stations along their routes are visual sights. Examples are the SFO  & Millbrae Stations."

3,"Aug 14, 2006","God, where do I start. 1.) I take serious issue with the magnetized ticketing system imposed by BART. While thankfully in the last 5 years they have discovered something known to most of us as a credit card, they are still behind the times. Regular users should get a key chain transponder. No, I'm serious, just like fasTrak you should have an online account and a little thingy that beeps when you walk past. It should be attachable to your keys or purse just to make digging in your bag and therefore exposing yourself to robbery a thing of the past. Also, we could hook it into MUNI and the SF Buses and AC transit. WOW, what a thought! 2.) Bart, I don't care if you list 10 bazillion reasons why you can't run on the weekends late, but whatever they are, they are dumb or a cover for the fact that your union is twisting your arm. Frankly, I think SF cities need to pass a law that says public transportation needs to be open until 3 on Friday and Saturday nights. The fact that people still need to drive after drinking is freaking retarded. Anyone want to start getting signatures? 3.) Your computer system is ridiculous. Who thought of the idea of having a finite number of trains. When you installed the SFO stop, the trains now have to LITERALLY switch over to a new system. Don't you guys plan ahead? I honestly can't believe you didn't think of getting new computers before now. I'm telling you, you pay your drivers too much if this is why. 4.) I am uber annoyed by stupid jerks standing in the way of the doors. I personally like the new marking system you have, but you need to do a better job or clearly stating what travel etiquette is. Also, have some staff at the platforms during rush hour to make Barters behave. I know, police state, but pushing and shoving is just stupid. (You assholes know who you are). 5.) I honestly think 511transit.org trip planner is really really annoying.  Why the heck can't you see where the address of the various Bart tunnels are? A map included in the interactive system would sure be nice. Ever heard of using google? I mean, what if you need a pick up. Or don't know where you are going to be. So dumb that I have to google it. C'mon people! Basic user interfacing."

2,"Sep 3, 2009","My Chicago bias will probably ooze out of this review but I gotta keeps it real. WTF BART? You cost to damn much.  Even though you share the same name as one of my idols growing up (Bart Simpson) I gotta compare you to the CTA in Chi-town which you fall very short of. While your pretty convienient,,and much cleaner than the majority of other mass transit systems your still just a mass transit system. What gives you the right to charge damn near 10 bucks to get me from SFO to the Powell street stop? Why can't you just charge a one time fare and let me ride you until the cows come home. Why do you have to be a public transit snob. BART huh?"
2,"Dec 1, 2009","I will pay more and use BART more regularly, if it gets rid of cloth seating. It's really disgusting. After a friend saw human fecal matter on a seat covered with newspaper, I don't sit, unless I'm in pain or suffering extreme exhaustion. When I do take a seat, I wash my hands and change my clothes as soon as I get home. Granted, I'm a bit sensitive to germs, but the cloth seats and carpets are gross gross gross!BART also needs to invest in building a parking lot for the popular stations in East Bay. I would actually take BART everyday to work, if I could get a monthly parking pass at the nearest BART station. Unfortunately, MacArthur and Rockridge stations are both sold out. Taking a bus to BART isn't really a viable option, since it will add another 20 - 30 min to my commute.I do give  BART credit for extending to Millbrae where Caltrain transfer is possible. Now, if only they could time the transfers better, I would actually be able to transfer. I've had to sprint from BART to Caltrain and nearly miss the Caltrain too many times. If you have to stop and buy a Caltrain ticket or if you are unable to run, then you would surely miss the transfer.It's terribly outdated, but it's still the most reliable and fastest transportation method we have in the Bay Area. How sad."
5,"May 27, 2012",BART: Bad Ass Rapid Transit! I love the BART and it may in fact be the best public transit system in the country. When it reaches San Jose that will be 100% accurate.The people are awesomely diverse and the stations are all in good locations.More BART!
2,"Sep 19, 2019","Since my first BART comment 5 years ago they have made no significant improvement at existing stations that are obviously in need of improvement.  Since BART is losing customers because of these items they say it has their attention. The train is often like a rolling homeless camp,  no improvement.  The stations have very limited security in terms of either security lights or security people, no improvement.  They did a big advertising campaign to say they will crack down on fare evaders, no improvement.  Many regular folks are scared to park and ride at the existing stations so no wonder the customer drop-off.   Of course, this has been a long time with no major action so I am expecting BART will want a tax increase or fare raise to offset their shrinking revenue instead of just getting to work at the stations. I give it a two rating rather than one just because it is still a better option then our miserable freeway situation."
3,"Oct 22, 2014","I am liking the improvement in cleanliness,  but there is still a ways to go.  I have lived in Oakland 35 years and the only rip-off I have encountered has been having a bike stolen from BART stations.  First at West Oakland station, then Rockridge station.  West Oakland is just one stop to the financial district,  Rockridge is full of million dollar homes.  I think BART should have a security guard and cleaning person at all major urban stations like these.  Around the world at major transit stations you see these attendants,  you usually see only one attendant here.  I will be a bit generous and give them a three since the rest of the service seems to be functioning better."
3,"Nov 28, 2013",I have noticed a few more security on the platforms and trains so this is moving in the right direction and I have raised my rating.  However the parking lots need the same attention.  If my local bank who hardly gets any customers can afford a security guard standing outside then BART with all these passengers with money and needs parking in the lots especially at West Oakland station should be able to afford an improvement.  I think a pleasant security guard would bring an increase in business also.

Visit your local BART station around midnight and see how often people get stuck. Talk to your east bay friends and ask why they drove to that bar in the city, knowing they would become intoxicated and have to drive back.Drunk drivers and BART. Connect the dots.If BART needs to close all night ""for maintenance"", then it's time to consider optional maintenance routines. Run less often after midnight, alternate tracks. Run late on Friday and start later on Saturday. Find a solution. 40 years is too long.As a bonus, an adult's hearing is damaged at 85dB. Noise level for children should go no higher than 35dB.

I had just moved to Berkeley and needed to find a way to get to San Francisco everyday for work so that I would stop hearing those voices in my head on the Bay Bridge chanting ""everyone must die"" during my 90 minute commute.  I must admit, you intimidated me at first.  I mean what was I supposed to think when I heard the stories about how you so stealthily move about the dark underground like a massive metal rat, even fearlessly diving deep underwater from time to time without missing a beat!  But after all the time we have spent together I have gotten to know the real you and I wouldn't be a good friend if I didn't make you aware of several major flaws in your seemingly well built system:  1) Your stations smell like urine and feces2) You are not bike friendly 3) Your interior is filthy and disgusting4) You poop out at 12:20, I go all nightAlthough these defects make our relationship a bit rocky from time to time, they won't stop me from sliding my debit card into your waiting slot and gently tapping my private numeric combination onto your slick metal buttons so that I can ride you.  Of course if you really love me you will work on these things.  Because you never know when a better option may come along and sweep me off my feet.  Then my dear BART, you can kiss my ass goodbye - if you're lucky."

(mainly because if you're innocent these days there is really something wrong with you)My sixteenth birthday my bestest friend and I lied to our VERY strict and protective parents and told them we were going to the library.  Instead we went on BART and into the big and dangerous city to watch a movie. Eraser.  Who knew Arnold would be the gubernator? Who new that Vanessa Williams would age so badly?We went back to BART and this man with a duffel bag began to stare at us. He was so creepy....like Chester the Molester creepy.  The train came and we got in.  So did he.  He sat facing us and staring with his bag on his lap. At the next stop I grabbed my friend and we ran off the train and up the escalators to the bathrooms.  We sat in the bathroom for about 15 minutes thinking that he would have left the station when he didn't find us. We got out and were about to go back down onto the platform to go home but then we saw him coming up the escalator. Instead to went to the phones and called my friends older sister.  The guy saw us and stood at the end of the wall and stared at us.  So while we waited for her sister to come we spoke to her whole family on the phone for about 20 minutes.  The WHOLE time getting stared at by the creepy guy with the duffel bag. side note: The BART attendant was NOT intimidating at all.  He was a small indifferent man...I new he wouldn't care if I told him some creepy guy was following us.Her two sisters finally arrive!  They are both tiny women but one came with an industrial screw driver!  She walked RIGHT THROUGH the gate with NO WORD from the BART attendant!  TWO WOMEN with a big ass construction site screwdriver and NOTHING!!  Way to go asshat!!  He did even look our way when she went up to the creepy guy and began to yell at him for harassing two young girls!  This is the creepiest part.  The guy stood there still as stone and just kept staring at the two of us as she yelled at him.  No expression at all. We left and went home.  Scared and hella in trouble. BART still gets five stars because it has served me my entire life.  Even if I did get stalked, hit on, spit on, left behind and stuck in a tunnel on BART...I still love it."

1,"Sep 28, 2011","Ugh, I despise BART.1)  It's DISGUSTING.  The trains are old and ghetto; the cloth seats are revolting and stained and constantly emitting the combined stench of piss, puke, and farts; it appears that nobody ever cleans the damn things.  I just got back from London and rode the Tube there a LOT....so I know that it IS possible to keep cloth seats clean because none of the Tube seats were all that gross.  2)  It doesn't go everywhere in the city.  Just one straight line from the south end to the Embarcadero basically.  So if you want to get to, say, Golden Gate Park, you've gotta think of something else.  I hate public transportation and draw the line at BART, so what other options there are, I don't know.3)  It shuts down too early on the weekends.  It's like they're saying ""Hey guys, how about you drive drunk??""  BART stops running before the bars close.  Maybe that's their lame attempt at reducing puke on the trains, but it sucks because if you miss your train, you're looking at one hell of a hefty taxi fare to get home if you live on the peninsula or something.  A cab ride to my old place in SSF from the city was like $50 -- now that I live in Half Moon Bay, I don't even want to know what that would cost me.4)  Did I mention how gross it is?  I always feel like I need a shower after riding BART.  5)  Seriously, CLEAN THE DAMN TRAINS.[end rant]"
2,"Mar 23, 2011","Man, I have so many complaints about the BART system.  First of, WHY oh WHY are the seats made of CLOTH?!  They stink of bum piss, puke, body odor, etc....so disgusting.  You can see grease-stains on the tops of the seat-backs where dirty people have rested their heads/necks.  They should call it BARF, not BART.  Seriously guys, take a cue from other cities with better public transportation systems -- use plastic seats that are easier to clean and less likely to raise healthy thriving colonies of fecal bacteria!!  Did anyone see that news article about the culture tests they ran on the BART seats?  Absolutely horrifying.  Fecal bacteria is just the beginning of it.Next, the trains are SO LOUD.  I guess there isn't much they can do about that though....right?  I'm not a mechanical engineer so I have no clue.Last, I wish BART ran later, at least on the weekends.  Seriously, anyone who's done the drunken ankle-busting foot-race along Market Street trying to find the one station that's still open so you don't have to cough up $50 for a cab ride to SSF on a Saturday night should feel me on this.  BART has the potential to prevent a LOT of DUI's and drunken-driving attempts if it would operate until say 2:30-3:00am on weekends.  I don't understand why something like that isn't a priority to the city.On the positive side (yes I CAN be objective, sheesh), it's cheap and easy (hey kinda like my sister).  As for the SSF station specifically, it's nice & big and relatively clean.  Easy to navigate, and the parking is pretty convenient.  I got all indignant when they introduced the paid-parking thing, but I've calmed down now after learning that doesn't apply to evenings & weekends.  It's cool."

1,"Jan 6, 2013","Ugh.  Filthy, outdated, stinky, LOUD trains.  And why do they stop running at midnight?  If they ran to 3 am (at least on Fridays and Saturdays), it would cut down on drunk driving, PLUS cut down on cars from the people who work in the nightclubs.  They continue to raise ticket prices while lowering service.  Crazy stinky homeless people are allowed to sleep on the cars.  BART does nothing about it, but why should they?  They know we'll choose them over MUNI.BART's dirty little secret (told to me by my friend who works there): female station agents tend to get raped if they are shutting down the station at night.  BART does nothing about this.  Nice."
3,"Nov 14, 2012","In many ways this San Francisco people mover resembles the L.A. Metro or even the London Underground, except for the fact that riding BART costs more than either of them (especially when you pick up a $5 Metro day pass or utilize a London Oyster card/travelcard, etc). I'm completely lost on why, when traveling in a group, friends will insist on taking the BART into the city, even with a car available. From Millbrae to, say, Embarcadero and back is almost $10. If there are 4 of you, that's $40 to go 16 miles and return. I suppose the one major benefit is not worrying about parking. On the plus side, BART trains are more frequent in coming, they have arrival time estimates posted, and they take you to more distant places than MUNI does. With their ticketing system, you don't have to fumble with getting your card out to show hounding conductors or negotiate with drivers over whether or not you were within the time limit on your transfer. In short, convenient (sometimes), but not cheap."
3,"Jan 23, 2007","Update: I've given BART a few more tries.  It's not so bad.   I'll give it 3 stars cause it's got potential (see closing times).  Plus I know my way around downtown SF a little better now...ok...I know how to get to shopping, food or drink easily from the Montgomery or Powell stations... so it's not so badDon't say I didn't make an effort.  I tried.  I really really tried to like BART.  I tried riding it in different situations and times and places and it just doesn't work.I'm sorry.I'm spoiled.  I grew up in Indiana where there is no public transport then moved to washington DC - home of one of the best systems int he world - and traveled on some of the systems in Europe including Paris, Brussels and London.BART just can't compete.The problems I have:1. Closing hours.  Midnight?  Really?  DC closes later on weekends and Holidays.  That makes sense.2. The weird Richmond/Fremont train closing thing.  I just don't understand it.  Why?  Surely there's a better way of handling it3. The website.  The BART website needs to be fixed.  The directions for loading the maps/schedules onto iPods are completely unclear (at least for me on my Mac).  The trip planner is not intuitive.  If I take bart into the city to a stop I'm probably walking to my destination.  Don't give DRIVING directions.  I walked 5 blocks out of my way tonight because I don't go into the city often and I'm new to town.  5 blocks.  5.  All because BART's directions by mapquest are driving directions and adjust for one way streets.  Gee thanks, but no thanks.Unfortunately, we've now added another car to the roads cause it's going to take a lot to get me to ride BART regularly.....or ever"
1,"Jun 13, 2007","BART, BART, BART. Your weekend East Bay Service sucks. I wake up, scrungy, dehydrated and nauseous.  I scrape myself off the floor of my friends house.  I strap on last nights 3"" stacked wedge heels, adjust my chic tights that have a hole in the knee, collect change from the couch and head towards BART in last nights sequined camisol and black miniskirt. I blink in the early afternoon sunshine. My hair hasn't seen a brush in 22 hours. Nor have my teeth. Since I only have my mini going out bag I have no gum, brush ups, lotion, perfume, emergency flip flops, money or cell phone. I fumble to get my change into the machine to get a ticket.  I wait for 20 minutes for a train to arrive to transport me two stations away to change trains AGAIN.  Everyone is all fresh and farmers market'ed out.  Kids are singing.  Hair is shining. People smell clean with their flowers and baguettes. I can tell some people are on their way home from church. I look like a crack whore. I get off in Oakland. No pervert, in the wheelchair, I don't literally get off at seeing you, talking to you and smelling you.  I wish to god I had sunglasses. 15 minutes later a train f i n a l l y comes into the station to take me to the end of the line where my car is parked. A serious two hour adventure on BART, now has me stuck in random evening traffic all the way home. But at least now I can hide behind giant Oliver Peoples glasses..."
4,"Jan 14, 2010","I like Thomas S's review of Bart:  ""It's like stepping into a time capsule.""  So true!  I swear that some of the trains have not been refurbished or reupholstered since BART started running in the early 70's.  Hence the grease stains on the backs of the seats.  (Why anyone would rest their head on the backs of those seats, I will never know.) I used to take BART into the City when I was in high school to escape suburbia.  Now I still take it to escape suburbia, but I take it to go to work.  I would choose BART over driving to work any day.  I live about a mile from the Concord station so I get a nice walk to & from BART every day.  Sometimes I don't drive for weeks at a time.  After commuting by car for 10+ years I am glad to finally let someone else do the driving.  Just give me my seat by the window so I can gaze outside & listen to Howard Stern.  It's not a bad way to start & end a working day!"
2,"May 23, 2008","Dear BART,I have stood by you, vouching for you, loving you despite your vomit-stained floors, something-gross-stained chairs, shady customers, and your rising prices. I stood by you when I lost my ticket and had to pay another $6 or so in cash to exit the station, asking some poor random guy for a quarter because I had none. I stood by you even though you have that silly ""No food or beverages"" sign. I even stood by you when the dude sitting next to me started jacking off.Now last week, you made me pretty mad. It was your fault too. I know that sometimes your trains catch on fire and what not--they work very hard and all. But I was very troubled when I sleepily opened my eyes on the Richmond--Fremont train and found that I was still in San Leandro though I should be 5 minutes away from Fremont by now. Then I became even more flustered when I looked at the electric sign and saw that I was now on a Richmond train, rather than a Fremont train.I promptly ran out and gave my friends a call, because I would surely be late for our trip to Monterey. Then I found a Fremont train in relief...until you evacuated us at the next stop, forcing us to wait 15 minutes for the next Fremont train while this one turned into a Richmond train, like the last, going the opposite way. Why did you do this? I am just lucky that I realized the train-transformation before I found myself back in Berkeley again. Thank you for lengthening my commute from 50 minutes to an hour and a half. After that experience, I dare not rest my eyes again on your trains.(no there was not a fire that day)From your once loyal customer."
1,"Nov 1, 2018","I don't even know where to begin. There are just many fucked up things about this service that is almost not even worth it. Let's put it this way, if this agency is going to be this shitty, they shouldn't charge money to use it."
1,"Sep 6, 2016","Recently I've taken Dublin/Pleasanton line, and was appalled how dirty the train windows were.  Is it so impossible to hose them once in a while?!  I live in CA and I am aware of the drought and everything - but this ""water saving"" act is unreasonable.  Water use in certain areas must not be compromised.  Moreover, the station lighting is extremely dim - I was riding early morning and literally could not see anything due to the filthy glass and the third world type station lighting.Second - every time I take BART, I cannot believe how expensive the ride is.  How come in Seattle you pay $2.50 for the same or greater distance?  How come BART does not sell discount tickets at the vending machines?  I guess, all my questions are moot but I could not help asking them.  I should be thankful that I do not have to ride it every single day."
1,"Jan 8, 2008","I like BART, actually I love BART, BART has never let me down, 5 stars for BART.What I don't like are the rude people who ride BART.  Don't get me wrong, not all BART patrons are rude, but there are those few who just really tick you off, enough to write a yelp review...So this morning I was on the train and at Rockridge station an elderly woman gets on, and she is seriously old.  I mean, she has thinning white hair, she must have been 75-80 years old.  So she gets on at Rockridge and no one offers her a seat.  I wish I was sitting so I could have given up my seat to her, but alas I was also standing.  First of all the seats by the door are supposed to be given up to seniors and people with disabilities... and just because you have slightly graying hair and are pretending to be asleep does not make it OK for you to make an old lady stand.  And she wanted to sit, I mean she got off at Montgomery but she sat down from Embarcadero to Montgomery...you don't usually sit down for one measly stop.  Stupid young people pretending to sleep and work on their PDAs SUCK!  5 STARS for BART alone.-4 STARS for assholes who don't offer their seats to the elderly."
5,"Jul 20, 2008","We don't have one of these in Seattle and we probably never will..Not in my lifetime, anyway..Instead, we have a street car (the SLUT) that travels a 1.3 mile loop through downtown, at speeds topping out at a whopping 10 miles an hour. Mind blowing, I KNOW! When we do get our 'from downtown to SeaTac and back' train, I pray that it's even 1/16 of what the Bart is..Which would be a 104 mile loop, btw.."
3,"Jan 7, 2011","When I'm visiting a new city, I like to ride the public transit as close to the time I'm entering that city as possible. There's something about the public transit in another city that just screams ""ADVENTURE!""  (Okay, maybe it's more of a mild shriek).As I walked towards the hotel shuttles and cabs, I kept seeing signs for ""BART"". Being that it was my first trip to SF, I had no clue what a BART was. Honestly, all I could think of was The Simpsons. The more sensical part of my brain kept telling me what a ludicrous connection this was. I'm glad I've learned to listen to it.Turns out BART is the Bay Area Rapid Transit system. Walking upto the platform, I read the instructions on how to buy my ticket. Back in Calgary, we have a flat fair to ride. It'll cost you $2.75 CDN to go from one end of the city to the other. Here in SF, it's a different price for each stop. The fares were listed on a printout taped up inside of a page protector next to the electronic ticket booths. My one way ride was $8.10. I'm not going to complain about the price of the C-Train in Calgary anymore.Buying my ticket was a bit of an unusual experience as well. After reading the instructions on requiring a different fair depending on the stop I was headed to, I figured I'd be able to pick my stop, stick my money in, grab my ticket and be on my way. It was almost that simple, but not quite. Instead, after looking up the cost of the fair on the print out, I then had to stick my money in the ticketing machine and change the fair to the appropriate amount using buttons that added or subtracted $1 or $0.05 at a time. It was a little strange. What happens if you don't put in enough money for the stop you're going to? I'm not sure, and I decided I didn't want to find out.Next step, getting on the train. Calgary trains have a button to press to make the doors open. BART trains... don't. So how do you make the silly things open? I tried everything. I touched the door, I jumped on the black space on the platform that the train car doors lined up with (in case it was some new fandangled space age San Fran train that was weight triggered or something). I even waved my arms up and down in front of the door on the off chance that a motion sensor would open the doors. Nothing. Those doors didn't budge. A gentleman behind me tried pushing on the doors. Nothing for him either. The train sat there for another couple of moments. I gave up and resigned myself to the fact that perhaps I had missed my chance to get on this one (I had bought my ticket after it pulled up after all). Thirty seconds later, the doors opened on their own. After I got on the train and got myself settled, I opened up the map I had grabbed before buying my ticket. Looking at it now, I figured out where I'd need to get off the train to switch over to another train to get to the right stop for my hotel. See, the train I got on was part of the yellow line. The map showed three other lines, and the stop I wanted resided on the red line. I looked closely at my map and saw four white dots all in a row on each line at Balboa. This must be where all four tracks coincide. I would get off there and switch over to the red track.As we pulled into the Daly City station, the operator made an announcement that anyone wishing to switch trains should do so at this station! What?? But it didn't have any white dots on the map! Maybe that didn't matter? I thought it wiser to listen to him and got off the train. I headed for the exit to go find the platform for the red track. I ended up on the platform on the other side, trains on this side were headed back in the direction I came from. Confused, I retraced my steps down the stairs and happened upon the information desk. ""Excuse me, what train will take me to Powell Station?"" I asked the desk attendant. ""Anyone on that side"" she replied as she pointed to the platform I had been on in the first place. Turns out I had pictured a much bigger and more intricate train system than what existed. Sure there are four lines, but there are only two sets of rails. Go figure.BART, your doors and your map tricked me. But your attendant was helpful, and you provided me with my first experience of San Francisco. Not all cities have the benefit of a train that can take you all the way to the airport for under $10, nor does the acronym for their transit system flow so nicely into a one syllable name. We had our ups and downs on that first ride, but overall, you're not so bad."
3,"Sep 2, 2011","I will have to agree with many of the reviews... I personally commute to San Francisco and can vouch for these topics of interest... The negatives... 1. Cleanliness should be increased. No one likes the smell of urine. 2. More trains should run from 7-9am and 4:30-6:30pm... 15 minutes is too long to wait for a train... 3. talk about robbery... $$$ Its far too expensive to be crammed on a train car like cattle for 35 minutes... An the sad part is BART talks about raises prices... 4. Weekends should have trains running past midnight, it would promote less drunk driving and bring more people into the City... The positives... 1. You can avoid traffic and the extra time it would consume in your day... 2. You don't have to pay the high prices of city parking ;) 3. more environmentally friendly 4. If you are a people watcher, there is quite a show! (wear sunglasses) A few other side notes... some BART locations are now charging $1 for parking, which is unfortunate... And some locations are definitely safer than others... so be aware of your surroundings. (or where you are parking your car)"
3,"Nov 23, 2009","Mi espanol no es bueno. Una amiga de Mexico estaba aqui and ella quiere ir a museo en Oakland.Yes, one of my most admired friends came up specifically to visit me and wanted to check out an exhibit at the Oakland Museum. It was the last weekend that the exhibit would be on display so we made plans on Sunday to take a trip out. She had booked a room in the City and I had planned to drive there, but she being the ""eco-friendly"" friend wanted to take public transportation. I admit, I am not the best at knowing the how's and what's of our local public transportation systems. But I do know we have something called BART.The Embarcadero station was a few steps away from her hotel and the pay stations were easy to figure out. My friend was a but upset that they didnt give you change in pesos, but I explained to her that our currency has been battered by the global economy and any exposure that we get these days is much needed.That BART tube is kind of trippy and made a wooooshing sound which I thought was cool. Worthy of 2 stars alone.Easy, not very clean but clean enough for me and convenient."
1,"Dec 8, 2012","Now I shall complain about parking. I haven't taken Bart in awhile but the other day I had to go into the city for an interview. I left an hour early and decided Daly City Bart was the best form of transportation to the Financial District on a Thursday afternoon. WRONG.I circled EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEIR PARKING LOTS...TWICE. What did I find? No empty parking lots that's for sure. I did, however, find two to three floors of ""reserved"" spots which happened to be all EMPTY. Who are these spots reserved for?? Because no one sure as hell parks in them.Long story short, I ended up driving to the city and made it to my interview on time. Yay me."
2,"Nov 25, 2011","I just wanted to add that some of the Bart employees are not very friendly. Exhibit A: The convo. I had earlier with one of the Bart attendants. I had $2.50 left on a previous Bart ticket from awhile back that was stamped, ""See Bart Attendant."" Okay, so I walked up to one of the attendants in the glass box.Bart attendant: ""Yes?""Me: ""Hi =] I wanted to use up this ticket, but it says see attendant first.""Bart attendant: *sigh* [grabs ticket, doodles on it]Me: ""I understand it's not enough fair so should I add onto it now?""Bart attendant: ""You add to it when you get to your destination!!!"" *looking at me like, DUH!* ""Here's your ticket go through.""Me: ""Oh okay thanks.""So I try going through, but it spit the ticket back out. So I walk back over to the lady.Me: ""Hi again, it didn't work.""Bart attendant: *Rolls eyes and grabs ticket in frustration* ""Try it again......""Me: *Fake smile on my face* ""............Ok.""It worked this time around but geez. I felt like I was making her night horrible since she was sitting in one spot and had to roll her chair over to another to press a button for me. Some peoples lives are just so hard."
2,"Nov 23, 2011","Yes Bart is fast, easy, convenient, and cheap.It also is dirty and ranks of homeless peoples urine.I use to take Bart all the time for work and I was so tired of constantly feeling as if I needed to use my antibacterial hand lotion. Which I did. I don't care for the people who take Bart. I've witnessed a lot of people with attitudes who think their shit doesn't stink pick on older couples and the elderly. They're lucky I didn't go Chuck Norris on their asses."
2,"Apr 12, 2017","Drives me crazy to see Bart police hanging out with station agents in the morning and then I have to get on a train half filled with homeless people taking up seats from paying customers. I board at the Pittsburg station and trains go off line for about 10mins before turning around. During that turn around time it's wouldn't take much to walk the train and kick them off. I've been told by Bart, it's a ""regional problem"", just seem nothing is being done and it's frustrating."
3,"Nov 14, 2006","Bart is my most-oft-used magical transport to downtown SF, because I'm only 4 blocks away from it, it's speedy, and it's more reliable than MUNI.I also love that I can take it to SFO and OAK when I need to fly fly away.Also, you don't need to carry cash on you all the time (Exact-F'ing-Change MUNI bastards say what?), which is awesome.But...Some total dumb-ass decided that trains should stop running around 12:30am.  This is the most idiotic, poorly conceived, anti-public-safety shit ever.  12:30 is early enough that pretty much noone is going to plan to take bart home after going out drinking, which means anyone who isn't local to where they're drinking is going to drive home.  Drunk.This is idiotic.If they only pushed the schedule back so that the last trains left SF at, say, 2am, I'm willing to bet there'd be a significant reduction in the number of drunk drivers.  How hard could this really be?It's also really loud, especially in the tunnels.  I'd be curious to know if daily bart riders experience hearing degredation over time because of it.  (sidenote: noise cancelling headphones are awesome)"
2,"Feb 7, 2010","Yesterday morning, on my way to work, I randomly spoke to a New Yorker on the BART who'd just landed at SFO and was trying to figure out what stop we were at, and I suddenly remembered my initial bewilderment when I first started using it; I had a lot of trouble trying to figure out where I was.The fact that the stations are quite dark, which makes it difficult to see the signs informing you where you are from inside the trains is bad enough, but add to that the apparent refusal of the drivers to tell you what station you're at whenever the train stops, and it explains completely her, and my, total (initial) confusion.On top of this, who thought it was a good idea to have *carpets* on public transport? The filthy stains at the back of each carriage lend themselves to the explanation of their own existence. The off-white interior just *feels* dirty, and the architecture of the entire system seems like a horribly, unmodern throwback to the 70s.The frequent delays, the horrendous schedule (seriously, do I really have to wait 15 minutes at a little past 6pm?) combined with the general dark and dank feel, it's hardly the experience you'd want from a post-2000 transport system.It gets you where you need to go (providing that you want to get to somewhere along that one line straight through the city), but you certainly won't enjoy the ride."
4,"Jun 14, 2007","I don't know why people complain. Without it, you won't get anywhere. You will need a car, need to pay car insurance, car payment, and gas which is cost more than a gallon milk now. What's the problem? I took it today almost all day, it saved me gas, time, parking, and irritation when I drive in heavy traffic. Things to enjoy, sit there, read a book, magazine, listen to music, chat with friends and relax. Nothing to worry about except getting on the right Bart or leaving at the right stop.  You don't get this spoiled in every city, so don't badger it.Where can you go for $3.75? Answer: SF to Downtown Berkeley."

Then I hate you because you end your service at the dumb-dumb time of twelve or so, cause me to stay stuck in the East Bay and never romp till late night in the city unless i or another friend drives.Then I love your cushy seats and and all the fantabulous people watching- because, well, everyone rides BART.But I hate you, because everyone rides BART and during high traffic times I'm smashed into one of your cars like a freaky clown sardine.Sunny days = loves (sunny, relaxing, half naked hot people)rainy day = hate (smells, wet, cranky people)late night service = loves (awesome for holidays!)late night service = hate (never happens- except for once or twice a year...every plastered person in the Bay Area crammed on BART)What am i going to do with you BART?"
5,"Jun 19, 2008","Maybe I'm not the best person to gauge public transit because I grew up in LA and don't remember my 2.5 years in NYC, but consider this:1) It usually shows up on time2) $5.35 one-way to SFO from SF vs. ~$40 via cab3) Stations are relatively clean compared to most places4) Trains are comfortable 5) The ookiness I feel knowing when I'm hundreds of feet below the bay in the Transbay TubeGranted, it stops a little too early and maybe compared to NYC it doesn't compare in terms of convenience, but compared to most places SF has it good in terms of public transportation.  My only real complaint is that they never did extend it down Geary into Marin County."

My muni fast pass allows me to take you around in just the city, which I appreciate very much. Plus when I need a break from the crazies on the Muni system, you offer me peace and quiet. My sensitive ears are still adjusting to your speed & sounds, but I haven't had one bitter experience. I can't wait for revamped seats & floors. I LOVE YOU BART"
3,"Oct 2, 2007","I ride BART every day.  And this is what I can say: they do an entirely okay job.  They could use more trains during peak hours.  They could stay open all night long (all niiiiiiiight, all night long).  The trains could be cleaner.  The stations could be cleaner.  BART employees could act as though they gave a shit about anything.  BART could let people with bikes on before 6 pm (they let people with strollers and screaming crotch fruit on at all hours, and they take up at least as much room).  And BART could sure as hell make sure that the escalators always run UP.  No one needs a DOWN escalator, BART.Prices are quite reasonable, at least for people who can use the FastPass."

Now if only they would have expanded into San Jose like they intended to..."
3,"Oct 10, 2015","Any public transportation in a complex city is a good thing.  The BART has been around for years and expanded.  Because it has SF airport and Oakland airport on its line, it really makes it idea for travelers to take.  Parking is difficult and expensive in SF.  So the BART option is really a good one.  I understand the frustration with price and time with the system. Having used the Washington D.C. metro system (which copied BART), I see the need of such system.  Perhaps if I lived here, I wouldn't like the price.  But as a visitor, it is the best way to go.  Don't be influence by the bad reviews.  It is safe and convinient."
2,"Mar 8, 2009","Really a 2.5er, but I got to drop a star for their recent renovation. When are cloth seats acceptable for mass transit? They're not. They recently renovated many of their trains and had the brains to rip out the nasty-ass carpet, so why keep the cloth seats? Of course the trains still stink. Take a lesson form the NYC MTA, London's Tube and  Paris' Metro: these people-movers have one thing in common: plastic bench seating. Why would a brash upstart like BART try to reinvent the light rail? And then to charge what they charge is pretty weak. Why does it stop running at midnight on weekends? Are they in cahoots with the Taxi association or do they think that it's a good thing for people to drive across the bridge buzzed? One train per hour from Civic Center to 12th Street would maybe save a few live every year. That's a good thing. I'm going to try AC Transit for a few weeks and see how it compares to my old stand by, BART."
3,"Mar 18, 2008","Yay to BART for getting me to OAK airport and downtown SF without having to fight for parking. And I like that my local BART station does NOT charge parking. My condolences to those of you who do have to pay. Boo to the fact that it can be pretty pricey, crowded during peak hours, and the dirty, smelly cars. Plus some riders look sketchy. I had an experience where this guy took a seat directly behind me. And maybe he had Tourette's or something but I highly doubt that - out of nowhere he screamed at the top of his lungs: ""&%# YOU! I MEAN IT!"" Everyone on the car just looked up. He got off at the same stop as me. Yikes! That's public transportation for you."
4,"Apr 17, 2007","I'm a fan of Bart.  As an exMuni-train commuter I've come to appreciate BART - it's regularity, it's orderly lines and soft seats.  So much so that my car sits lonely and dusty on the street.  Happiness to me is letting BART deal with driving, while I read a book.  That being said, to get BART up to 5 stars, here are 5 rules fellow riders need to stick to:1. Walk left, stand right!   If you want to treat the escalator as a ride or are too lazy to walk (I am guilty of this), stand to your right.  Don't block those people running for their trains to get to work on time.2. Have your ticket out as you approach the 'turn-styles.'  You had to put the ticket into the slot to get into BART, what did you think was going to happen when you got off the train?  Don't clog up a gate while you fumble for your ticket either.  You risk getting crushed to death by the ever forward moving throng.  That or just really irritating the person stuck behind yee of the short sight.  3.  Don't have loud cell phone conversations for all to hear, and for the love of god can you get a less obnoxious ring-tone!  I don't need to hear the intimate details of your life, nor do the people in the next train.  I'm sorry you have that outbreak but I hear they have a cream for it.

They might be lonely.5.  Don't hold the doors open.  BART is sensitive, it likes to breakdown.  If you hold the door open and knock my train out of service I'm going to give you...well a really evil eye at the least (OK the most)  Although, watching people getting crushed in the doors is a personal favorite BART pastime of mine.  Cruel but hilarious."
2,"Jul 4, 2013","I tolerated my BART commute, slightly better than driving. Some stinky, dirty cars, with an occasional mental wandering/in the car, cars with heaters on hot days, and air conditioners on cold days. Escalator set in the wrong direction for commutes, when they are working. Stiles not set to easy commutes. I'll give them that they are no worse than other public transport. The best thing I could say, is that it is mostly on time.But now, the entitled BART workers are on strike, devastating the daily schedules of hundreds of thousands of people, and costing local businesses millions of dollars. It's as if there had been a terrorist attack shutting down the region's transport, I'm not equating BART workers to being terrorist. No, I'm equating the damage they are causing.Why are they allowed to strike? Why aren't they all fired for wasting the public's time and causing this much financial damage?They're seeking raises? Not willing to pay more for their benefits (like people do in jobs now)?Instead they are holding the public hostage. In a hostage situation, do you give in to the hostage takers, so they can do this to you again?"
1,"May 21, 2018","I have been riding BART for almost 40 years. Let me tell you how nasty it really is, and getting worse. Over the past year I have had to tolerate riders who deliberately use up the seats for the disabled, pee and crap while on the train, vomit on the train.  I have seen tearful women wonder if their partners have died on the train from drug use, and have personally wondered several times if riders are having an actual overdose in front of my eyes.  My family member once slipped on vomit at the station itself.  I have also seen seats taken up for large pieces of luggage. Nice, eh?  And this is over just one yeaToday 5/4 was the nastiest. Going in to the city there were 3 drugged out people taking up 3 seats, 2 seats were broken and the inner cushions ripped out, the car smelled to high heaven and as we stepped off the car at Civic Center a fellow was actively shooting up sitting on the floor against the pillars trying to access a vein that was pretty much gone already. Ironically we past the sign that says ""no eating, drinking, vaping, graffiti.""  WowOn the return trip 3 guys got on with cell phones talking loudly about when their next drug deal was going down,, took up the disabled seats, ignored an elderly couple with a cane who were clearly in need of these seats, then these guys got up and continued fanning out in the seats looking over other people's shoulders, changing placesThis round trip today was it for me so I write this reviewOnly one time in my history of riding BART have I seen BART police, 5 minutes after a violent crime began!!!!!!!!!!  I watched it unfoldI have been on public transportation much of my life but nothing like this and I grew up using the NY subwayI promise this is the God's honest truthThe exposure to crime and the dangers of exposure to biohazards has reached ridiculous proportionsWhere is BART police to help protect other law abiding riders?

Please be more visible!Update:  today 5/20 I watched CBS news and it reported some wonderful public citizen videotaped the Civic Center BART station at 6:30 am and the hallway was filled to the max with folks shooting up. More than a million dollars has been allotted to add more officers and cleaners. This is great to hear. They also showed 2 BART police officers trying to clear a hallway. It appears this was not at the same time as the citizen's video. I had to laugh. I have never seen a police presence at BART where the trains are and now this. A huge thanks to this one citizen who had it. We all need to do this. This is a huge public safety issue. Even just 1 cop where the trains load or unload at the notorious stations only would help. If I begin to see any police presence I will happily write a positive review. Until then I remain doubtful"

4,"Jun 10, 2011","If you get a chance, not that you will, but take a look at the reviews for Philadelphia's SEPTA (which ironically sounds like septic and, well, that reminds me of shit) and then take a look back at the BART reviews. There's a huge disconnect in city transportation developers between Philadelphia and San Francisco, but major kudos to the Bay Area for getting it right.The cost to ride is a little on the steep side, but we used it fairly infrequently on our visit. Given that we mostly walked to and from the hotel to all of our touristy destinations, we took the bus more often than rail, but it served us just fine. Schedules were easy to read, the ride was smooth and clean, and figuring out how to get from point A to point B was a virtual no-brainer. For being public transportation it far exceeded any expectations I have ever had for big city travel."
3,"Aug 9, 2008","BART is showing it's age - but hey, it can't be beat in getting into SF, avoiding parking hassles and paying outrageous parking fees.It gets really crowded during rush hour, the ventilation doesn't always work, and there are delays. The noise while riding in the cars can get deafening at times. Finding parking in the parking structures can sometimes be hard (especially in the Daly City or Fremont BART stations).Thank goodness I don't have to rely on BART for my commute - but in these days high gas prices, I won't hesitate in taking BART to SF."
2,"Apr 27, 2011","I take Bart on a daily basis and its never a pleasant experience. Its devastating, but I've chose to deal with it. During the several months that I have taken bart, I have seen, heard, and smelled weird things. Today for instance, some person almost sat on me. I have also seen fights, people picking their nose, as well as the homeless panhandling for a cheese burger. Yea, you'll definitely find yourself exposed to awkward, uncomfortable, and strange situations on Bart - without a doubt! The trains are filthy, musty, and germ infested. It's really gross and I'm hoping I don't die from some foreign disease cultivated in those trains. The seats are stained with God knows what, the floors are sticky, and there's always trash tucked along the sides of the seat. They obviously do not spend enough money maintaining the trains or enforcing their ""no food or drink"" rule. Their sliding doors do not stay open for anyone, so beware because I've seen the doors shut on people as they try to slide through, it doesn't open back up like elevator doors, it just squeezes you until you get out of the way. Every aspect of Bart is yucky, but I've learned to accept it, which is why I wear the same ugly jackets all the time, which gets washed every Friday. Bart really deters me from buying new clothes; I mean what's the point? It will just get ruined. Everyday, twice a day, I sit in an awkward position making sure that I don't touch any foreign objects and that my hair doesn't touch the seats. I then go home and take a shower within minutes!! I'm really not a germaphobe but, bart conditions are far from acceptable. Others will probably argue against me, as I have seen people sleep comfortably on the seats, in the fetal position, occupying two seats at once while an elder has to stand!!!!!!!!!"
2,"Oct 13, 2015","Sure...it gets you from Point A to Point B and serves people without other transportation options. But its a bad experience that absolutely pales in comparison to mass transit system in major cities around the world.  BART is a poorly planned linear system that leaves populated areas of the Bay Area poorly served.  There aren't enough cars to provide service even as it is due to BART's poorly managed financial condition and the cars on the track are generally very overcrowded.  The trains itself sound like they are about to fall apart as they rattle down the ancient tracks and the interiors are filthy and appear to go uncleaned for months.  Windows, seats, floors are all dirty and stained.    The stations are for the most part are dirty, depressing concrete monoliths that reflect the institutional, unimaginative utilitarian architecture of the late 1960s and early 1970s.  Many stations and parking lots are dangerous after dark.  Worst of all, BART management seeks to stick taxpayers with new taxes to operate the system in 2016.  Meanwhile, BART will not seek to tax corporations and real estate owners whose property values skyrocketed when BART stations were constructed near their property.  Such assessments are perfectly legal to do under California law and many mass transit systems around the globe provide funding this way.  This funding failure has been studied by planning and transportation professors at UC Berkeley and reported in this article....http://www.eastbayexpress.com/oakland/barts-big-gift-to-wealthy-corporations/Content?oid=3654041BART/mass transit is a public good.  But this is a system designed to barely get by, which it is."
1,"Sep 13, 2013","How about riding inside a 5 day urine infested, 4 homeless panhandling trains at 6am! These guys keep raising fares and fighting over more money/benefits while allowing the trains to become public restrooms and homeless haven! Please focus on buying PINESOL. At least the pine smell will cover up the urine smell on these trains."
2,"Jun 3, 2019","Some of the rudest train oprators in the country work here.They can be unabashedly nasty over the PA.  BART does not enforce their own rules--such as related to bringing bikes on crowded trains, the car interiors are dirty and not well maintained.l, and rain can cause system-wide delays."
3,"Oct 14, 2012","Where can they improve?For starters they can have more BART police on the trains (despite their bad rap) it would certainly minimize the amount of homeless people who get on the trains, take up and entire seat because they need a nap, stink up the cars,  take a shit on the seats, and have entire LOUD arguments with people only they can see, disrupting everyone's ride.Maybe having an entire car reserved only for people with bikes, so they are not taking up space on the trains with their bikes while the train is crowded. Guess what BART? Restricting them to certain times of day is not helping. DEDICATE A WHOLE CAR TO THEM, THEY'RE GETTING ON MY NERVES WITH ALL THE SPACE THEY TAKE UP.Us BART riders can complain and complain until our faces turn colors, however, the simple fact is that we need it, AND we will keep riding it. I don't think BART really cares if you have a good experience or not, as long as a) your not suing them and b) you keep giving them your money. PLAIN AND SIMPLE."
3,"Apr 11, 2013","Sure the BART is old, dirty, and sometimes stinky, but it's is a pretty convenient, cheap, and fast way to travel around the Bay Area. I usually take the BART from the SFO airport into downtown San Francisco which takes about 40 minutes which currently costs $8.25. It is definitely a much cheaper alternative to renting a car and paying sky high parking fees."
5,"Jan 17, 2008","I heart you BART...I have never owned a car, and you continue to reinforce that decision.  I can visit my Gramma in Lafayette (I could visit my other Grandma in Pleasanton, but she never invites me over...) my sister in Pleasant Hill, my friends in Berkeley, get to City College to go to class...and visit Lake Merritt to take a famed gondola ride...Its a great place to people watch, read, snooze (although, I always feel a little sketched by sleeping on public transit...it usually is an accident if it happens), play sudoku, gather my thoughts, etc, etc...I wish you would replace Cal-Train, and also go to the North Bay though...that would be AWESOME!*I've always wondered why the isles are carpeted..."
2,"Aug 30, 2008","I wanted to write this review to profess my undying hatred for BART. Most days.Some days, BART is great and takes you to where you want to be, without a problem. Many days, bart is horrible and cannot take you to where you want to be as quick as you want to get there, for a myriad of stupid reasons. These usually include: 1. ""We are experiencing problems with the train/track and will have to wait an eternity on the track until some idiot figures out what happened.""2. ""The train in front of us has a locked axle and we have to wait until some idiot figures out what happened and unlocks the axle. Hopefully he won't touch the electric third rail and electrocute himself in the process, but if he does, we'll have to wait an additional 30 minutes.""3. ""The train conductor wants to grab a sandwich at the nearby shop at the next station, so until he has some hot pastrami in his hands, we will not be leaving the station.""4. Green fairies are flying around in the front of the train, and we don't want to hit them and stop the magic in this world, so we will be sitting on the tracks for another 10 minutes.5. We need to re-route the train because some hippie event is going on, and we don't want to hit the hippies.Bay area rapid transit? I've always thought it should be something more like Bay area Retarded transit. Or Bay area Ridiculous transit. Bart is incredibly unreliable, so don't count on getting anywhere on time if you take it. Don't get me wrong, many days, you'll get to exactly where you want to be, when you want to get there, and bart is a glorious experience. But on those days where the fairies are partying in the middle of the tracks, well, you'll just have to go with the attitude, ""I'll get there when I get there."" And, ""the fairies are just as important as I am."""
4,"Nov 16, 2010","I really appreciate the ease and convenience of BART.  As somebody who doesn't live in the city but visits frequently, I always have a really easy time getting around.  I can get right to downtown from SFO in roughly a half hour, and I can get from downtown to Berkeley for a football game in roughly the same amount of time.  For tourists like myself, BART just makes getting in and out of the city so easy.  My only minor complaints or issues:  Cloth seats, just gross, unless you get a newish car, this can;t be a good idea on rainy days when the seats stay wet all day.  Why are there only 4-5 stops in downtown?  I know the line wraps through the city but there are so many neighborhoods with no subway access and nothing near Golden Gate Park.  These issues are hardly enough to outweigh the amazing positives of BART."
2,"Jun 16, 2012","BART is... weird. It was originally conceived as a ""train of the future,"" and it does have that sort of futuristic glean to it, with the huge oddly-shaped broad-guage railcars and the strange whirring and grinding noises it makes. It's also very zippy for a US subway system.Then there are these surprising moments of un-modernness, like the lack of automated announcements or LED signs onboard. These trains of the future still have conductors making barely comprehensible announcements. (D.C.'s Metro, which is probably the most similar system to BART, suffers this perplexing anachronism as well.) And man, BART has by far the grossest, filthiest railcar interiors I've ever seen. Those seats! My god, those seats. And the carpeting too (also: carpeting on public transit... really??), which is probably releasing mutant mold spores with every step. It looks like it hasn't been cleaned in at least decade, and the cars smell like--and I'm trying to be kind here--a golden retriever that has just emerged from a swamp. All you want to do is bathe in bleach after you've sat down on one of those things. Nasty, nasty. Odd though, because the stations are actually pretty nice and well-maintained. Not as nice: those farecard vending machines, which actually manage to be more confusing than even Chicago's. Isn't SF supposed to be the technology city? Aren't there any user interface designers that can help out? The thing is, BART wouldn't be too hard to make actually really nice. New seats, new vending machines, and some better signage. Oh, and cheaper tickets (yeah, right.)"
1,"May 26, 2019",The WORST train system in the country! PERIOD! The trains are overrun with homeless. Their train schedule is a true joke. Always changing ane trains are constantly LATE! Sadly they are the only thing we have. The whole system top to bottom is getting worse and they are and will continue to lose patrons. We get less for our dollars from BART every year. The whole BART board should be fired. The whole system is a bad joke. And no ones laughing...
3,"Sep 14, 2009","Being a Boston girl, I appreciate public transportation and using the BART in SF is no different for me. It's clean, fast, and on time, what more can I ask for? It lost a star because I'm not fond of their vending machines to get my tickets. It was rather confusing and it didn't tell me how much it cost to get to a certain location. THEN it costs a lot! what's that all about?"
3,"Feb 25, 2015","I don't know why people complain so much about BART! It helps people travel where they need to go pretty much anywhere in the Bay (looking forward to the San Jose extension) at a relatively low cost. I take BART into the city from the East Bay all the time and it's great because I don't have to worry about driving or parking. Sure it can be a little grimey and sketchy at times, but it gets ya where you need to go."
5,"Nov 4, 2009","You know, a lot of times, I feel like public transportation gets the shit end of the stick. All the faults are constantly pointed out and all the good qualities are over-looked.I am from Chicago, where we have a heavily train-based public transportation system. It's good, but it still has it's issues.Now...I was very, very impressed with the BART. You basically get to sit in fucking Lazy Boy chairs, you have notices in the station of when the next train is coming, there's very few  delays and everything is well marked.It's a little pricey to get around (it's a pay system that you pay more the farther you go, instead of a flat rate, like Chicago), but man, it's a nice system."
4,"Sep 10, 2007","Dear BART,I love you and I miss you. Please come to Austin.Sincerely,MeredithPS - Could you bring the price down a tad and stop making me wait so long when I miss the train?PPS - The crazy people who semi-assault me (and others) in the stations are a bit of a concern."
3,"Jul 5, 2009","BART is great. I'm on it everyday on my commute to work. Fast and efficient -- more or less on time (unlike its evil brother, MUNI). The electronic passes were an improvement, but why isn't there anything more similar to a fastpass? (I guess MUNI does do somethings right...) Also what the hell is this about shutting down at midnight. THIS IS A WORLD CLASS CITY FOR CHRIST SAKE. This is why people get DUIs! *cough*"
3,"Dec 10, 2009","I thought I was supposed to relax when taking public transportation. Such worries like parking, driving, and gas dissolve away when using BART, however, these worries are replaced by many others. Public transportation these days feels like a gamble. There have been a good number of well publicized incidents including bus crashes, police using excessive force, and the recent Muni stabbing along with the BART train derailing. Additionally BART fees have been hiked up and parking enforced until 4PM. With current headlines terrorizing my consciousness and additional fees leeching my wallet, I still apprehensively take BART as a good alternative to the four wheeler.BART wish list:-Replacing all the fabric seats and flooring with the NYC subway type design. All those stains do not add a vintage charm.-I heard they were testing free wifi on BART? Is this ready to go yet?-Do something about the San Francisco tunnel noise. It's friggin' loud!-The new BART website is a visual improvement but it's still not perfect.-More localized places to offer BART tickets?-More security onboard trains especially during the holidays."
3,"Feb 13, 2009","BART,Please contact Billy Mays for a large purchase of Oxy Clean, immediately.  Some of your seats are repulsive and a mystery stain follow me home.Please, I beg of you, call Billy."
1,"Jun 9, 2009","OK, so BART gets me from A to B. If there wasn't BART we would be stuck paying toll and in hours of traffic trying to cross into San Francisco. However, can BART get its act together and clean up a bit??? I have seen bugs, smelled piss, body odor, and bad breath among other things. When I first started commuting into San Francisco I kept getting sick. When I narrowed it down BART was the culprit. Tip: Bring hand sanitizer with you when you ride BART so that you can at least sanitize your hands after a ride.  At least wash your hands directly after a trip to stop the spread of germs. I believe that BART should not have carpet or cloth seats. Cloth seats and carpet are ludicrous. They are absolutely filthy, gunky and germ infested. I think linoleum floor and plastic seats would be a good idea so that they can be hosed down on a daily basis. Oh and people do NOT follow the no-eating rules -food bits and stains all over the place. In general there are a few dirt-bag BART riders that ruin it for us all. Additionally, many people blare their stupid music super loud or talk on their cell phones with the volume up so damn loud that you can hear the other person on the line. BART can you please regulate the people going from train to train asking for money? Rude BART riders can you please let old men and women and pregnant ladies have a damn seat? GOSH! I have to ride BART to get to and from work. If there was another convenient option I would absolutely take it!"

1,"Feb 18, 2011","You can say that it is better than NYC, but it still sucks. Too few trains, too few cars, and too many idiots running the show. I had a 2 hr delay because of ""equipment trouble"". And after service resumed, they ran four trains in a row going to the same destination (the 2-4th trains were empty of course) while everyone waiting to go anywhere else had to wait for over 30min more to have one of their trains arrive. I guess that once service resumed, the operators were so relieved that they stopped doing their jobs. They should be fired and so should their managers for having their heads up their asses.Can I get a 'no' vote on their next budget request that just will line the pockets of these incompetent public servants and their union lawyers?You suck BART!!!"
4,"Apr 14, 2011","I love BART.It's ALWAYS on time (unlike caltrain)... and it's reasonably cheap. It's very easy to understand how the schedule and routes work... You can take Bart around the city all the way down to Milbrae, where Caltrain takes it from there if you continue heading south, and it also can bring you to SFO, Richmond, Berkeley, Concord, Oakland, Fremont, and so forth. Beats traffic anytime!In reality, BART is pretty gross. It's quite efficient with getting you to Point A to B or even to C, but there are stains on the seats from god knows what... I don't get why they even bothered putting in FABRIC seating in a mass public transit that I'm sure millions of people use? Not very thoughtful if you ask me. I don't get why they can't just replace it soon because it needs it (or at least plastic coverings?). Other than the nasty facts, its pretty comfortable if you don't think of it too much. Just go home and take a nice hot shower and scrub your booty clean because you know those seats are NASTY.Safety? I've never had trouble on BART.. Seems safe!. I could say something ABOUT MUNI'S SAFETY... But this is my review for BART and BART only. =PI tend to fall asleep in BART because of the ""oOooOooHHhoOOOHHHHHHWoooooooooooOoooo"" sounds it makes when running. Hahaha, yes it's strange how it comforts me after a long day of work. Does anyone else get sleepy from this too? Is it just me?"
1,"May 13, 2019","I took Bart yesterday from Dublin to Powell and back. We had to transfer at 12th st due to maintenance.  Th 12th  Street station was filthy with urine. There was an an angry ranting person on the platform  at Powell. There was another angry ranting person on the platform at twelfth coming back. There were seriously shady characters on the train. I would never let my 20 year old beautiful daughter take that train alone on a weekend late afternoon. She would be in serious danger. I will avoid the weekends myself whenever I can. I used to love Bart, but not anymore."
4,"Jul 9, 2009","BART is like a secret lover.  It shows up on time, moves quickly and doesn't hesitate to leave when the business is done.  Sure it's dirty, loud and has been ridden a few times before, but that just adds to the excitement, doesn't it?An hour and a half of my workday is spent in the tunnels and elevated tracks of the BART system.  Without it, I am stuck on the roads, a slave to the pace and gridlock of the Bay freeways.  With it, I know exactly what time I will be where, and that gives me peace of mind.  I can read the paper, play Rolando, scribble Yelp reviews, sleep.  There are so many options.Pay no attention to the detractors, they are not BART locals, they are BART tourists.  This system is reliable, competitively priced and unequaled in California.  It is the only thing that allows me to live in San Francisco while maintaining a job in an East Bay suburban nightmare they call a city.  And anything that allows me to live in San Francisco is deserving of unlimited praise."
3,"Jun 19, 2014","BART, clean up your act!  Trim your upper management and hire cleaners who actually clean.  Enforce the animal, food/drink, and fare-evasion rules.  Too many animals on BART.  The two- and four-legged varieties.  No, that dog is NOT a service animal.  It's a pet.  And you can't bring those on BART.A pit bull took a dump on the escalator the other day at one of the downtown stations.  The owner acted as if nothing was happening and made no attempt to clean it up.Trash is constantly being thrown on platforms and on cars.  People dig into their KFC and throw the bones on the floor.  They wolf down a burrito and wipe their hands on the seats.  The leave their half-finished big gulp on the floor where eventually it falls over and soaks into the carpet.  A general layer of scum has accumulated on every surface.  The stations and cars need about triple the attention they're getting today."
4,"Apr 20, 2011","BART does a great job of getting people to and from their destinations, very nearly flawlessly.  And the price can't be beat, especially with gas headed toward $5 a gallon.One star deduction for the general unkempt condition of the cars.  I can still remember when BART had pristine carpeting and fresh seat covers in every car.  But back in those days, they enforced the ""no food or drink on BART"" rule.  Most of the mess on BART is due to customers throwing or dropping things on the floors and seats.  So a combination of better rule enforcement and better cleaning is in order.  For all the people who knock off stars because public transit was late, consider that all forms of transportation (including driving) are subject to delays.  If you get in a car and head off toward a bridge, you may very well encounter slowdowns or unforeseen traffic jams.  People jump in front of BART trains (they euphemistically call those ""Medical Emergencies"").  Think about it."
2,"Feb 7, 2009","The cars are too often dirty and stinky.  Every single train should have one cop on it.  Too often people on these trains are sketchy as hell.  The trains are often very loud and make weird noises.  Why can't we learn from Japan.  BART has spread out more over the years, which is nice.  But prices are high and they don't run late enough.  If they could just run the trains until 3am then all the people coming from the bars could ride the trains.  The stations are usually dirty and many of them don't have bathrooms.  I think BART should be open 24 hours a day and the trains improved.  This time let's do it right,  And take a power washer and wash out those stations for chrissakes."

Let's not kid ourselves:- outdated interiors- intense rail noise (especially in the trans-bay tube)- sometimes malodorous cars and/or unknown liquids spilled on the seats- an assortment of drunk, homeless, or mentally ill riders.- people who shriek on cell phones or play what passes as ""music"" from cell phone speakers at max volume.But that said, there are good points too.- It's way cheaper than driving (especially over long distances), and this savings is even greater if you buy your tix with commuter checks.- Though it's subject to delays and problems, the longest I've ever been held up is 20 minutes. Average delay is about 5 minutes. People who drive along 880 during commute hours only wish they had such minimal delays.- If you're going to SFO (especially flying internationally), it's your best ground transportation option.For people commuting to SF from the East Bay (or vice versa), it's an excellent alternative to driving: less pollution, less wear & tear on your car, and far lower costs.And now to kick a hornets nest:Isn't it ironic that Marin County, with all its self-proclaimed progressive, environmentally-conscious liberal residents, refused to have BART expanded there? Nah, driving solo across the GG bridge in a Ford Excursion is a much better alternative. Gotta love ECINO people (Environmentally-Conscious In Name Only). Their mouths are truly where their wallets are."
3,"Feb 28, 2017","BART Worked Reasonably WellWe needed to go from point A to point B, than back again.  It was pretty easy, and we were able to get where we needed go in a timely fashion.  Fortunately, we are pretty experienced when it comes to using mass transit, so we are able to roll with most challenges presented by each system.For people who do not use mass transit often, BART can be a bit challenging.  Getting through the stations is pretty straightforward.  Determining which train is the correct one, however, is not.  Making matters worse is the fact that the trains are not marked on the inside to let you know which train and/or route you're actually using!Now, you may say, ""The announcers let you know all that information.""  I cannot argue for or against that point, despite having heard the announcers at regular intervals.  What I did hear - and I quote - was, ""fwjenlkjf Iwru bkjhsJIOETP FBAmoa njpeahm;l,"" and other announcements that were equally impossible to understand.Bottom Line-If you know your way around mass transit, you'll be fine.If you are new to the experience, don't be afraid to ask staff for help.  They are both helpful and friendly."

You stink, i don't know what sort of Midnight maintenence you do but it definately does not involve air freshners, and or febreze . Seriously I don't know how many people get on Bart and decide that peeing their pants is still the cool thing to do, but its more than apparent that it is still quite ""in""-Other notables, you are one of the more expensive rail systems i have been on, and for the price you are awarded with Standing room only in a cab of sardines... nothing better than being face to arm pit with the guy who just didn't get around to showering today... pleasant and worth every penny... let me tell ya. . . -You are deafening.. What?? huh?? I can see your lips moving but i can't hear you over the ear piercing scream of the tracks, when is that ever going to be fixed? You invoke everyone there to have to shout amongst themselves just to hold a conversation... yeah thats not annoying. - you have Bart cops who never seem to do anything.. i love the fact that the east bay trains dont run directly back to Sf so you are stuck on a richmond or pittsburg train with some of the more cracked out wanna be thugs in the bay... and what do they choose to do... walk up and down the bart trains back and forth, front to back, back to front, hooping, hollering, Singing, rapping, i dont know what the shit is but they are out of control... So the jist of it is, you are over priced, not accomidating, uncomforatable, loud, and unkempt by all levels of standards..you need a major face-lift my friend"

1,"Mar 31, 2007","[Update: I am currently living in Paris, France. I had to reduce my rating of BART to one star after my experience on the Paris Metro. (Yelp doesn't support the accent over the e, alas. ) Allow me to explain: In Paris a train comes to the station (one can be found within walking distance from anywhere) within 5 minutes, max (usually you will wait three minutes for the next train). It will cost you 1.5 Euros to get anywhere in Paris if you buy a ticket or you can buy a monthly pass for 53 Euros which gives you unlimited rides on the Metro and also gives you unlimited rides on the buses and the RER. Price goes down if you buy the yearly Navigo pass. People who work at the Metro stations are super nice and never have attitudes. (French) riders on the trains are nice, reserved and clean. The trains manage to go incredibly fast without ever creating a screeching noise so loud it almost makes your ears bleed. Also, people in France don't poop on the trains. And, even if they did, unlike on BART here is no rarely cleaned carpet to sop-up, collect and store all the blood, vomit, feces, urine etc. which constitute all those stains on the floor of the BART. I'm sure the carpet on BART was an attempt to find a material to absorb with painful screeching noise - a result of engineers with no knowledge of aerodynamic design.The metro system was built before 1920. The BART was built between 1964 and 1972 -- by then engineers had gotten us to the moon! and even with all the good examples of trains in the world BART planners still couldn't get it right!!!]  Original review: The Best Night Ever for BART was the night the new De Young Museum opened. There was also some bridge construction going on so the BART ran all night long. Even at 3:00 in the morning there were something like 10,000 people on the grounds of the De Young waiting to get in or just hanging out.Coming home to Berkeley at 4:30 in the morning the whole train was packed to the gills. There were hipsters and business people and drag queens and gang-looking kids and college students and distinguished looking seniors all crowded in together returning home from a night on the town. Suddenly the whole car broke out together in a rendition of some song -- I feel like it was Elton John or James Taylor -- something very 70s cheesy AM radio, and it was all so magical.The BART should run all night. I will never understand how this can be a ""World Class City"" when you cannot even stay out until 2am unless you have 40 bucks plus tip to get back across the bay in a hard-to-find taxi, or want to drive drunk. A friend of mine who is really into Railroad History recounted to me a story that the reason BART is such a money pit and cannot afford to (stay running at night, finish looping the bay, charge us compassionate fares, etc.)  is because when it was first designed (the business? the people? the government? I forget this essential fact!) wanted it to be designed so that it could never be annexed by (other?) businesses and used for hauling materials, so they designed the rails to non-standard size and designed cars that couldn't use standardized parts. So everytime something breaks down it has to be specially ordered and manufactured, unlike Caltrain. (sp?) -- If they had just used standardized train parts like NYC, etc. then they could afford to run and charge less. I am willing to believe this story is true until I am confronted with contrary evidence.UPDATE: Go read the Bay Area Rapid Transit page on the Wikipedia - there it outlines the whole story as to what I tried to say above.The Wiki also had this funny note:""Peter Hall, author of the book Great Planning Disasters, describes BART as one of the sensational planning disasters of the 20th century, alongside the Anglo-French Concorde and the Sydney Opera House."" -- ha!On a final downer note, TWO times I have seen coiled piles of actual human poop on the carpet of the BART. I don't know what they clean that carpet with but I hope it is CDC approved.It makes me want to have one of those CDC/Hot Zone/Nasa/Silkwood decontamination showers installed at the door to my house."
4,"Sep 2, 2007","I'm a big fan of public transportation and love the idea of BART a lot.  I ride BART everyday to and from work, and generally have few beefs about the service. However, while I'm at it...On my ride in, I pay my 25 cents and pick up a San Francisco Chronicle and keep tabs on the basic happenings in the news.Going home, and after a long day all I really want to do is relax (and occasionally write me a few Yelp reviews).  Thing is, there's this one driver whose SFO/Millbrae train I seem to get on about 2 times in 5, and he's a total GROUCH who screams into the public address at passengers about standing in the doorway.  If you've been on his train, you know what I'm talking about, and I must say it's a pretty awful way to end your day hearing him go ballistic on us paying passengers.  Someone needs to talk to this guy so that he can chill a little.OK, enough of a rant.  I'm actually typing this as he yells at me, so that's what's in my head as I type.  So, minus 1 star for the grouchy driver, but otherwise, go BART."

4,"Aug 18, 2006","I walk through the turnstyles into the Macarthur station, and there's this dude with a flaming pink shirt trying to leave the station. He puts his ticket through a bunch of times and the computer won't let him out.  So he starts talking with the attendant about the problem.  The argument was starting to get pretty heated, but thereafter I went upstairs to wait for my train.  Found out it 'twas about 19 minutes away, and I thought that argument would get quite interesting.  I headed back downstairs to observe. The guy is yelling back and forth at the BART lady about how it's bad Karma that she won't let him out of the station.  He still owed some cash on his ticket.  He's yelling at her saying that he's gotta pick up his wife who has a flat tire (he was obviously flambouyantly gay). She finally tells him that she's calling bart police and eventually a bunch of F and C words start driveling out his mouth.  Then he walks away in a huff with his hands on his hips and says ""...annnnnd you have BAD teeth!!!"". He goes to sit down and wait for I dunno what.  Eventually this 300lb thug lookin black dude is like ""hey man, you need a couple bucks, I can spot you"". Flambouyant guy comes over and is sayin ""Oh thank you thhhooooo much give me your card, and I'll mail you a check as soon as I get home"". Thug guy reaches for his wallet, and instead of pullin out a few singles, he smashes the guy in the face with his fist as hard as I've ever seen anyone get hit.  He's like ""yea, that's what chu get for flippin out in my BART station!""  Thug jumps over the turnstyles and hops out of the station. I'm already almost pissin my pants at this point because I'm such a pussy, cowering in the corner and calling 911.  I mean Flambouyant was annoying as hell and quite obviously in the wrong, but I thought he was gonna need to pick up some of his teeth off the ground after that hit. Have you ever called 911?  I got some nice elevator music and the ol ""thank you for your call, you are a valued customer, please wait 25 minutes while we sit here whackin off"".  About 26 minutes later I finally get an operator.  I tell her I just witnessed an assault at the BART station, and there was a guy there that was in serious need of help. Hang on while I dial bart police. More elevator music... At this point, I grab the next train, and the operator finally picks up just before I hit the tunnel into Oakland.  I'm tell her ""look, the emergency is prolly over, but it would be nice if they sent a cop over to Macarthur. Next BART story... I got some news from home and I was overcome with emotion. So I'm really on edge (usually my strongest emotion is hunger -- WHEN i'm not menstruating).  I hop on BART after a 12 hr day and head home.  This skinny urkel lookin guy hops on my train, and starts playing the bongos on the car door with his two pepsi bottles.  I put up with it for a few minutes, then he starts bangin through the aisles with the bottles.  I first glance at him with a ""fuck you"" face, then ask him ""HEY ARE YOU GONNA SHUT THE FUCK UP ANY TIME SOON?????"" He's stops dead in his tracks and says ""WHAT R YOU GONNA DO ABOUT IT"" and waves his hands at himself as if to tempt me to beat his ass. Walk up to him look him square in the eye, nose to nose, and I say ""NOTHING, JUST SIT THE FUCK DOWN AND STOP BOTHERING ALL THESE PEOPLE"".Then I cowered into the other train. GO BART, YOU ROCK!"
1,"Jul 11, 2006","BART, you have single handedly ruined my day.  As if it wasn't bad enough that you won't extend out to Pinole and I have to drive to El Cerrito and spend 10 minutes looking for parking so that I just barely miss the train to San Francisco, and then I have to wait another 15 minutes for the next train, THEN to add insult to injury, a train gets stuck in the Transbay Tunnel putting my train at a dead stop.  And what happens when it's 7:30am in the morning and you're sitting in a stationary train?  That's right, YOU FALL ASLEEP!  And then what happens?  YOU MISS YOUR STOP!!!!  Then, to add salt into your open wounds, the trains are backed up from the initial train stuck in the Transbay Tunnel and it takes another 20 minutes to go back to where you should have gotten off the train in the first place.  Gas rating: 5When I said everything gives me gas, that includes stress, and this event was super-unbelievably stressful to me.  All in all, it took me 2 hours to go 25 miles.

The thought of those filthy, festering, swine-flu-infested seats is enough to drive any well-adjusted person into the first stages of OCD. Yes, that's me standing by the stainless steel pole on an almost empty train, germaphobia levels at orange alert. On the other hand, BART is generally reliable (on-time), easily accessible, and allows me to trek into the City without having to deal with traffic congestion, the toll, dumb asses who drive in the FastTrak lane who don't have FastTrak and hold everyone who does have FastTrak up while they merge into Cash Only lanes, and of course - exorbitant city parking fees. Plus, from the Rockridge station I actually get into downtown SF quicker than most people who live in SF themselves. So with all of that into consideration, add one billion and four stars."

On the other hand, I've noticed more train cars are having vinyl seating instead of cloth so maybe they are working on that?ASIDE from all that, I have been on many different trains around the country and world.  In comparison, BART is by far the most comprehensive.  There is only one platform so all you have to do is figure out the correct side to go on.  They are very organized for events of all kinds and have longer trains available at these times.  The waiting time is so minimal that if you miss a train, you aren't screwed because of the frequency of trains (unless of course you are transferring to another train or maybe late for work).All in all, this is a very efficient way to travel and I am very grateful to live in a place that has a train system like this available.  I don't even want to think about all the money and time I would have wasted in my life by driving instead."

But Bart needs to extend BART service to Livermore and Hercules. I thought the BART extension to Livermore would have already happen by now. Also I heard on the news some time ago that a Hercules a city council member or the mayor talked about wanting to extend BART service to Hercules. It never happened. BART needs to get it's future projects started because a lot of those future projects seem to be lies.

5,"Jan 15, 2008","Why on earth are you people reviewing BART? It's a public transport system. There is no alternative. Do you think if someone reads a bad review, they'll take the *other* subway system? Tips about avoiding panhandlers or weird station features would be useful, but most of these 'reviews' are just inane descriptions of reviewers personal feelings.If your review isn't useful to others, it's just clutter. Validating your own existence or deluding yourself into a false sense of importance are not good reasons to post something on Yelp. Those are reasons for using Twitter."

3,"Nov 1, 2007","I don't have much of a problem with BART, it gets me where I need to go about 87.66% of the time, and that's good enough for me.  If I find that I can't ""deal"" with BART (too crowded/too stinky/too tired) on a given day, I certainly have the option of walking, taking a cab, or stealing a car.  So yeah,  I deal with it.  It's actually my other fellow riders that greatly influence my experience....here are a few of my favorites:1) Gumby - He gets on the last train at the 16th Street and Mission station and immediately starts stretching and dangling his 6'4"" frame from the bars within the train.  This dude always wears his ""warm-up"" gear and a sweatband.  He props his legs up, cracks his vertebrae, etc. and really gets into it.  It's distracting and for some strange reason pisses me off because secretly I wish I could play on the BART jungle gym too and not give a shit, okay?2) Make Up Diva - Gets on BART looking like Sarah, Plain and Tall...gets off looking like Ru Paul. Honey, it's one thing to powder your nose or apply a little lip gloss, but if you've busted out with your vanity table and you're ""tap/swirl/buffing"" (a la Bare Escentuals), it's really fucking tacky. Get up 15 minutes earlier. Or do what I do and keep some makeup at work.3) Left Standers - the fuckers (yes, they ARE fuckers!) who stand on the left side of the escalator when I'm pistoning down trying to catch my coveted and usually-not-crowded 24th Street train.  It's during these times that I really wish pushing people out of the way wasn't illegal.  Yeah, you better believe they get the stink eye and an ancient Chinese curse.4) The Ballers - these are the men (and occasionally women) who stand *really close* to you while you are *sitting in an aisle seat*, so that their groin is generally in the vicinity of your ear/cheek.   It's almost as if they're trying to rest their balls/bits on my shoulder.  I'm generally not a fan of having my face 6 inches away from a stranger's external reproductive organs (at least, not without my consent), so I usually just offer them my seat :)This is a mere sampling of what BART has to offer...no...it's not that bad...it could be waaaaaay worse (like MUNI!).------------------------------------Update 12/29/2007:5)  BARF.

3,"Sep 16, 2011","You can tell a lot about a city by using their public transit system. In my travels I've noticed that the coolest, most livable and forward-thinking cities have excellent public transit, whereas in craptastic, redneck cities reliable public transportation is decidedly lacking.So where does that place San Francisco's BART system?Although overall I'd rate BART as being satisfactory, there are some aspects that make me want to sing its praises. First of all, I love how the fares are based on the total distance travelled. Unlike some cities that use a zone-based or a flat-fee system, BART allows passengers who are only going one or two stops to pay dirt-cheap fares. It just makes sense. Also, the vast area that BART covers allows commuters from far and wide to ditch their cars and get to their destination _fast_. It's the way of the future, people! Cars just AREN'T sustainable, so we may as well adjust now. But I digress...Why only three stars then? Well, firstly and most importantly, a BART station just doesn't seem like a place an average person would want to be once it gets dark. I'm normally a fairly self-sufficient and confident commuter, but when I was using BART in San Francisco I was convinced that someone would pull out a prison shank on me. The stations are just dark and sketchy. Also on the topic of stations, they didn't seem like they were being maintained properly. In a few cases the escalators weren't working, and I can't begin to tell you how infuriated I was struggling to haul a 75-pound bag up a long flight of stairs. I can't imagine how someone with physical disabilities would fare.Also, as someone who was a visitor in the city and not completely aware of exactly where I was based on sight, I found that the station names were inadequately marked. In most cities I've been in, subway/tube/u-bahn/skytrain station names are clearly marked and visible from the trains; stations are also loudly announced over the intercom systems so you know exactly how far you've travelled. On BART, I often struggled to find out if I was at my destination. In many stations, I saw no signs and although the operators would make announcements, the intercom was both a) muffled and b) drowned out by the screeching rails so I could barely make out a word. Fortunately for BART, this is a relatively quick and inexpensive fix.As a huge advocate of sustainable public transportation I applaud BART for giving Bay Area residents and visitors a reliable transportation system. Unfortunately, to continue to attract new riders and keep existing ones, there's a bit of work that needs to be done."

With BART I don't have to deal with traffic, tolls, accidents, $$$ for garages, or my most dreaded nemesis, parallel parking!  With BART, I pay and enjoy the ride. BART is my trusted friend: dependable, always around when I need them, usually on time, and willing to go anywhere with me.  I've taken BART for all sorts of reasons: whether it was going to the airport, checking out an A's game, going to a concert, meeting friends, for my many shopping trips to SF, and most importanly, when I don't feel like driving. Yes, BART can get expensive but it's SO convenient and you never have to worry about directions or getting lost.

To the city, back to the town, up to the 925, and down to Fremont; this system holds a place in my heart. I could recall all the times utilizing this for going to work in SF, to having random dates, to even the long journeys of transferring via Muni / AC Transit/ VTA  to BART to walking to ex-girlfriends' places etc.The schedule is decent, but needs to be extended because people who drink obsessively into the late hours of the morning. Know that they are prone to DUI exposure, therefore taking BART as an alternative wouldn't be that bad. Rush Hour is effective only between 8-10 am (Mon-Fri) if you have a job any later than that, then better be equipped with a book, magazine, or some kind of hand held device to keep you entertained. Sunday hours are off the wall and need to be adjusted, with the 30-45 min gaps of trains. They need to hurry up and pass the legislation to the expansion to San Jose, so I can avoid the ridiculous traffic on the infamous 880 and visit my friends in the South Bay with more convenience. Overall when I do return to the Bay Area, this is just one of the novelty things I'll always cherish despite all the bitching."

I am from souther California and I can not wait for the day LA hops on the public transit train (pun intended). BART, you get 5 stars because:-you run regularly-you get me where I need to be-I don't have to pay for airport parking or taxi's,-you are cheaper then muni when traveling in the city-I can visit my friends in the East Bay and not have to worry about driving -you took my girlfriends and I from Pleasent Hill to Milbrae to go to my brothers football game and allowed us to sleep/passout from drinking on the way back. **THE MOST IMPORTANT***-you gave me a way to keep my whoops with an ex boyfriend from driving me all the way home and having the uncomfortable conversation about why we were not going to get back together!

Why it only runs down to Fremont, not to San Jose? Why do they build a Dublin/Stoneridge station and not a new Livermore station instead? Why are they using cloth seats that absorb stains and odors and hard to clean and replace? Why are they still using this old stupid paper ticket system? Why they always ask for more tax-payers' money but nothing has been improved? Why why why? Comparing to other subway/transits in big cities like NY, DC, Europe, Japan and Hong Kong, BART is the worst! It is a shame to San Francisco and to Bay Area. How can one of the world's famous cities has such a bad and out-dated transit system. Whoever in charge of BART and those decision-makers should be fired or resigned. Look at what other cities offer to their citizens! We deserve a modern, smart, convenience, clean transit system, not BART!"

Now, if they could only stop using the short-car trains during some of the busiest commute hours..."
1,"Oct 7, 2008","We were trying to figure out how to get from Market to Castro.  We walked down to the station and we saw some ticket machines.  We bought two one-way tickets.  Then we realize we bought tickets for BART but needed to go in the MUNI.  Ok... so we thought it should be ok, right????The attendant at BART told us to go across the hall, literally, they are just a few feet from each other, and speak to the MUNI attendant.  She would not let us in because they are two different systems... what?  Yeap!  You got to pay in cash to use the MUNI but for BART you got to buy a ticket, totally not interchangeable and not refundable.  I found out that there are 3 different transportation systems (third one being CALTrain) within San Francisco and none of their systems speak to each other.... duh?????Why cannot make a system that you can just buy one pass and it works in all of them?  Why have all of these different systems operating within a city, with different personnel, with different forms of payment and it is all an aggravation to the general public?  Double duh...."
4,"Mar 12, 2010","The BART is cool with me. Mostly on time... mostly. Saves me cab fare and moves pretty zippy. Goes to not one, but TWO airports (sort of). Way faster than the Muni.Just between you and me, though, BART. You kinda smell. And chicks don't dig stained upholstery. Perhaps fabric seating and carpet was not the most practical decorating choice."
4,"Sep 29, 2009","I take the BART about 3 times a week and today as I was on the Richmond line heading to work I decided it's about time to give a Yelp review :)The only complaint I have with the BART is the price.  I think it's very pricey.  From Richmond to Glen Park station I pay $4.30 one way.  Now I'm an NYC girl where taking public transportation is like breathing for me.  Hmm...maybe I'll Yelp that too :)  And with all the crazy traffic on the Bay Bridge, hmm maybe I'll Yelp that too :)  I've started taking BART more often because it's comfortable, I get to relax and enjoy a book or people watch and I don't have to deal w/too much stress.  If the BART prices dropped I can honestly say this transit system would surely see an increase amount of people.I love BART!  I also not only wish the prices were a little more affordable but I also wish they'd extended it to other locations such as Vallejo, though I realize Vallejo isn't really considered the Bay Area :)"

The next afternoon, a four-on-one strong-arm robbery occurred at street level near a 12th Street BART entrance. Six juveniles knocked a Cal student to the ground in front of Berkeley's 2610 Channing Way on September 8, beat him, and stole his phone."
4,"Nov 14, 2007","I see that people here either hate or love BART.  The thing about BART is that, yes, IT IS OLD people.  It's been around since the 1970's and they just have yet to update it.  But I think if they really were to update it, it would cost a lot of money.  And I'm guessing they're just waiting till they really need to renovate it to do so.  Anyhow, the reason why BART is great:1) I can get to San Francisco from Fremont for cheaper than I would if I were to drive (With today's current gas prices + the crazy $4.00 bridge toll)2) I can sit on the BART train and relax instead of driving on the 880.Yeah, BART is kind of noisy and not the cleanest, but it is pretty good in my opinion considering how long it's been around.  I think we are lucky to even have an alternate option to driving and taking a bus (I HATE BUSSES)... And yeah, BART can be ghetto sometimes with the people that ride it, but then you see past that and all of the non-ghetto people, and business people that also ride BART.  Also, BART is great if you're going to the city for New Years Eve and want to drink and not worry about driving home, or going to the A's/Giant's stadium to watch a game and not worry about the ridiculous parking prices."

They give me $0.45 in change to make up for the difference AWESOMEAt least I didn't need to do any transfer and my seat was urine, potty, and vomit free."
4,"Mar 4, 2013","I'll throw in my modest two cents about my experience (singular) with BART. Easy, convenient, newbie-friendly.I did absolutely zero research regarding this rail system. Hopped off the plane, decided to give it a try, had about 20 minutes to catch the next train (via info collected from my smart phone), decided to go for it. (Cue Rocky theme song)I found the ticket machines confusing, and I didn't know how to otherwise find out how much to pay/where to get off the train, so I asked the woman working at the information booth. (Conversation with a stranger? Imagine!) She gave me the lowdown in about five seconds, and I was off. (Play Rocky theme song)Dragging my wheeled suitcase behind me, I quickly found a seat in front of a map of the stations, and within a few minutes I was loungin', maxin' and relaxin', reading a book. The train reminded me slightly of a system I took in Amsterdam a long while ago: quiet, comfortable, efficient. I'm sure this isn't always the case, and I saw a few suspect suspects, but I always felt safe. For about eight bucks, it was a perfect way to navigate the San Francisco streets and get a taste of the city. Love BART!"
2,"Feb 22, 2006","I'm sorry but every time I step past the ticket taking machine I hear that ""get down, get down"" music from Pulp Fiction in my head.  The feeling of 70s funk overtakes me and I expect to see Shaft and a bevy of girls with boas coming down the stairs. Why? Because the BART is still stuck in the 70s, the decor of the stations, the style of trains and its interior, the underground stations are labyrinth, dirty and dark looking.Hey, this is transportation, not a fashion show you say, so okay but the NYC subways get new cars, the DC metro looks like something out of the future yet we get this and somehow this gets rated the best transportation system in the nation.  What a sad statement on public rail in the U.S. is all that tells me.  The service is spotty, it doesn't run until later on the weekends which sucks if you've got a flight.  And flying out of Oakland, well, read my review of AIR BART for that.  If you don't plan for the absolute slowness of BART, AIR BART or both, you will find yourself like me, hailing a cab from the Coliseum station to the airport just to make your flight.  With its cheaper and shorter flights, OAK deserves a BART to the Airport but even that isn't enough to save the system."
4,"Aug 17, 2006","Reducing my carbon footprint will be neither convenient, nor cheap.I wish you would stay open later.  I wish you hadn't made the dubious decision to have upholstered seats.   I wish you weren't so expensive (even after employer discounts).  But you run.  And you usually get me most of the way there.  I hope you're not just a displacement of my pollution, but allow me to get around greener.  I'm not sure.  I trust that hum."
4,"Sep 13, 2007","BART's seats are comfier then Muni's and it is a lot faster.Umm honey, that's not chocolate on the seat."
4,"Jan 5, 2008","Ok I am totally erring on the side of the BART gods and giving this place a four instead of the 3.5 I'd like to give it. Really I depend on BART a lot (as I do VTA, CalTrain, Light Rail and the occasional jaunt on AC Transit and MUNI but hey who's saying utilizing public transportation is a bad thing). BART is an even contender heading with other Bay Area public transportation systems heading into this review and this is how I decided 3.5 was an adequate star rating:             efficiency: 4 out of 5--BART is usually on time (or within             a reasonable time frame). However, when there's a problem            at one station, there are problems with ALL trains heading in            that direction. unforeseen upside: if this was to happen to your            train under the transbay tunnel you could wind up on the news!            All joking aside, BART is well timed to commuter bus shuttles            and local bus services throughout/leading to 5 counties.             cleanliness: 2.5 out of 5, two things-don't ride the suspiciously             empty car on New Year's Day and hey, it beats MUNI.             comfort level of the trip: 3 out of 5--tip one during commute             hours, if you want to sit, always go for one of the first cars. For            every beautiful sunrise over SF in the wee hours you get five             people screaming on their cell phones, 2 homeless people             talking to you/themselves, 4 teenage girls squealing and one             guy sleeping for what feels like a dozen times over. Still it beats            MUNI.            convenience: 3.5 out of 5--during commute hours all is well. But             there is limited service between the lower East Bay and San             Francisco at night and on Sundays. As some have pointed out            they do close before the bars do, so that can kind of suck.             those creepy voices (the soft robot voice/robot boy voice) and            the flashing minute signs: 2 out of 5. Creepy. Plus when the             attendant or station agent blares across the loudspeaker you            can really detect the rhythm of the electronic voice afterwardsFrom when I use to have a car, I do remember that the parking lots I use to park in (Millbrae and Fremont) were both well lit and quite safe.I also feel like I get more than my fair share of late trains right in a row but that's a whole other story...."
5,"Nov 11, 2012","Love BART. Easy, few delays, nice routes, good schedules.  They are also pretty safe and have a lot of BART police on hand and for ride alongs.The only small complaint is they aren't the cleanest, but this is true f a,, public transit.  Technically there is no food or drink allowed onboard, and if people listened to this then I think it would be great, but people don't listen most of the time, causing messes.  Also, the annoyance of people feeling we need to listen to their cell hone conversations or loud music gets old, but that isn't BART, just rude people.Overall, a great public transit service."
3,"Nov 24, 2006","A great big ""eff you"" to BART for expanding to SFO. It created an unholy balance by forming 3 types of trains heading South of San San Francisco. The ubiquitous ""SF Daly City"", nearly extinct ""SF Colma"", and the hated ""SF SFO Millbrae"" now dominate the south of Balboa Park landscape.Do we needed a train to SFO? It's an ok idea, but in my opinion the shuttle thing worked fine. We certainly did not need that hundred million dollar glass and concrete farce we call the SFO station. How many people use the South City and San Bruno stations anyway? You can count them in the tens.And to further drive home a point why even penetrate San Mateo county or take BART to San Jose? Those snobs are not enlightened enough to take public transportation Those prissy princesses are too busy driving around in S.U.V's or taking their beloved Caltrain (like omg! yay caltrain! let's go drink appletinis and shop for Coach bags) too appreciate BART. Effete noveau rich bourgosie bastids! They don't belong in our shining city on a hill!Sorry for turning it into a class war, but I must admit I do get a personal joy when I see a Caltrain rider's face writhe in horror when they enter the BART train. (HA! Go back to Atherton!)The point is: Don't shove BART into places it wasn't mean't to go. Screw the South Bay. They stole the A's and they're a bunch of Prissies anyway. Bart should expand North and east reaching out to the hardworking, taxpaying coutnies of Alameda and Contra Costa. The Richmond line should extend north and connect to Rodeo and Hercules  with a possible link to Vallejo. TONS of people commute from Vallejo and would clear up the northern corridors.That hate tirade aside, I do appreciate the SF Richmond line (or as I like to call it ""the Blue Ball Express""). Thank you for saving me the costs of living in Berkeley  to school by allowing me to commute form home.SHut down SSF, San Bruno, and Millbrae trains now! Long live the Colma line!""Es ist alles lcherlich, wenn man an den Tod denkt"" - Thomas Bernhard."
3,"Feb 3, 2011","I take the Bart from Downtown Berkeley or Rockridge to Daly City and back 3x a week for work, with an occasional 1 or 2 extra trips to Powell for shopping.Pros:Gets you to most of the major cities in the Bay Area, at a speed competitive with driving (especially since driving = sitting in traffic most of the time here), without requiring any worries about tolls or parking.Efficient. The Bart is more reliable than a bus because it will actually show up at the time it's supposed to.Clipper card + 6.35% HVD autoload!Train conductors stick half their body out their window to make sure those automatic doors aren't closing before everyone's in.Cons:Lots of sketchy people on the BART and it sucks to have to sit near them.Questionable cleanliness of the cloth seats and carpeted floor.Expensive, though if traveling to SF, not as expensive as paying the $6 Bay Bridge Toll and THEN trying to find and pay for parking.Sometimes the BART is laggy or makes random stops to let other trains pull ahead/get back on schedule/maintenance.Most BART stations have broken escalators, so expect a lot of running up and down stairs.Crazy crowded anytime people want to go to work / leave work from Powell, Montgomery, and Embarcadero.Once, I saw a drug deal happen right in front of me.80% of the female BART window workers are always angry.Supposedly, a $250 fine for eating/drinking on the BART.Closes at midnight so you can't stay out too late (a la Cinderella).Sometimes some lines just don't run and you have to take another one and transfer."
2,"Apr 22, 2008","Oh, I hate BART.  BART's like that ""friend"" that has a crush on you but you hate and only hang out with because they're the one person you know with a car.  Except for BART doesn't like you that much, because it charges you lots of money (like $1.50 to go 8 blocks!), doesn't take you very close to where you want to go, has an old car that stinks, and also picks up all kinds of crack addicts on the way. But it's the easiest, cheapest, and most guilt-free way to get to the airport. Same can probably be said about the east bay."
3,"Feb 24, 2011","Well BART where to begin?  Hm... Oh, first, people it's just BART not The BART.  Adding ""the"" makes you seem like a tourist.  *Done being a jerk*Okay so I took BART nearly every single day of my college life.  That means from August of 2006 to December of 2010 I was on the Fremont/Daly City train.  This being said I've got plenty of experiences that create a reason for this review to be middle of the road 3 stars.Most days I didn't have a problem.  I got on in the morning, was at school on time, and then on the way home I got back fine.  Also most days I was on a packed train to and from because I was often on with the commuters so I've never had much of a negative experience regarding BART patrons during those peak times.  However, you bike riders- bikes aren't allowed during peak commute hours so if you're docking stars for people not giving you any room, you may want to think about when you're getting on the train.Though I can't say my time riding BART was without problems.  This is where the system seems to completely fall apart.  If there is a single issue- not matter what size it is- the system comes to a screeching halt.  I guess that's what happens when you've got one track for every line going into the city/east bay cities.  Switch problem?  You're stuck.  Equipment problem?  You're stuck.  In the tunnel from Lake Merritt to West Oakland on any given day?  You're stuck.My biggest issue I've ever had was when there was a fire in the Hayward yard and I was stuck in 100% packed trains from start to end everyday for over a week.  The trains were literally completely full at the first station and cleared out only a few stops before mine which made for some terrible mornings.My other issue was having to get up mega early to get to school on time since it takes at minimum 45 to get from Fremont to Daly City and the Fremont station has very limited parking (I'll do a review for this station later).  Granted this was fine for me because without having to drive I could do homework, sleep, play video games, listen to music, read, and so on.But what of the people.  As I said the commuters are just fine.  Though when I started school late or finished early I was often on trains with rowdy kids, the most ghetto people you can find, and the pan handlers.  I've even had to ride it later at night (7, 8 pm or so) for when I had late classes.  However, Contrary to what you'd think the late trains are actually quite safe.  Most of the people on the train are the people who stay late at the office, people who are exhausted, and people coming/going out.  Though the stations at night are a different story.  While nothing ever happened to me in the stations or on the train, having to get off and transfer at an Oakland station wasn't the best feeling.  So overall it depends on what time you're on the train.  Same goes for station agents.  Some are totally helpful and amazing, some treat you like utter crap.My other problem is that they stop direct service to some places from the city in the evening.  This meant having to transfer trains at 7:30 most nights I had late class so I could get home.  It's not like no one's going that way, but they still end direct service pretty early.The trains themselves are decent.  They are phasing out the carpet in favor of textured floors to increase traction for when it's rainy and so they can be cleaned easier.  The cushioned seats are getting pretty ratty in most trains, but it beats sitting on plastic for an hour.  My biggest complaint is the temperature control in the cars.  Each car has a mind of it's own so some cars will be blazingly hot while others will be freezing- all on the same train.  There are even times where it'll be 80 outside and the heat is on in the car or it's freezing and rainy, but the AC is on.  I just don't get it...Lastly, price.  It is not cheap.  From Fremont/Union City to Daly City is pretty much 12 bucks roundtrip.  There really aren't any discounts for students so I was stuck getting the $48 ticket for $45 at Safeway... woo... I saved 3 bucks... They do offer free transfers for Muni at the Daly City station, but you're better off using SFSU's shuttle.  It is cheaper than gas + bridge + parking + parking tickets, but it's still steep.  Yes they need the money, but you'd think they could do something for students.So that is my mega long review for BART.  It's a necessity for some of us, but it is pricey and you do not want to be stuck when there are problems."
1,"Oct 6, 2010","I think BART is awful. It stinks, the trains are filthy, it's loud, stressful, crowded and people don't care about others throughout their commute. They step on feet, push others around, step on my dog's feet, usually don't even get up for elderly customers or disabled guests. I think this my most negative review I have written so far..But well.."
1,"Nov 3, 2005","We will be having a really, really big earthquake here. Whenever, it's just inevitable. So, if you are in the transbay tube, you will most likely die. The tube will disconnect from the bay floor and break away from it's moorings on one end of the bay or the other ... or break into smaller bits.If you are on the raised tracks, they are predicted to topple over and drop train cars some 30 feet to the ground.Also, the stations are expected to flood all the way to 24th Street Station. Not all of a sudden or in a matter of minutes, but ... they will.How do I know this? Bart's own safety analysis!Bart? No thanks.UPDATE: Now that they are fixing all the overhead lines and so on ...is it still so funny, eh? Heh?!Also... too damn expensive. Bad hours. I want a system like the Metro in Paris. Damn..."
5,"Sep 3, 2006","I Give The BART 5 Stars for being really convenient when you fly Into SFO!!  So Instead of using an Airport taxi with crazy fees or Renting a Car to face crazy traffic and tolls. I Choose The BART! Living in the Seattle area and having only a Monorail to and from the Space Needle. The Bus System is great and all but, I wish the SEA area had something like this.This is my favorite form of Transportation Gateway tool to The City."
4,"Apr 27, 2009","It may be ghetto but it works and it's cheap. It's easy to use too. I'm from So Cali where our public tranportation sucks or seems like it is rarely in existence.I was originally supposed to land at SFO but the plane needed to make a landing at Oakland airport because it has a longer landing strip there. Technical difficulties, bleh! Anyways, I had to get into SF city and didn't want to pay a billion dollars by taking a cab. I proceeded to hop on the BART at the coliseum location. GHETTO FAB! and use caution please. Be aware of your surroundings and valuables. Friggin' Oakland!Anyway, it was a 30-45 minute ride or so but it got me to where I needed to go for under $6 so I was happy I made it there in one piece. The BART is pretty cool. Even though in LA we have the metro subway, it just doesn't seem as efficient as the bay's BART.BTW, I don't blame the BART for that one incident where the officer shot the suspect. That was all on the person and not the transportation system. This review has nothing to do with that ordeal."
3,"Jul 11, 2007","Okay, this is just an excuse to share a funny anecdote. My real feelings about BART are that as much as I like the idea, it's next to useless because there are not enough lines to call it Rapid Transit. One line through SF? Get real!My friend is enroute  to work at 6 AM. Behind him, some guy is checking out all of the potential ringtone options on his cell phone -- much to the annoyance of everyone around him. A distinguished-looking elderly gentleman sitting next to my friend, who has been quietly reading his paper, suddenly turns to him, and in a voice loud enough to be heard  by everyone close by, says: ""Interesting article in the paper today. It's about a short story contest.""My friend says cautiously, ""Is that right?""The man then says, ""Yes, they had to pick from hundreds of entries. What's really fascinating is the subject of the story that won.""""And what was that?""""It was a about some guy who kept  fucking with his ringtones on BART at 6 AM until someone murdered him.""My friend said the rest of the ride to work was blissfully quiet."
1,"Mar 8, 2017","For some reason the wizened council of BART elders has decided that the city of Pittsburg (pop. ~66k) should have a BART station while San Jose (pop. ~998k) does not.  They claim to have a plan to build a station in downtown San Jose but their timeline has taken longer than the moon landing project and the god damn trans-continental railroad (literally; it's taking longer than to build a train track across several states with picks and shovels than tens of miles with modern earth moving equipment).  Also, for some reason cars and airplanes can drive themselves but trains can't."
3,"Jul 24, 2006","Do you ever wonder why the signs are so dark on BART?  you can not even read them, no matter how routine you may be, you still can not read the signs and the fear of missing the stop sets in, not only can you not see the signs the walls are so dark, you can not read anything, bart is very interesting, the seats look like they came out of airplanes and the back cars on hot daze and like fog banks...no wonder why so many police patrol bart, you just cant see...Does someone want to camaign for a brighter bart:)Neon flourescent lights would be PERFECT:)"
1,"Aug 22, 2007","When I moved here I thought this was a *REAL* public trans system, like in Chicago, NYC, Tokyo. But it sucks. Clean yes, but it doesn't run overnight. And the trains aren't very frequent. Commuting to SF State really blows. I take rideshare or MUNI when possible.Or Flexcar."
1,"Jun 27, 2011","It never EVER fails: 1. Disgustingly dirty seats. Like, ew. For reals. 2. Random people who appear homeless (this, I have no issue with) who insist on sauntering from section to section singing, panhandling, yelling at imaginary foes... So irritating.  And somehow, the seat next to me must always look extra comfy. Cuz he/she always ends up there. 3. Fights. It seems like every 3rd time I ride BART I witness a trash-tastic encounter of one sort of another, which almost NEVER ends with law enforcement showing up. How come I see a million BART Police cars on the roads, but NONE actually AT BART?! Again - Irritating. I would rather drive circles for an hour looking for parking in SF than ride BART."
2,"Oct 10, 2010","South Florida public transportation makes the BART look like the pinnacle of public transportation, but this rating is not based on comparing public transportation systems, otherwise, NYC would take the cake.The good thing about the BART is it is usually on time and when it is not on time BART is good at informing its riders of the delays.The bad stuff about BART....hmmm.... where to begin, where to begin. The BART needs renovation to weather an earthquake because we all know if the major when hits the BART is hopeless. Renovation is also needed to add comfort for riders. How about accommodating the bike riders with a bike rack on the BART? Better seating? More poles to hold onto? Another negative about BART is it is expensive, very expensive. Their deals for college kids stink and they should consider students, who are broke. Why can't they make a deal like MUNI?Third, the BART seems to me it always breaks down. If I had a nickel for every time I was late due to a malfunction I would be rich enough to drive into the city. Hmmmm (thinking)....not really, but you can catch my drift.Lastly, How about the BART operate longer hours, so people from East Bay have a more affordable way to get home from going out in the city.The BART works, but definitely could work more efficiently."

5,"Nov 23, 2010","I love BART. It's fast. It's easy. It's moderately priced. When the train enters tunnells, the tinted windows allow you check out cute passengers and then you can catch yourself being caught checking them out. Then there's that quick darting of the eyes. You're fooling no one. lolWhat prompted me to finally write a review was the last time I was on BART. It was just before the World Series. The Giants were playing the Phillies. It was the night that the Giants went to the World Series. I'm getting choked up just thinking about that night. Anyway, BART was packed and there was that one passenger who tries to keep the doors open and holds everyone up. Well, a conductor called that passenger out and told him ""don't be selfish. There are other people on the train that need to get somewhere.""When we started to push towards the door to exit, a couple of the other passengers as well as myself said to our friends ""don't be selfish,"" and shared a laugh.

I was more stressed from the cab ride than I was from dealing with the TSA and the flight. BART eliminates the drama. Get on, get there, get on with your life. Outside of SFO and downtown SF the station locations kinda suck, the TVM's can be a pain to use, but overall it's not bad. That being said I feel the Chicago Transit Authority's EL system, even though it's much older kicks BART's derriere in so many aspects. 3 stars. It beats going into near cardiac arrest from the cab drivers from hell."
4,"Nov 9, 2007","Aaaahhh BART.  somedays i work in the east bay, some which i take BART, some which i drive. and let me tell you (perhaps you already know) bay bridge traffic blows. not to mention the glorious nimits 880 freeway. north or south, whatever time of day, it sucks pretty bad too. i always regret it (driving that is) when i could be spacing out, reading a book (cause does anyone have any OTHER time to READ these days?), people watching, etc. instead...stuck in a wasteland of cars while BART is whizzing by.no public transit system is perfect (hence the 4 stars). yes, some of the cars are smelly. the fabric cushy seats sure SEEM comfy....but actually when you think about how many people have sat on them (and done who-knows-what on them) you might opt to stand. but all in all, the trains are usually on time and go to lots of places (most of which i personally never need to be but that is besides the point). i don't know why they can't run late trains for those who live in the east bay and wanna party in the city. or for the ""off-chance"" you find yourself partying in the east bay and live in the city...whoops, did i say that out loud?"
4,"Jan 7, 2006","Having used public transit in the other major subway areas: Paris Metro, London Underground, New York, Boston T, and DC, I have to say BART does a good job. Compared to most of the other systems, BART is efficient, relatively quiet, and (perhaps unique to BART) carpeted, which does cut down on the noise in the cars. On the downside, the station staff vary greatly in motivation and attitude. Downtown Berkeley staff are helpful, Powell St morning staff are, at best, retarded. I'm a cyclist, which means that when I exit, I have to run my ticket through, exit without the bike, re-enter through the gate, and then exit with my bike through the gate (the standard routine if you have a bike). On two occasions, the guy who works at Powell St has chased after me for failure to pay (yes, I did pay, thank you very much). Really, I love being treated like a criminal. A real upside to the BART system, despite the Powell St experience, is free valet bike parking in Downtown Berkeley. Luxury! They have a bikestation that holds 150 bikes near the ticketing area. You give them your bike and get a ticket. At the end of the day, you retrieve the bike from them. That's it. It means I can bike commute and not worry about having to take my train on board (bikes are banned at peak hours). The system is safe and fairly well patrolled -- I've never had a problem in the seven years I've commuted on it. Returning from the city at midnight is no big deal either. I do wish BART ran until 2am. The last train to the East Bay is around 12:30, which means if you want to go to the city to see a late show, you'll need to drive. Would I rather drive than commute on BART? Heck no. BART is a great service. It's not as quiet as the DC system, and the maps aren't as cool as the London Underground, but it's miles better than the Boston T and I'm grateful that it's here."
5,"Jul 3, 2007","Three stars for BART?  Obviously NONE of these people take MUNI who provide a low rating.  It will do no good to give extensive justification for my rating other than to say: it runs on time - all the time - with very few exceptions.  MUNI is exactly the opposite.  'Nuf said!Oh yes, one thing: I lived in San Francisco for over 25 years, until about three years ago.  If I lived in the extremities of the BART line, I would probably complain about the fact that BART does not have and cannot easily accommodate express trains - at least currently.  There don't seem to be many complaints about that though."
3,"Jan 1, 2008","Compared to MUNI, BART is 100% awesome. Otherwise, not so much.I don't understand why BART continues to raise their fare prices, yet they don't really do anything with that extra money other than pay their drivers the highest salary of any transit agency. Sure, whenever I've needed to take BART to work or to an appointment the train arrived on-time and everything was fine, but what about running until, oh I don't know, 2 AM? How about cleaning your train seats more often? How about making BART stations in the East Bay a little more safe? How about not making me rearrange my schedule to get home from work/school because I can't bring my bicycle on your stupid trains during rush hour?As a transit system that can get me from point A to point B, it's not bad. Unless someone kills themselves by throwing themselves onto the tracks or the train catches fire (both of which have happened to me while on BART), you are on-time. I appreciate that. Now how about using the extra money you jack from me and use it to run later, allow me to use bring my bike during rush hour, or not have to step over the homeless just to get to school. I'd appreciate all of them, but at this point I will gladly take one."
3,"Aug 12, 2010","For an American urban region, BART is a good and efficient service to get around. Thank GOD they built this so long ago, can you imagine the bay area without it?It's not the nicest transportation system in terms of aesthetics, in that the seats are disgusting and dirty and the trains screech extremely loudly when traveling, but it gets you places so phuck it."
4,"Mar 25, 2011","BART to me stands for BAD ASS RAPID TRANSIT.  I think Bart is amazing, i grew up in Sacramento and they apparently don't believe in public transportation let alone a somewhat high speed train.  I don't know what i would do with out BART. How else can you get from West Oakland to the city in less than 7 minutes for $3.10?  How would i get home from Rockridge after a big night of drinking?  BART is extremely efficient and damn cheap.  The trains are absolutely disgusting when it comes the cleanliness. They definitely need to replace all of the seats with plastic ones, that way they can wipe them down and sanitize them occasionally.  I believe this is in BART's plans and should be completed by 2013.To all the people bitching about BART, shove it.  BART could not even exist and then think about how much you would be complaining."
5,"Mar 18, 2012","5 Stars * * * * *I know a lot of negative things can be said about BART but there is also one simple awesome fact and on that fact alone am I rating BART 5 Stars.Awesome transportation system that can zip me close to where I want to go if I so choose to use the system. I would way rather ride the BART then the CalTrans any day!I'm also looking forward to BART extending down in to the South Bay area of San Jose. Once that happens we truly will have a BART system that covers the entire San Francisco/San Jose/Oakland Bay Area.I think far too many people dog a system because of things people do or don't do, but as a whole the BART transportation system is awesome. I've ridden BART from many of the stations from Fremont to Oakland to San Francisco and I've loved it. I've also caught the BART from Milbrae & Daly City. BART is way cheaper then parking and easier on my car and easier on the pocket book."
4,"Feb 28, 2009",Whooooooooosh and I'm at the office.While upholstered seats are way more comfy than hard plastic they are super dirty.  I don't know how people rest their heads back and take naps on that stuff.
1,"Aug 8, 2009","What public transit system shuts down 2 hours before the bars do and right when most concerts let out? BART.What idiots said ""Let's use carpet and plush seating for thousands of people to use everyday so that it can constantly reek of BO, piss and shit!""BART.BART is so inconvenient that I would rather sit in rush hour traffic for an hour and a half and search for parking for 30 minutes than have to rely on it to get me anywhere."
3,"Oct 10, 2012","At the moment BART trains are decked out with stickers boasting 40 Years of Service. It shows. Really, though - this transportation system is showing its age. I wouldn't use BART if there was another option. There isn't another option and they know it so, hey, why should they try harder? As it stands it sure as hell beats driving into the city. Being able to get on and (usually) get a seat, kick back and just zone out for 45 minutes is usually worth the occasional hiccup. Thankfully, BART has finally started to replace some of those old, filthy cloth seats with new, vastly superior vinyl ones. Having seats people aren't afraid to sit on is a great big step in the right direction. The fact that they are only now just starting this process shows what a stranglehold BART has on the Bay Area transit system, though. Let's remove all that disgusting stained carpet while we're at it. How was this not done decades ago? It makes it easier on the BART cleaning crews as much as anything. BART certainly isn't perfect - especially on weekends whenever they're doing maintenance. The delays can really chew into your day. Trains are mostly on time, but there's always problems here and there. I haven't used a public transportation system that doesn't encounter these problems though. When you're dealing with machines things are bound to go wrong. And in the case of rush hour service, frankly I'm amazed it runs as smooth as it does. While it is getting better if you were to reduce a BART train to its essence it is basically a rolling can of germs. But most of the time it is worth riding with the germs so you don't have to pay for parking, or worry about traffic, or how many drinks you have at the game. Hey, it's public transport - if you're expecting perfection you're bound to be disappointed."
1,"Nov 14, 2016",I am a heavy commuter from the east bay and I always experience a major delay which I really find annoying. It's fine to have some delays here and there but it's been ridiculously too many! I don't think these clowns value passengers time at all.
3,"Aug 12, 2006","It's no NYC subway but it get's you to certain places in the Bay Area well enough. I'm all for public transit but when you have to take three different systems to get from San Jose to San Francisco (and get around the cities), it's frustrating enough to make me drive. They should have built this sucker out extensively when they had the chance. Now if it ever happens it's gonna cost a lot of money and cause a lot of disruptions. Sigh."
5,"Mar 16, 2012","What a wonderful train station. I go up to San Francisco periodically and find that staying in San Bruno or Milbrae, and taking the train up, makes for a very easy trip, and no car problems in down town. This train station is large, open air, easy in and out and we love it every time. Clean, nice helpful people, (as I always have a question or two) Take the train and leave the car behind!"
3,"Oct 30, 2006","BART is ridiculously expensive, with no weekly or monthly passes like most other major transit systems.  The trains don't come as frequently as they should, and don't run late enough.  The seats are reasonably comfortable, but not very sensibly organized for commute time, with people awkwardly sandwiched between seats instead of standing and holding the railing along the edges.  And passengers can be really annoying -- for example, they will line up and scowl at anyone who cuts in from the side of the line, even when the train is 90% empty. On the plus side, you help out the environment a little by not driving, and it does span a pretty wide range of the Bay Area.  Within SF, there is a decent MUNI/bus system to get around, even to places BART won't take you.  And it's convenient to take to the OAK or SFO airports."
3,"May 7, 2007","Honestly I appreciate BART.  It makes commuting from Millbrae and Oakland into the city a whole lot easier for me in the morning.  But there are some things that just IRK the living hell out of me.- the seats.  if you've been on other public transit you will know that it is NOT normal for seats to have brown stains and smell like pee.  to this, i suggest converting the seats from cloth covered to plastic seats. yeah it'll be somewhat more uncomfortable but at least it'll be cleaner.- the arrangement of the seats.  as is right now, its really inefficient and can only seat a limited number of people.  japanese JR has seats that go in rows, so it fits more people into the train and more ppl can actually sit.  - not letting strange smelling people in the bart. this def needs to be worked on bc whenever there's someone smelling funny sitting in the train everyone else avoids that area for a good 15 feet. more space is lost.the prices, i suppose, are somewhat reasonable.  the transit system in DC, i think, is a LOT better, though. other than that, good timing, and i wish it ran later."
3,"Jan 7, 2013","The Setting:  Daily use of BART system while on project out here.  I am not here on weekends so this review is for weekdays only!On the right panel of this screen I see 6 reviews for BART and all of them are either 5 stars or 1 star....I will take a shot in the dark guess and say that the 1-star reviews likely come from non-frequent riders who have very different expectations for a public transportation system.  That being said....The Cost:  4 starsIf you compare the cost to that of cabs or driving and parking, the BART is insanely cheap.  I pay $7 roundtrip to get from Montgomery to 19th st Oakland.  The parking alone would cost me more.  It is $8 from Oakland to SFO, versus over $50 in a cab.The Time:  5 Stars (for daily commute), 3 stars (for Airport)It is MUCH quicker from SF to Oakland via BART.  It is slower than driving/cabbing from SF to Pleasanton.  It is much slower (around an hour versus 30 minutes) versus cabbing/driving to SFO.  That being said, I'd rather avoid the rental car process in this city for many reasons...NOTE: If you are traveling to a specific destination that is only accessible via one of the lines (Richmond vs Freemont vs Dublin vs Bay Points), I would encourage going to the BART website and looking at their schedule.  It is super accurate and punctual, and it's a cruddy feeling to get down there to see your train leaving and having to wait 15 minutes (or more) for the next one.The Crowd:  4 stars (during business rush hour), 1 Star (any other time)During the business rush hours if 730-9am and 5-630pm, the BART crowd is almost primarily working people, almost all keeping to themselves and wearing headphones.  Bike riders that use the BART are fairly respectful and not pushy with their equipment.  As expected, SF's substantial vagrant population takes over the BART system after-hours, using it to sleep.  They constantly pester you even if you are wearing headphones, which after these months using it, I've now had to resort to being curt with them.  I normally wouldn't but they are fairly aggressive salespeople...The Bottom Line:  This is an effective, normally time-and-money-saving method of transportation in this city, but if you have the choice, I would use other means of transit during the later evening hours (after 7 pm)."
4,"Sep 1, 2009","I am feeling the love for the BART. It is fast, clean and from my time on it, not overly busy. This is very unlike the tube in London, which is slow and crowded. I would be happy to use this form of transit on a regular basis.Go the BART!"
5,"Aug 2, 2011","Oh BART, how I love ye, let me count the ways...1. Paying for distance as opposed to flat fare is pretty genius, verging on ""DUH"", when you consider how far you're getting for the price.2. They come often, and are pretty reliable about it. Other transit systems should take a page from their notification book (Sac lightrail finally is, oh so slowly). AND they run til reasonably late hours (which is rare these days--at least coming from the town I do).3. Stations are nice, trains are clean (relatively speaking--especially considering they're carpeted and haven't changed much since the '80's).4. Most stations are connected to other transit lines, not something a lot of systems do enough of.Need I say more?"
5,"Jan 1, 2017","I am one of the thousand commuters who ride the trains, which are often delayed, broken and worn down. But instead of complaining, I want to offer my compliments to the everyday front-line workers there, not the ones who occupy the office suites. Whenever I go to  BART stations for assistance, the problem gets solved professionally and courteously. Whenever there is trouble on the trains with disruptive behavior from passengers, I use the BART watch app and the response is immediate. Officers are concerned and take their duties seriously. I once lost an iPad on a train and reported it.  Within a week, it was found and returned to me via the BART lost and found, and the reps there were exceptional.  Day to day, we lose sight of how old the infrastructure and equipment is, and how the people there make it successful and try their best. I appreciate what you do. Thank you."
2,"Dec 22, 2007","BART...The GOOD, the BAD, the UGLY.Some days, I'm glad she's around.  And other days, I wish could just dump her!The GOOD- More convenient than trying to drive across the bridge everyday.- Faster than MUNI from the Mission to Downtown SF; 5 min vs. 45 min.- Reminds me of the monorail in Disneyland.  Whee!!!!The BAD- Stops running after 12pm on the weekends.- Dirty seats and floors.  I really don't want to know what was on top of those stains.- The aromas of BO mixed in with the evenings vomit and pee and whatever else.The UGLY- Costly for public transportation.  Does the BART manager really need to be making 6 figures?  Then again, the BART drivers also make close to 6 figures and all they do is push a button all day!- Getting stuck at Bayfair station because I didn't read the fine print on the BART schedule; why does the last train only go 2 stops from Pleasanton?- Some dude who was hacking up a lung and spitting whatever into what look liked a Wall Street Journal.  Damn it was nasty!"
5,"Jan 14, 2008","I can't believe that during my 6 month stint in SF, I never got around to writing a review of BART, which totally saved my nondriving booty while I was out there!! My hotel was the Westin at SFO, which, while nice, was not exactly in the middle of the metropolitan mecca of SF, although I did have some great views of the runways.But, it did have a hotel shuttle to the BART station at SFO, kickass!! Got me in and out of SF as needed, and really, I have to give it 5 stars based on that alone. It's clean, it's quiet, and my mobile worked for most of the ride into the citaaaayyy!Yeah, the late night thing is way whack, I wish it was open later, but as I get around to more and more cities I realize NYC is an amazing and beautiful anomaly with cheap taxis AND a 24 hour public transport system. Of course, that only makes me love NYC more, but I can still give props to the other coast."
3,"Jul 24, 2015","Like other reviews before mine have stated, BART is kinda outdated and kinda expensive, but it gets the job done.  I used BART twice while in San Francisco to get to the city from the airport and back.  It took a few minutes to figure out what train to take and how much it would cost, but overall I would definitely use BART again if I ever found myself in San Francisco."
4,"Dec 4, 2008","Coming originally from the East coast, I was awestruck for years by the cleanness, 21st-century streamlined sci-fi modern-ness, speed and efficiency of the BART system.  The eerie howling and banshee-like screeching as the trains hurtle through blackness at lightspeed, with colored lamps flashing by, is ever so reminiscent of the end of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"".  The doors even make a cool sound when they close.  It's a world above the slow, prehistoric Boston subways in comfort, reliability, and convenience.Now that it actually IS the 21st century, though, the trains seem to be a bit worn and shabby, in need of new upholstery at least.  BART still stands up well considering it was built in the 1970's.They really badly need to update the ticket machines so there is some way to get a $4 ticket off a $20 bill and get change in bills or at least, $1 coins.  Currently change in this situation arrives as ** 64 QUARTERS ** cascading slot-machine style into a pile."
3,"Mar 3, 2010","I've been around the world, and I'm surprised that a city as wealthy and famous as San Francisco can have such a uniformly awful metro system. The only saving grace is that it's the only real decent subway system in the entire State, and after several months of living without one, you're like a starving man in the desert going after the twinkie. I'm also shocked at how expensive the tickets can be, especially for a working person who has to commute (I'm talking $200 a month for some commutes, and this isn't even an unlimited ticket); it's cheaper to drive even with the bridge tolls which is sad.It's very backwards when California heavily subsidizes its automotibles by building out of control freeways, then penalizes people who try to take public transpotation. The midnight closing time is also really ridiculous as well as the filthy fabric seats.I will give it three stars because there are some really nice views going from the East Bay into San Francisco. And the BART stations are some of the few places in California where people from all different classes and walks of life actually stand side by side. The people who ride the BART also tend to be thinner and healthier than car drivers."
4,"Jan 20, 2013","BART is pretty awesome! You can ride around SF or the surrounding areas for pretty cheap. Much better than the public transportation system we have in LA. The trains are generally clean and run until pretty late ( about midnight or so). WE use it to go from Fremont to the City pretty frequently and have almost always had a good experience. They have signs too so you know when the next train is coming. My only two problems with BART are I think it isa little expensive compared to other systems in other cities. Additionally, I don't really like the zone thing, I think it is a bit confusing and would prefer flat rate or day pass like NYC however I guess I can understand because of the space it covers and though I think it is confusing if you ride it the same route every day I guess you get the hang of it. :)"
3,"Jul 29, 2006","I don't know about that one. Yeah, it's reasonably fast. No, the cushiony seats don't inspire confidence. But here is what I really don't get: trying to buy a ticket, the machines don't ask you where the heck you're going,  but instead offer to print one or many tickets based on how much you've put in?  How illogical is this? This must be the first subway system in the world that does not ask you where you are trying to go, how many tickets you want to and then tell you how much you owe them. Of course, if I missed a step on their automated machines as I was rushing last night, yeah, go ahead and let me know, that will make me a smarter traveler next time."
3,"Nov 9, 2006","Why I like bart: I hate parking in SF, and driving in cities.The signs are nice at the stations - they tell you when the next train is coming. The signs aren't perfect though.You run later than Caltrain, and fairly frequently to boot. I like that.Why I hate bart: You get nowhere near golden gate park. In fact, you get to very little of San Francisco.You charge me a dollar fifty for a mile long ride from Caltrain Milbrae to SFO.Your schedule is imaginary.

The drone gets defining when you also learn that drivers make incredible wages for the way they slam doors on some people.Oh, well, we are used to being trumped and squeezed by the powers that be. No taxpayers revolt or San Francisco Bay Tea Partiers because it is now all just enclosed water under the bridge.

The train was also far less crowded then Chicago - almost peaceful in comparison.    A great cost effective way to get around.  I think a trip from the airport to out hotel in financial dist was about 9.00 - can't complain.
4,"Feb 20, 2008","Dear Bay Area Rapid Transit, You make me sleepy ,which is bad when I constantly miss my stops because I've nodded off. Sometimes creepy people look at me and rub their junk. Other times I look at people and silently judge them, they  may think I am trying to flirt, but I have a slight smile on my face when I am judging people so I could see how they would mistake it for flirting. Sometimes If I am feeling especially r-tarded, I like to take road trips with you. I will ride you all the way until the last stop and then go back and transfer to another train until I hit that routes last stop.

It cost $10.50 roundtrip on a Saturday, then I realized those that do use bart and have to pay that ridiculous $5 parking fee. That is $15 a day during the week! No wonder people are standing along the freeway entrances waiting for cars to come and jump in the car to carpool... That is straight up BANANA's.

5,"May 17, 2007","I love BART. I adore BART. BART is much cleaner than most public transportation systems. I once found two tickets tucked in between the seats. One was for $5 and the other was for $10. Did I use them? You bet!One night, I was trying to buy a ticket and it wouldn't take my last dollar, so I thought I would try to add fare at the Millbrae station. The Millbrae station wouldn't take my dollar either, so I talked to the attendant, who was in a good mood and let me go through without asking for money. Then she pointed out to me that since I walk with a limp, I should get handicap prices. Handicap pricing for BART tickets is half the price! Talk about a handicap-friendly business.And the other thing I love, which is more about the people than about BART, is that I have never had to stand in a crowded train because someone always offers me their seat. I'm not in a wheelchair, and I'm not really inconvenienced by standing, but I am not going to turn down a seat! I think this shows the caliber of people who commute on BART.BART is also safe and friendly and gets cleaned every time it's in Millbrae. In the east bay,"
5,"May 18, 2008","This is a mea culpa to BART.Years ago I mocked you for proclaiming to be ""the best transit system in America"". I was wrong. Today, in absence of a car, you take me around the bay area as needed - gparents, Target, SFO, etc, and you do it cheaper than driving would cost. You also let me ride for free in the city with my Muni pass.And this morning, even though your schedule says you don't start service till 8am, you ran trains early for Bay To Breakers.I was wrong about you, and I apologize."

Although you may not be consistently on time, have pungent scents, and occasional crazies, you take me from point A to point B efficiently and effectively. I commend you for preventing me from any unnecessary road rage if I were to drive to Giants, As, Raiders, Warriors games, Oakland airport, and SF airport. Thanks for being there for me when my paranoid self does not want to drive in stop and go traffic! To top it all off, I love you for being so darn close that I can literally roll out of bed and walk across the street 2 minutes before my train comes and rush in on time. =)P.S. This station has an abundant amount of parking for FREE (The most I've seen so far from the stations that I've been to) and a structure to shield your car!"
4,"Oct 2, 2008","San Diego would be a better place with a BART like system. We have the Trolley, which I love, but it seems to move at the speed of sound, where as the BART moves at the speed of light. You don't call the trolley ""rapid"" transit, but it's good enough I suppose.The BART has many advantages though. People use it because it goes to the right areas. It's not expensive. Basically, if you're a commuter in a central business district, the BART is the only way to travel--sometimes with a combination of other mass transit enterprises.I've used the BART on occasion and I have to say, it's not the best mode of transportation in the world, but it definitely beats sitting on the Bay Bridge for an hour in traffic."

Since then, its services have been increasingly erratic to the point where its customer ratings shoot through the roof when passengers manage to reach their destination the same day.In such a brave new world of worsening services in so many variables(cleanliness, engine trouble etc) is there an invariant, an absolute which is immune to change? The only such constant lies in the protection of redundant jobs and high paying salaries and perks of unionized BART workers."
3,"Aug 26, 2008","Dear BART,You are a necessary evil for those of us who need to get across the Bay. It would behoove you to make the following considerations realities:  1.  Cleaner trains.  Why, oh why, must you use upholstery on seats and carpet in your cars? If we need to give up comfort, I'd sit on cleaner plastic seating than a mystery soiled seat any day.  Visit other cities' public transit-like Portland's or even NYC's to see how much cleaner & more streamlined their trains are.  2.  Spare the Air Day.  What happened to this? Where is that West Coast progressiveness to lead our country to greener pastures & less emissions? 1 day this year versus 4 days last year?  3.  BART tickets.  If they get de-magnetized or whatnot, why are there at least 3 different responses on what you can do from agents?4.  Bonus.  You should reward passengers every now and then with an incentive to ride BART-free cups of coffee, BART rides, etc.... And who won that trip to Hawaii for filling out that lame survey anyway?Yours,A frequent BART rider"
2,"Sep 12, 2006","I really want to love BART, still do. I don't really mind the cost so much, but BART is really not extensive enough, so if you want to use it for your commute, chances are you will have to drive somewhere and park at a station (which is not always an available choice). And if you do have a BART Station with parking, the price can be pretty steep. You can expect to pay $84 a month for the privilege to get a parking spot before 10AM. If you live in the city, then you will have to cab or bus to a station, there isn't much available (let alone affordable) parking in the BART stations in the city.  I subtracted a second star because BART cars has these nasty cushions and carpets that are pretty gross -- you can smell the fact  that people sweat, barf, and piss on those things, and I am not sure that it is a great decision on the part of BART to have carpet and cheap cloth seat coverings. Why can't they just make it smooth plastic or metal, something easy to hose down and clean like in other major cities (e.g.: NY, London) where they have public underground transport ? BART gets another star less for its operating hours. For the most part, you have Cinderella syndrome when it come to travelling via BART -- you need to get there by midnight if you do not want to be stuck. The only time they operate long hours are when they shut down the bridge, and that is a real shame -- weekend traffic into the city suffers as a result of the short operating hours, in my opinion."
4,"Aug 7, 2008","Having never lived anywhere that any transit protocol other than driving was realistic, I was thrilled when I moved out to California and could take BART places. Nine years later and I'm still a pretty staunch defender. It's downsides are plenty - the lack of a late night schedule, the constant fare hikes, the occasional inexplicable delays, crowded old cars that may not be dirty but certainly aren't clean, to name a few - but once I finally made it to living in the city and working downtown, being able to knock out 85-90% of my travel needs for a $45 monthly pass is pretty great. I mean, I paid nearly $60 for one tank of gas last weekend. Given the reigns for a day I'd probably focus on non-absorbent seating, better air circulation and cooling, and providing people the means to get to or from the East Bay at night - at least 12th St to Embarcadero. I'd post the occasional reminder of good public transit etiquette so that locals aren't constantly groaning at tourists to walk left, stand right! or not stand in the ticket gate until your ticket is in hand, and in a perfect world I'd extend you all the way around the bay (even though I don't think it's your fault you're not) and cheapen your fares. Oh, and either more handles or lower overhead bars so that my girlfriend has something to hold on to please! But as a long-time rider with several thousand dollars of use over the years, I'd say you're doing a pretty decent job."
5,"Aug 27, 2009","Oh yeah, I did rode it again. Twice this month. From OAK via AirBus and to SFO. Still had a wonderful comfortable experience! Interesting people rides the BART as well... So it's a great place to people watch... And I just realized that BART can have as many as 10 cars per train. That is awesome! Even if it's a commuter train that runs all day long! The BART was about to go on strike on August 17 and I go back to Los Angeles on the 18th. ""Shit! Fuck me! God damn those stupid economic wreckers!"" All those thoughts (plus other not so nice thoughts) were what went through my mind when I read the front page or the Examiner on a Saturday afternoon on a MUNI train. I began to look for alternative route. Fortunately there's a bus route that does go into the airport or at least close enough. I never rode the bus because the Union leader agreed to a last minute deal which, at the time, have yet to be voted by the workers. I don't know if they agreed or not because I don't give a crap. California need to pass a law to ban public transportation workers from striking! Anyhoo. I was lucky I get to experience the BART again! *giggles*"
5,"Jul 5, 2009","Clean, effective, fast, frequent, and large seats! You can beat that, especially if it goes all over a metropolitan area! Maybe it works in San Francisco better than in Los Angeles because of the geographic shape... I can't wait to use it again this August!"
4,"Dec 11, 2009",I wish Los Angeles had public transit half as convenient as Bay Area BART. The Metrolink and AMTRAK are only about 1/8th as convenient.Go here for discount tickets:http://www.bart.gov/tickets/
3,"Apr 16, 2007","I don't ride BART much, but when I do, it gets the job done.Add an express route from Oakland to SFO and you'd get 5 stars from me (which is rare).On a side note, I've seen the video of the guy getting a blow job on BART, in plain view while people were watching.  Hilarious.  My man had no shame."
4,"Jul 3, 2009","BART ftw! Now if ONLY they improved cleanup of the trains and removed the freaking swarms of flies that gather at a couple of the stations.Oh, I almost forgot to mention lowering fares, but I guess that's an unattainable commuter dream."
5,"Aug 29, 2007","The BART HQ is in Oakland, located within Laney College vicinity. If you ever have complaints, send the guys working for it some mail. Everyone who gave this public transportation system 3 stars or less must be taking some dope drugs. Call me a silly wanker but BART is THE best commuting operation I've ever been a part of! I once tried applying for the BART Train Operator position, but that spot is harder than diamonds to get into... ANYWAY, I'll reiterate: BART is #1 in America imho!!!They're not that grimy (Cmon, what're you, afraid of a few germs?!? Worst affliction you can catch is possibly HIV, which is decimated soon as the virus hits O2 anyway.), they have free days (dubbed ""Spare the Air Day""), and they're the most convenient move you'll make when crossing the baaaaayyyyy areaaaaaaa!!! Additionally, AC and heating is provided. Now isn't that comfort or what? The plushy seats aren't bad either.Sure, their fares increase every year The Lord's present, but hey, when this snake is the metal beast covering the best climate case in the world, you had better shut your trap about whatever touchy feely problems you associate with it. They won the Best Public Transportation System Award in 2005 and completely deserved it! I am still a common user of BART, primarily for college."
2,"Jan 12, 2010","If you've ever lived on the East coast, you know what public transportation is supposed to look like. BART looks nothing like this. It basically goes in a line up Market to the airport and doesn't get you close to half of what you want to get close to. MUNI is good for this, but try getting to the Marina on BART. Not happening. Any other transport system might branch off, and even maybe branch to the south, hitting San Jose and Redwood City, and maybe even connecting via one of the other bridges... A circle would be nice. Convenient. Or help me out and get a shuttle from Alameda. Oh, and speaking of convenient, parking is not. West Oakland seems to be the place with the best chance of parking, but most of the lots are ticketed only or so small you just circle in frustration. Build some parking lots!Also, the seats are gross."
4,"Apr 9, 2006","I don't get the BART hate. For the past two years, I've taken BART everyday. I live 10 minutes (walking) from 24th St. and worked downtown. It served me well - I was never  late to work and  the longest it ever took was about 15 minutes. Usually, it came  right away and took about 7 to get to the Montgomery Station. There are far less crazies  than Muni and a 45 dollar fastpass gets  you anywhere in  the city. I've been driving everywhere, though, and  the last time I took BART, I got busted for my free ride. It's still fast and I'd take it if I weren't driving. Way better than the bus."
4,"Jul 31, 2008","All i have to say is thank god for the Bart. Because when you're staying at a friends house just outside the city on a road trip up North because you're too cheap to pay for a hotel, you're also too cheap to pay for the gas to drive into the city everyday along with the parking.  And also i'm sure i would have gotten ridiculously lost in my own car. (Not that I didn't walking around, but it was easier to figure that out, at least).  Talk about convenient. Sure, it could be cleaner. Yeah, it can get pretty crowded.  But as public transport goes, this was a great idea. My trip to San Francisco wouldn't have been the same without it. Oh yeah. And when you're coming back plastered, it's pretty fun and, again, CONVENIENT. Yay for minimizing drunk driving.  Minus the fact that they stop running around 12. But whatev. The BART is cool. The End."
1,"Dec 15, 2009","Yes Bart is good if you've never used public transit before and have nothing to compare it to.The last time I used the subway in LA though at least it was clean, on time and a roundtrip cost me like $3! Here, sure it goes more places and is easier to drive in a city that hates cars apparently but its still NOT GOOD.Its filthy, crowded, expensive.If you want good transit go to Japan and take a few notes, BART.I mean there are tiny little things they could do to make it so much better.And since I've been riding for 6 months now, I have had a major delay at least once a week.Way to go BART.Commence sarcastic clapping."
1,"Aug 18, 2009","Oh I wanted to like you and give you more than 1 star Bart. But...your stations are filthy, dingy and falling apart.You are festering with the homeless and hoodlums.Your workers are rude and incompetent.Why is it $4 one way and $4 back?Why, unlike all of the other major mass transits around the country...well in other countries too (I have experienced) is there no discounted round trip fare? Why is there no monthly, weekly or annual pass?Why do all students of all grades get discounts except college students?Furthermore, every stop has a sign saying which stop it is, but no sign saying what the previous was and what the next will be.This is common practice in LA, in Japan, in Germany...Why not on the famed Bart?Take a lesson from the others, clean up like the subway in LA and get the same kind of polite, helpful workers...and while your at it, take a look at the transit systems in the greater Tokyo metro area and see how to make a truly efficient and user friendly system!"
5,"Jun 2, 2010","The BART is amazing, especially since it goes to SFO now!  Easy, quick, convenient, inexpensive, and they have awesome parking facilities in Millbrae!  Slowly but surely, Seattle is building a light rail system... 30 years behind the curve."
3,"Oct 20, 2008",Given the fact that they Bay Area is one of the epicenters of liberal politics BART should run trains every five minutes 24 hours a day 7 days a week and all for free...As it is though it's way better than MUNI in San Francisco but not as nice as CTA in Chicago...
3,"Jun 17, 2005","When i was growing up out in the burbs, BART was and is still the end of the line. As a family we used to take BART to oakland or the city. When i moved to SF for college, i'd take BART back home to visit my parents. BART is fairly efficient - though sometimes from one end of the line to the other it can seem like it takes forever. On weekends not all BART lines are operating so you'll have to transfer either at downtown Oakland or Bay Fair station if your heading to stations in the southern alameda county. Finally after so many years - BART has a link to SFO - though its kind of kludgey since only some lines go to the airport. With the budget problems in Cali - will BART ever make it to San Jose? It took my entire life for BART to make it to SFO - so i'm not holding my breath. Plus how can you not love the BART gates and turnstiles with that modern swoosh sound... ?"
4,"Aug 29, 2006","Oh BART what would I do without you?  You started to charge for parking on weekdays...what is up with that?  If you commute then you can always score a parking spot, if you arrive late, good luck finding one.  But really, I love BART because it saves me the hassle of parallel parking in the city, or better yet, shelling out megabucks to park my car in a structure.  I take BART whenever I can despite the fact that it's one of the most expensive transportation systems in the US, I will continue to ride as long as you let me.  Now if only people didn't jump on the tracks and cause stalls, you'd be the perfect solution to our traffic problems.  I know for a fact traffic here would be MUCH worse if it weren't for this lovely train.  Oh and if you ran later than midnight, you'd really be a great deal.  Sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride."
3,"Jan 5, 2006","BART's cool but it gets costlier every year.  I mean, I don't have a problem with that.  Once upon a time, I was dazzled by the idea that all the lands I could possibly fancy are just a trainride away. With this in mind, though, I'd like not to have to sit in a seat that smells like urine, I'd like not to have to see the man across from me wanking off behind his newsie, and I'd like for the train not to stall while operators stalk up and down the cars shouting, ""Does anyone smell gas?  Does ANYONE - smell - GAS?!!"" Because that shit kind of unsettles me.  But I guess that's life. It does have its moments, though.  One time a guy played his guitar and sang the whole ride home.  That was cool."
5,"Jan 2, 2008","Being away from the Bay, I forget how much I love BART, it is ridiculously clean compared to transit in many other cities around the world and the US I've been to, and you gotta love the cushy seats and the no-graffiti interiors and the lush views of the bay when I'm visiting my parents.We used it on NYE to go ONE stop to Embarcadero because my cousins were wearing heels. It was fun and great and clean and easy, although my instinct was to call a cab, my family told me that it's not as frequent as NY so we needed Bart. So easy.So, it's great for just one stop, or for 16 stops if you're going to go all the way to Fremont or to Berkeley or wherever, my experiences with Bart have always been fantastic...well, maybe except that smelly guy sat next to me, but other than that, it is the closest thing I've experienced to the perfect public transit experience, ever."
1,"Jul 14, 2006",BART should get no stars until it extends limited service to all stations until 2 AM on weeknights and 4 AM on weekend nights.Phooey on this. And phooey on BART Police.
1,"Jan 3, 2007","I ride the BART 2 times daily from SF to Oakland.  There always is the usual pan handler and homeless person roaming the stations.  There is always the odd smelling person seated close enough to smell, but not close enough to actually see or detect whom it is.  There is always the stains seat and trash on the ground, but today's morning ride to work really was an experience...The two bench seats facing each other were in visible distance from my seat.  My IPOD (a BART essential) was blasting away as I read the morning paper.  A normal day until...A man seated in one of the bench seats had his bag resting on the seat adjacent to him.  A lady (if you can call her that) proceeded to move his bag to sit down.  Keep in mind the opposing bench seat was completely empty.  The man then reacted and started yelling obscenities at her and asking her why she didn't just sit in the empty bench.  This seemed to make the women to want to sit in the seat next to him more.  He then got up and started a confrontation and spit in her face.  She then pulled out a knife and started swinging it around.  The train stopped at my stop and I carefully but swiftly exited.  Complete craziness.  I mean I've seen druggies throw up blood in the BART train before, but someone pulling a knife over a seat is just ridiculous."
2,"Jan 29, 2009","I freaking hate BART.  Not only is it more expensive for me than driving, but, when I try to do the right thing and take BART instead of driving to Berkeley, it usually ends up costing me even more.  The tickets get demagnetized SO easily, unlike Muni passes, and then the BART employees make me buy another ticket.  Once, I made a fuss and the BART employee offered me a form to get a refund on my demagnetized $35 ticket instead.  I filled it out, and gave her my ticket, but have not seen a dime of that money in several months.   BART makes being green a hassle.  2 stars for usually being on time."
3,"May 2, 2006","BART-it's better than MUNI.If I were in the marketing department at BART, that would be the tagline.  Since I'm not, let me air my grievances.  First and foremost is that there is not a monthly pass option.  Why is that?  I go to the same places every day.  I'm willing to pay extra for trips that don't go to work or the boyfriend's house, but this isn't even an option. Secondly, why is it so hard to find a ticket machine that takes credit cards?  God forbid you find a machine that miraculously does, you're screwed when your phone demagnetizes it and a huge, arduous process designed exclusively to be aggravating is involved in getting your money back (and this never happens when you have fifty cents on a ticket, it only happens when there is a small fortune on there)Now, the upside.  Fast and frequent-a train comes by about every three minutes during rush hour from Oakland to SF.  Most days, I get a seat which I also like.  No doubt iPods were created by someone who rides public transit, and I kinda, um, enjoy starting my day off on BART."
1,"Jun 23, 2015","Bart sucks. Anyone who's lived in the East knows how efficient a public transit system can be. The bart sucks. There aren't enough trains for passengers, the smell or are to hot and are never on schedule. My life is consistently slowed to a grinding halt because the doors won't open at a stop, the train stops in the middle of nowhere for no reason or it just rains to much and train traffic is created. WHAT is train traffic??? With all the people packed on the trains you'd think BART only has 4 trains running in the entire system. Finally, BART SUCKS!"
3,"Nov 3, 2009","BART is a timely, clean, reasonably efficient, reasonably quiet way to get between select major destinations in San Francisco and the East Bay during the daytime. Expansion plans to the rest of the Bay Area, which will obviate the need to transfer amongst other major public transport systems like Caltrans, may finally alleviate the requirement of owning a car in the Bay Area, but in the meantime, it's a cluster of 'planes, trains, and automobiles' for getting around town.Short answer: if BART goes precisely between your start and end, and parking is going to be a problem, take it.FYI, BART's ticket machines often fail to take credit card, and the make-shift merchants who set up shop in their stations surcharge for the payments by CC, in violation of e.g. Visa's policies."
3,"Feb 9, 2006","Dear BART,I have spent three years of my life commuting from the Sunset to Oakland riding on you. I feel like I might as well have lived in you. Now that I have a new job and no longer need to commute to the East Bay, I find that I don't really miss you that much. I did like that time I was on and that really cracked out guy dropped his crack pipe and everyone in the vicinity got really quiet. That was great. I have a complaint, BART. Why do you have to stop at midnight? I'm a girl who likes to go out and when my friends need to leave early in order to catch the last train, well that just makes me sad. We have had a good run, but I think it's time to move on.Love, JackieP.S. You smell kinda bad too."
4,"Dec 17, 2007","Oh BART... the minute I stepped foot on you and inhaled that mix of pee and feet, and heard that screaming tunnel echo that sounds like we are headed for the seventh level of hell, it felt like coming home.Why oh why can't Seattle have a mass rapid transit system like you? I will never look at a local Metro bus the same.You're quick, and cheap, and everything I ever wanted in a man. Err, I mean, in a ride. Wait.. that didn't sound much better.Seriously though-I'll miss you."

4,"Aug 7, 2008","Everything is relative.  BART is not:* a flying car* maglev* a teleportation device* immune to natural disasters or human errorIt is also not BART's fault that some of the riders are dirty, crazy, rude, drunk, high, or too stupid to operate the ticket machines, and let's face it, better that most of these people ride BART than attempt to operate a motor vehicle (although, in truth, most of the worst offenders are probably Muni drivers).BART is:* usually on time* frequent* relatively clean and comfortable* much more pleasant than drivingThere is certainly room for improvement, especially with regard to AirBART, and it would be just fabulous if BART would run until after 2:00 AM (i.e., after the bars close), hence only a four-star rating.Also, BART employees are usually reasonably polite and helpful, unlike their counterparts on Muni (see BART passenger description, above) or Caltrain, where the conductors would as soon push you under the train as have you ride it.  BART's Web site, especially for cell phone users, is far superior to any other Bay Area transit system's, with an accurate and intuitive trip planner.  BART has one of the best public transit ratings in the country, and it deserves it!"
4,"Oct 2, 2011","BART does a great job being what it is. There's absolutely no other decent public transportation line in California, and people who defund mental hospitals housing unfortunate schizophrenics like to howl and do the NIMBY thing because stuff like BART would bring ""those homeless people"" into their property value neighborhood.But gee-1. what's with the monorail thing? that's why it costs so much to build it right?2. the early closing hours are blatantly classist and creepy3. the prices - i've been around the world baby (neneh cheery) and I've never seen such an awful system subsidzing the rich while attacking the poor. what's the deal? why does riding the BART from Oakland cost decent hardworking people $200 + a month? it's really crazy. I lived in NYC for several years and even in that den of sin and spending there was a consistently affordable unlimited pass with 24 hour service for under $80 a month in my day. I think only London is more outrageously expensive, but larger world class cities like Paris were always providing decent unlimited passes at reasonable prices!Why does so much money keep getting poured into widening roads and a subsidizing lots of selfish people who throw a fit when there are carpool lanes? This is something that needs to be subsidized but I guess I can understand why people are leery of that due to the crazy amounts that get spent whenever there's a cool civic project in SF. There are people working 4 jobs and they have families where their partner is working too and they can't afford health insurance for their kids. I don't get why BART costs so much but freeways cost so little. I realize that there's subsidized pubilc transportation though so that is cool!Are the taxes really so high like I always hear people complaining? Are businesses really going out due to taxes or is that a lame excuse for crappy management or bad business decisions? Don't we have some of the lowest taxes in the industrialized world? Also, I don't understand this wimpy refusal to ride the BART. Oh wait, i do--OK, BART, I love you but what's with those cloth seats? They're intense! BART workers are cool though. And they finally got the clipper program through!I keep seeing so many excuses that ditch public transportation, with so little foresight or acknowledgement that the world's supply of petroleum is going to price skyrocket very soon. BART needs to be #1 or #2 on transportation funding priorities since it's a long term thing,r ight? Also, what's this childish stuff about BART ""not paying off."" Freeways are free and they ""don't pay off"". Oh man, BART, i love you but the persecution of bicycles has to stop. That's such a terribly policy. SF and Berkeley and Oakland are perfect to travel around in sans car with a bike. What's with this ridiculous no bikes on the train during rush hour stuff? I feel like it unfairly favors financial district workers, who are nice people but bicyclists typically require fewer buses and save us money more than walkers do. [copying the argument from he Caltrain bicyclist mafia)please stop attacking BART thoughtlessly. Note that there's a crucial lack of regional government in the SF Bay Area, with a lot of municipalities (enabled by car driving) wanting to have their cake and eat it too without throwing in their fair share of funding for all the wonderful things that being in a major city brings them."
1,"Sep 5, 2015",BART usually doesn't function when I need it. Today I needed to go to the city but of course the tracks are out of service to SF. Instead they offer us Muni busses with NO AIR CONDITIONING. It's so hot in this bus. You think that Bart would pony up some quality service for its riders given the prices we pay. What are we paying for? An outdated train that is barely comfortable? Major disappointment. This is America 2015.
4,"Jul 28, 2011","I've been using BART since the early 80s. And I must say that for a transit system, it is pretty darn good. It got me to various schools, to San Francisco, to both local airports, to work, to meet up with friends,... The seats are padded (and as my European sister-in-law mentioned, pretty wide to accompany fat, American asses).Things I won't miss:a.) People who pretend to sleep on BART so that they won't have to give up their seats for pregnant women or the elderly or disabledb.) The guy who brushed his teeth on BART and spit his wastes into a discarded Chronicle (back when newspapers used to litter the trains before everyone got smart phones)c.) The guy who was obviously jerking off under yet another Chronicle over his lapd.) The guys who used specific stops for their drug deals e.) The week-long BART strike that made me take 3 different AC Transit buses over 3 hours to get to workf.) That irritating BART driver who would pronounce Ashby as Sssssshhhhby."
4,"Jul 15, 2011","In the course of packing up for our move, we found about 30 BART tickets with various tiny amounts on them. We couldn't decide between donating them, or using them for last-minute errands. Since they added up to about $2, I decided to be selfish.The window is located at the spot that used to house all of the bike parking. The woman exchanged my ticket without question. Actually, the only question she had was if I had a nickel, as the total amount was $1.95. They only exchange tickets to the nearest dollar. There was a sign saying they only exchange tickets that were not purchased by credit card. I don't know how to tell how my tickets were purchased. She didn't say otherwise.Hours are very limited: Wednesdays from 10:00-01:30, and from 02:45 to 06:00."

4,"Nov 14, 2011","I'd doubt that BART is one the premier rapid transit systems in the world, but it does show the U.S. what a comprehensive transportation system can do to connect communities with the major metropolitan areas. Whenever I fly in to SFO and need to get into the city, you can bet you'll see me with my bag on the BART ready to get in the city in an efficient and reliable time frame. Running over 100 miles, it connects far flung areas of the bay area, from Berekley to SFO, Fremont to San Fran. It makes it easy to find a reliable way to get from one point to another. It's stations are clean and well organized, while the trains are comfortable with plush seating.The routes are priced depending on how far you are going on the system, however it offers a very good cost-effective option! Oh, when waiting for the train, be sure to wait behind the yellow line and the black marks note where the doors will match up!"
3,"Dec 6, 2012","I rode BART twice for the first time. Quick Impressions: Poor signage, but once you figure out the system, tickets etc this is a fairly small and simple train set up. The trains are noisy and old. There are no table or wifi---this is plain vanilla, mostly underground transportation. The stations are pretty dimly lit and it would have seemed BART could have thought of some public/private better space utilization for the stations. This felt like safe transportation and was a fraction of Cabs or rental cars."
3,"Jan 29, 2013","Convenient, quiet and fast mode of transportation around the bay area.B-rilliantA-ccessibleR-eliableT-imelyThe only downsides are that the trains are only semi-frequent and people don't let you get off the train before trying to bundle in.Then there's the stickiness on some trains due to incorrect use of carpet and same material on seats (nasty!) although newer trains have gone more plasticy which helps."
3,"Jan 23, 2013","BART is good. BART is bad.If you are not feeling like driving into the city, then it's nice to have BART as an option.It's reasonably priced and reasonably quick. It's also fairly frequent and usually on time which is nice.But there are downsides, sometimes the trains are sticky/humid when you get on which just feels nasty.Then some of the non-refurbished trains have the grossest looking stained material on the seats. Carpet on the floor inside? Whose idea was that?At least on the newer trains they use vinyl or some similar material (easier to spot nastiness) on the seats and floor which helps.This is a bit unrelated, as it's not BART's fault per se, but what gives with people trying to get on the train before riders have gotten off? I'm all for wanting to get a seat but let people off first?! Unfortunately this was not a 1 time experience and seems to happen much too frequently. Rant over.Averaging BART makes it ok, has good things, has bad things."
1,"Sep 11, 2006","BART is the dirtiest, smelliest, nastiest, loudest speeding bullet!Between the stench of the overworked employees, to the cracked out dry skinned scratcher with skin flakes flying all over the god damn place, to the morning breath folks who don't brush their teeth, to the OVERPRICED FARES!One star for getting me to and from San Francisco. :-P You suck BART!"
1,"Jul 27, 2016","It's ""spare the air"" day and I would have loved to spare the air and not drive 200 miles for 2 round trips  x 5 days this week. I was willing to pay more (my car is cheaper to drive) and even spend a bit more time (driving the route is quicker) and take BART but there is NO parking available near Fremont BART unless I want to walk 20 mins one way which I don't have time for. If you really want people to take public transit, make it easier and cheaper to use!"
2,"Jan 9, 2009","BART is a useful and fairly reliable form of local public transportation that could severely stand to be expanded and improved.My low rating is merely a reflection of it wasted potential.-Trains should certainly run later if not 24 hours. There will always be riders.-Coverage should loop within SF. Although a massive undertaking in infrastructure, connecting Castro/Haight/Sunset/Richmond/Russian Hill would supplement ridership substantially.And then there is that whole second guessing over whether or not you are going to get preemptively SHOT by BART Police. Apparently they don't need a reason, so if a man lying on the ground is a threat imagine what they think of you the rest of the time? Just standing on the platform, you start to look like Lee Harvey Wilkes-Boothe Hitler."
3,"Aug 1, 2013","I'm typing this review, as I am riding the BART into San Francisco. While I haven't used the service in months, I depended on it religiously my freshman year of college to bring home on weekends. Trains usually arrive every 15 minutes on weekdays and every 20 on weekends, which is fine (even though it doesn't quite reach Rio De Janeiro's one-bus-every-10-seconds). They try their best to clean their compartments, but most of the old seats are littered in stains and are breeding grounds for bacteria (Apparently, according to a NYT article, the seats are soiled in ""fecal and skin-borne bacteria."" Yuck.) Fortunately, these are being replaced by new, coated seats that are easier to wipe down. BART will also be replacing all compartments with next-generation ones soon, which I find exciting.Now, the bad: While I've usually been able to work in peace on the train -- it's not the NY subway -- you should expect your fair share of solicitations: Panhandlers making their way through the entire train, compartment by compartment, are not all that uncommon. Sometimes they'll stop in your compartment and start shouting at everyone. BART also closes at midnight every night, which is annoying. I understand that they need to close shop from 12-4 a.m. for maintenance, but couldn't they do this from 2 to 6 a.m. on weekends at least? I know that this is not BART's fault per se, but it's also frustrating that it takes 2 to 3 hours (sometimes more on weekends) by public transit to get from Berkeley to Palo Alto. Quick, someone build that Hyperloop."

The two ladies talking in a very annoying language very loudly so the whole car can hear and not understand anything they are saying.4.  The suit closing a deal on his cell phone just before entering the tunnel, conversation getting louder ""hello.. hello... hello?!?""  Then looking at his phone like WTF just happened??5.

4,"Jan 21, 2008","BART is great for getting where you need to go and minimizing the environmental impact.  yay!some quick hits on changes:  1.  switch ticketing policy to honor code.  in germany, you purchase tickets, but there are no turnstiles.  enforcement policy is random checks.2.  get wifi lines through the caldecott tunnel and under the bay.3.  displays out to the parking lot on when the next train arrives... it'd  be nice to know when i should be hustling to make the train.4.  ALL NIGHT trains!!!  is it really cost prohibitive to have a train run every 30 minutes?!"
4,"Jul 9, 2009",It's funny how morning riders have this look like they're riding to their deaths.. lolOther than that I wish it ran 24/7 this would keep the DUI's down. Also it wouldn't hurt to bring the price down.
2,"Dec 19, 2008","There's nothing worse than having to stand up for an entire 45-minute commute home after work.  Unfortunately, this happens waaaaay too often for me.  San Francisco to Fremont trains are crowded and only come every 15 minutes.  It's hot and uncomfortable and makes me wish I could drive to work.  It would also be nice if BART riders were more courteous.  There's no need to talk on your cell phone so loudly, or listen to music without headphones (or, for that matter, play it so loudly that people can hear it through your headphones).  Just let other people ride in as much peace as we can."

Our subways are squeaky clean and $1.25 to go anywhere, but BART has better coverage. I gave the system an extra star for convenience and ease of getting to the airport, which cost an outrageous $16.20. I have to mention that SF as a whole has sensational PT."
2,"Feb 21, 2011","In summary, BART behaves like a smalltown rail, but it supposed to serve the Bay Area. It is nasty, it has very little coverage of the Bay and its operating hours are way too short. It needs to grow up.I don't even know where to start....Upholstered seats is plain gross, especially in a society with many people with no upbringing, who spit, pee and shit all over it.Coverage sucks. Having traveled to places like Tokyo or NY, there's no comparison. BART just has a stupid giant U route with like 4 variations. It doesn't even begin to cover the Bay Area. One route in SF is immature at best. It should branch off into at least 3 directions including a crosstown service. Now, you either go up or down! There's only one crossover point too from east bay to SF. Bootleg!East bay is the same, with only two branches heading north and two heading south, sharing the same route most of the time. Shit is ghetto.Uptime is stupid too. They stop running around midnight. This is an international city people, grow up!And stupid Sunday service starts at 8am. How lame is that? Try to catch an early morning flight at SFO with that bullshit! Who is them to decide that no one else in the bay need to do shit before 8?The management needs to take a field trip to NY or Tokyo or something to see how to set up and run a proper grown public transportation system."
2,"Jul 12, 2016","I really like the convenience of BART. Not always on time - cost about the same as driving, gas tolls.  i can even get an occasional nap.My problem- - - Dogs.  The dog policy - or the lack thereof - of course the seeing eye dogs are allowed.  That's everywhere, that's law. Besides, they are by the door in the area designated to people who may need seating.   It's the personal, leashed dogs.  I am a paying customer just like the pet owner.  I am allergic to dogs. Since that one person started, there's the snowball effect.  There are, of course, those pet owners who are understanding and will move when I ask.  But, on the other hand, I've been met with more and more attitude when I let the person with the dog know that I'm allergic. ""Oh, I'm sorry - I do like to itch, sneeze, cough and scratch.  It builds character"". With my allergy - I guess I have to pop a few Zyrtec prior to boarding.My question is why must I be the one to make the compromise?I've spoken to station agents who can't do anything because of the unenforced regulation.  Some of them have allergies.  I was told to contact the Board of Directors.  I did.  They told me that although dogs are allowed, they have to be in a portable cage.  Purses, backpacks and bags are not acceptable.  Not on or off leashes.Someone told me that if the Board gets enough calls - it may make a difference.  CALL people CALL."
2,"Jun 22, 2006","B.A.R.T is free this morning!  Wish I knew that before I purchased my ticket.  Spare the Air Day is always such a bitter sweet surprise.

4,"Jul 18, 2006","Very fast, clean and there's usually another one in a couple of minutes. It's a first class system.Only 2 downsides: - information is not so helpful. Every time I go to Walnut Creek I forget what line to take. You then have to jump on, and then scan the map. I know it's not the Dublin line.-going to the airport, you always have to wait for ages for the 1 in 3 trains going all the way. There's always collection of people with luggage at Balboa Park watching half empty trains going to Daly City."
1,"Jul 10, 2010","If I could give BART less then 1 STAR I would. I have since boycotted BART after the Johannes Mehserle verdict. My reason?1. Why does ANY transit agency (especially in a relatively safe area of the country) need to arm their ""police"" with lethal weaponry like GUNS!2. Why does ANY transit agency that gives tasers to their ""police"" not train their ""police"" for more then 6 hours on how to use non-lethal force.3. Why does a WHITE cop that kills an unarmed BLACK man only get Involuntary Manslaughter when the videos show he pulled his gun, aimed and executed someone with intent of malice. Sorry BART but I boycott you, urge others to do the same, and will vote AGAINST any future funding I have a say in, even if it destroys Caltrain or MUNI or other much needed transit agencies - beside, your system is 40 years old and has never upgraded."
5,"Feb 3, 2008","BART has its ups and downs. Its ups were in the 80's and early 90's, its downs are later 90's and today. Unfortunately, the price of tickets being higher, does not stop people I define as ""trash"" from boarding. People who have no real use for BART other then to sit, waste electricity, and put on a show for everyone else. Fortunately, I also have a sense of humor and find that fun to poke fun at. I can totally laugh about it, cause when I was 14, I used to take BART from ONE END to ANOTHER. I was so bored, I would wonder EVERY station AT LEAST ONCE in a week time, sometimes TWICE. Today, I take BART cause 8 minutes from Balboa Park to Powell is 45 to 60 on MUNI (yes, thats on the efficient J Train in traffic). I take BART cause I dont have time to waste to get home and try on all my new clothes I bought in downtown, which I DARE not try in a dressing room. Are you kidding? Have you seen the people in downtown that are lurking to rape you? HAH!My favorite part about BART, and I RARELY get to see this, cause I never pay the extra Trans-Bay Tube fare is enjoying the ""..included in the price..peepshow, Tunnel Of Love""! Most BART commuters pretend to not notice, but EVERYONE knows what the hell Im talking about. Its the people who get naked, who make out excessively, the people who give hand massages (with happy endings), and those who just get the quick ""SCREW"" on in that last car of the BART trains.....whilst it travels the 3.2 miles underwater in complete darkness outside, but bright florescent lighting in the cars. You think you cant see, and you dont want to see, but you cant help it, the reflection on the glass is blindingly clear!It really is cheap entertainment, but totally trashy. I think its cheaper then the peep shows in SF. The best trains to see this action.... Richmond to Daly City lines, generally at night, evenings. That my friends is why BART gets a 5 STAR RATING!"
3,"Mar 8, 2011","Two gripes.First, the prices are way too high.  Cut employee salarys and lower ticket prices.Second, service should run after midnight on the weekends.  Even if it is limited, it would prevent people from getting on the road after drinking."
4,"Mar 25, 2011","These four stars are dedicated to the overly sexual copule that sat behind me...Imagine a couple in their 30's, dressed professionally, talking in baby voices. I sit down on the squishy, brown tinged seat and pull my hood up to avoid having my nice smelling hair touch the greasy head rest. My ears pick up the sound of *muah..  smoochy smoochy..* The smooches turn to loud sloppy kisses.Woman: OOooOH My my.. What a large pretzel you have there.. ** They didn't have any pretzels on them.. So i can only assume otherwise..Woman: Damn IT! I'm wearing the wrong bra! I should've worn the one that unhooks in the front!Man: Yeah Baby.. yeah..yeaahWoman: You know we don't have to get off the train to get off.. *loud slurping noises*I put my earphones in and tried to sleep. Didn't work. Other than that, BART IS EFFICIENT. They are almost always on time unless there is severe weather and/or BART Police running amok."
1,"Mar 29, 2009","I would strongly caution you to NOT park at long-term parking at any BART station. My car was recently stolen from their garage in Millbrae while I was out-of-town via SFO.Thinking I would save a couple of bucks, I used long-term parking at BART. Returning to the station 7 days after my departure, I found no car, thinking (hoping) I was jet lagged and absent-minded, I asked the station agent, who informed me after a couple of minutes on the phone with BART Police, with a grin that he could not hide, that my vehicle was reported stolen by BART 5 days after I had parked it at Millbrae!Takeaway Points:1.) Don't use long-term parking at BART. If you do, instead of posting your proof of payment on your car, instead post a sign that says, ""My car will be parked here for several days and nobody's really looking. Would you like to steal it?""2.) Pay a few bucks extra per day and park your car in a long-term lot for SFO that has intimidating-looking barbed-wire fences and an attendant whom a would-be thief would have to encounter.3.) Find the humor in life."
4,"Jun 6, 2010","Been using BART from the time I was in middle school - very convenient and environmentally-friendly alternative to driving. I appreciate this, as I try to avoid driving as much as I can. With a few exceptions, the trains have come in a frequent and timely manner and I've thankfully never been involved in a train having an accident. I'd normally love to give this business a 5, but cannot justify it based on the following:* restrooms need improvement in cleanliness* certain BART stations are not in very safe locations (e.g. West Oakland)* excursion fare is rather pricey (more than $4.00) - I think I understand that this allows a person to ""tour the system"" within 3 hours for a fairly cheap price, but what about the person who forgets something and needs to exit the same station within seconds/minutes of entering? Maybe there should be a timestamp, in that the excursion fare only applies after, say, 20 min but not before. I don't think it costs too much money/energy to process a single entry/exit, so it may be okay to not charge excursion for people needing to immediately exit. I just find it hard to justify excursion fare in this case, esp. as I've seen the overall BART prices going up."
1,"Nov 1, 2012","WHY, WHY, WHY!?!? Why is it that riding BART during regular commuter hours to and from SF and Lake Merritt HAS to be such an unpleasant experience of crowded, HOT TRAINS!? Why is it that unless we go at some odd, off time that a person has no hope to EVER have a seat or even wiggle room!? Seriously BART, is it because you have a captive rider base? I have been taking this route for 2.5 years and it is rediculous! Does one need to move to one end of the line and work at the other to ever hope of getting a seat!? Why can't you run more or longer trains! I am sure you could run a computerized simulation to figure it out. NO EXCUSE. SOOOO FRUSTRATING!Trapped Consumer of Public Transportation"
4,"Nov 23, 2007","I like BART.  They give discounts if you buy in bulk ($4-$3 off for purchasing $60 or $45).  They give free rides.  They spare the air.  Carpetted floors and seats might be gross, but it's only for a short while.  It's nasty when people clip their nails, file their dead skin or groom but that's not BART's fault.  Funny coastal difference: NYers are nice b/c they wake you up if you're zonked out when the train pulls into grand central, but SFans are nice 'cause they let you sleep through your stop.  You see weird shit like the guy with a pet albino rat(!!).  But it's more peaceful than MUNI where loser boys are reciting ""this great [love] poem I wrote"" to a friend that we all have to painfully endure... Caltrain is neat, clean, snooty, and hella loud!  No wonder, the cars were made in Japan 1985; could use an upgrade.  Chances of delay seems less likely than BART but their stops w/in SF are inaccessible.Capitol Corridor is like an airplane on rails; even better actually.  But you'd only use them to get out of the BA. BART rocks.  So there you go.  4 for 1."
1,"Jan 18, 2018","A friend of mine was attacked today on Bart around 11:00 Am at Bay fare station. The crime was committed by a white male in his 20's.

4,"Apr 22, 2006","EDIT: Recently I've embraced, new, brave Katie.  New Katie is hardly scared of BART at all (though she would like a cute boy to hold her hand while going through the Bay tunnel).  My only major complaint now is that the tunnel hurts my ears a lot.  I think I must have very sensitive ears because it doesn't seem to bother other people.   -------- The subway in NY doesn't bother me at all and the Metro in Paris is actually fun.  But something about the possibility of being stuck underground in the event of an earthquake has made me avoid BART at all costs.  Recently though, I had to fly out of SFO and the thought of paying for a cab superseded my fear of BART. I have to admit that it wasn't horrible.  It arrived on time and was fast enough.  But why do we need all the tunnels?  It was so loud in them that I could barely hear the person next to me.  Plus it's was more than unnerving to have the train make such a godawful noise while you can't see a damn thing outside of the car.  One good thing about all that was that by the time I got to the airport i was so excited to get off of BART that I hardly even cared about getting on the airplane (which seemed mighty safe, quiet, and comfortable in comparison)."

3,"Jan 24, 2012","BART = Overrated....Supposedly the BART is better than Los Angeles' public transportation system.For one thing. It is far easier to get your tickets in Los Angeles. The BART ticket machines are not very user friendly. Once you get the hang of them they are not so bad but still. In LA the ticket machines are far easier to use even when you are using them for the first time. Part of the reason it is difficult to use the BART machine is due to the fact you need to see how much it costs to get to your destination. After this you fiddle with buttons to tell the machine how much you have to pay. If you are a first timer you will take a great deal of time figuring out how to do this and it probably annoys the locals haha! I've seen bewildered people ask how to use these machines. I've seen bums help passengers out when they spot their bewildered faces.In LA you can get a day pass, a week pass or a monthly pass for most of Greater LA at the machines. I do not think you can get that from the BART machine. I'm pretty sure you can't. You need to get tickets or passes for the SF MUNI system elsewhere. As far as I know, you can get a pass for both BART and the MUNI but this is definitely not at the machines.I have heard people brag about how efficient BART is here in LA. I always believed them since I know how long you need to wait for buses in LA and since I know that some of the train runs are few and far between. When you think about it though LA is massive and the Frisco peninsula is narrow. Kind of hard to be inefficient there. Considering how massive LA is I actually have more respect for our public transportation system. i do have to give BART credit for their cushy seats though haha! They are far more comfy than the seats in LA!The worst thing about BART is that it is NOISY as heck during some parts of your journey. In any case, BART is good enough for me. However, it is a lesson in appreciating LA more. No, BART isn't better and the NYC subway isn't better either. On the BART we were talking about charming stories regarding the huge rats in the NYC subway system haha! My favorite NYC subway story is one about a bum that was sleeping on a passenger bench while these immense rats were nibbling at his feet. Priceless! LA is the place!!!!"
3,"Jun 6, 2007","Bart is the definition of a love-hate relationship.Love it because:*It gets me where I need to go (kind of)*It allows me to reduce my driving to 2wice a monthHate it becasue:*It stops it midnight.

4,"Sep 4, 2009","Being someone from Boston, where the subway system is woefully inadequate, I must say that BART is one of my favorite transportation systems in the country.  The seats are cushiony, comfy (similar to the DC Metro), and provide ample room.  Plus you can catch the BART right in SFO (just like the tube at Heathrow).  But the big thing for me is the announcement system- there are screens that tell you *exactly* when the next few trains are coming.  You have no idea the public transport envy I feel when I come to the Bay Area or London and see that.  It screams efficient.Hence, I love the BART.  It is expensive, as other reviewers have pointed out, but it is a sweet ride."
4,"Jul 22, 2010","Dear BART, you talked to me today and had me all freaked out for a total of 2 minutes!  It's nifty that you've implemented an automated teller to repeat how much dinero one puts in the ticket machine, but it's also a bit scary.  I don't really understand the purpose, but this is me assuming that all deaf/mute/blind people don't benefit.  Anyhoo, although your trains don't come too often and you have YET to go to San Jose, you are the bomb for transporting my carless self from Berkeley to Fremont most weekends during college, and now from SF to Oakland/Fremont whenever I randomly need to go visit friends and family.  I don't really understand why you are ravaging Lake Elizabeth in order to make the extension to Warm Springs, but if you promise to have her back to her normal self by the time you're done with whatever it is you're doing, I'll forgive you for the inconvenience of having to walk around detours in my favorite place.  Thank you for all the good times, interesting characters and entertainment too.  If only you had cops that didn't shoot innocent people under the mistaken premise of grabbing tasers, I'd really really like you and maybe give you 4.5 stars.  Be careful about who you keep in your company because you eventually become them.  Peace."
1,"Oct 28, 2008","The only reason I ever rode Bart is because it got me from point A to point B.  Period. Well, I take that back.  The second reason is because the cost of driving downtown would cost me 2 craps and a whistle to park my ride.  Thank god I don't work in the FiDi anymore!Onward....The Good - Like I said, it got me from A to B.  The Bad - The trains smell like ass and they look just as bad.  It's in need of a serious overhaul and for the amount of $ that they pull in, they should be able to afford it.  Not only that, but any old stank-ass vagrants can ride it and you don't know if the person that was sitting in your seat before you is one of them!  Nasty stuff.  You have no idea WHAT was in that seat or what germs and nasty sh*t was left behind, unknown to the naked eye.  The Ugly - They should change the name to FART.  Because as far as I can tell, it has all the makings of a fart.  Sometimes it creeps up on you and sometimes it just blows right on by.  Either way, it just plain 'ol stinks."

3,"Sep 8, 2006","Oh, BART.  What does it tell you about BART that I every time I sit down, I quickly check the seat with my hand to make sure it's not wet?  Day in, day out, checking the seats.  BART is costly and not particularly time effective, but if I want to go to work, I ride.  I've never been delusional enough to think I get my money's worth ($7 a goddamned day!  That's over a 1/2 hour of work!), but here's a piece of a conversation I overheard between 2 BART employees a few days after the threatened ""we want more money"" strike:Employee 1: Man, I make more money in a week than any of my friends!  They're hella jealous!Employee 2: Me too, man!  I make more a week than my brother makes a month!  He's always like, damn man!The only thing that makes it worth it is the driver of the Pittsburgh/Bay Point train who usually drives a train around 5:30 out of Powell, who likes to say twangy things like, ""We done filled this train up--let's go home."""
2,"Jan 20, 2009","I'm sorry but after that shooting incident with Bart police, it's pretty hard to feel safe riding Bart and having to worry if you'll accidentally end up a target because you ""look"" like a trouble maker or simply because of being at the wrong place at the wrong time.Overall, Bart does get you around faster then cars when there's traffic but due to having only a single track has quite a few delays and is always packed. I sometimes worry about riding it after viewing several You tube videos of weirdos jacking off next to other passengers and others starting fights and harassing passengers. It's dirty and too many riders have zero respect for keeping it clean for all of us to enjoy. And the security and workers hardly ever enforce the rules or go after those who litter or the mental nut bags, instead they like to shoot youngsters and take the law into their own hands. Bart, I know I sometimes have to rely on you to get me into the city and to work, school, interviews etc..and although you're a bit cheaper than taking the Bay link Ferry, I think I'd rather pay more to feel more secure and know I'll be getting to my destination on time and in one piece. The DC metro is far more efficient and reliable not to mention cleaner than Bart, unfortunately."
4,"Feb 23, 2009","Coming from a city not all that big on public transportation - San Diego, CA - I truly appreciate a well-run system that can get you to the important places in the city and beyond - Thanks!Getting from SFO to the city is incredibly easy, safe, and inexpensive.  I'd guess it takes about the same amount of time (30"") as taking an expensive cab, and definitely less time than renting your own car (not to mention the annoyance, expense and time to park once you get there).Your BART card doesn't expire, so hold on to it, grab a machine the next time you're at a station, and just add more money to it if need be.  SO EASY!$1.50 gets you from Union Square to Mission and less than $5 gets you from SFO Airport to the city.And the website is helpful, information and user-friendly.Again, thanks!"
3,"Jul 12, 2006","I thought that I had already written a review for you BART.  I was only coming back to lower my rating...So, I have been riding BART for the last year just about everyday of the work week.  And until May it has been great.  I enjoyed getting on the train and heading out to my gig in Emeryville every morning.  Nice to have a 26 minute warm-up for work every morning, listening to the iPod, reading and trying to keep my bike out of everyones way.  I laughed as I saw gas prices rising, knowing that I drive now about 150 miles a month!  Ha! Gas means nothing to me sucka!No. TLR, Not so fast.....Yesterday marked the 4th major delay on BART in the last 30 days.  This time I was 50 minutes late.  Now, I leave a cushion... but holy crap!  That is just about an hour stuck in a tube?!  With little knowledge of when I would be let free.  We just had a rate increase too. What give BART?  Are the oil companies leaning on you to provide a shitty service?  Let me know I'll go flex on Chaney and maybe we can get them off your back.Please, get better, you are making my gloating ass look bad."
3,"Sep 6, 2006","It's so great that we have a functional subway here in the bay area. I live 2 blocks away from North Berkeley Bart and use it all the time. Having said that there are some serious problems I find. 1) Expense: Why oh why do I have to pay $10 for a round trip to the city? Between gas & toll carpooling quickly makes more sense which makes Al Gore sad. 2) Downtown SF only!?!?!? Oh I dearly wish there was a line out to the Richmond. Someone told me that there is some earthquake safety problem but of that I'm not sure.  3) Wacky Bartcard: Almost all other public transportation systems in the world use a flat rate. A $1.50 to get into the system and free to get out. This can be quite a hassle if you have to get a bunch of people into the train since each of them needs their own damn card. When they are tourists in turns into a fiasco .... ok so you say that the further you go the more you should pay? Why, then, is the minimum charge $1.40? If I only travel one stop it should be proportionate as well ... where is my $.50 bart stop? 4) Bus transfers : Ok so this is arguably a fault of the bus systems but i'm going to complain here anyway. You leave a bart station, grab a handy bus transfer and viola you can get to the Richmond (after 45 minutes of battling traffic and 10 zillion stops). Then it's time to come back ... if you don't make sure to bring exact change with you watch out ... you are going to get some nasty stares. I really wish that all bay area public transportation systems used the same magnetic cards. Then transfers could be calculated automatically. 5) San Mateo and Santa Clara county voters : IDIOTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 6) Train notification signs : when they aren't blank or telling you about some stupid safety precaution or advertising they occasionally tell you when the next train is coming and how big it is. Why they can't simply have that up there and post permanent signs for the other BS is well beyond me."
4,"Sep 11, 2008","BART, you smell funny, the stations are eerie, your chairs are kind of gross and your conductor hit on me at a very unreasonable hour in the morning. But you sure worked out getting me to and from the airport while I was on my little vacation, so I'm grateful. And a teensy bit creeped out.p.s. You might visit Chicago to experience the wonder of tube advertising. Just so I have something else to experience besides spending the whole ride wondering if there are ghosts lingering underground."

4,"Aug 26, 2010","I like the BART.  It brings back very fond memories of time before I was legal to drive. It empowered me to get tons of places around the Bay Area all by myself.  I use to take my little brother on excursion rides when I was stuck babysitting him.And now that I can (and do) drive, I appreciate it those nights I don't wanna cuz I want to drink too much. Mahalo, BART."
3,"May 19, 2011","Want dirty nasty seats and carpet that might give you MRSA? Ride BART! 3 stars cause the train gets me out of my car and I can thankfully, thus, avoid the bus."
5,"Oct 8, 2006","I love BART!It is convient, fast, and on time.  It takes me between Oakland and SF under the bay in no time.  Rather than driving in traffic, I can relax and read or listen to music.  But it does get really noisy when in deep tunnels.Bay area is very lucky to have this form of public transportation.  No other city in America (besides NYC) has this luxery.  It gets lots of people around very quickly, catering to all people.  Fares can be a little pricy and it would be better if they had a better bulk rate discount or monthy pass.  The employees are very friendly.I love the people watching and the music played in the halls."
4,"Jun 20, 2011","Have you ever taken a bus in Houston? Make sure to plan on at least an hour if you want to travel more than two miles. Oh, and a normal 30-minute drive? Two hours. Coming from outside the loop and want to get anywhere on a Sunday? Forget it. My point? People need to cut the BART some slack. Sure, there are things that can be improved upon, but most of the issues like crazies and unwanted smells are typical of public transportation anywhere. I love that you can get anywhere in the Bay Area on the train, and the ride is relatively painless, as anyone who's ever driven in this town will tell you. I'm always on time to work, and get to read and write and listen to music on the way. Score. The Verdict: It's public transportation. It's not perfect, and I of course, wish it were cheaper. But all the haters out there are a bunch of whiners. For real."
4,"Apr 18, 2007","One star is missing people, and I'm guessing you East Bay folks know what that represents; the thing SHUTS DOWN right when you need it! Too bad for you, little drunky that got kicked off the stoop while trying various deal-closing lines to be invited into your new friends bedroom. Now you've got to walk your ass to the Transbay bus and try to flag it down while its going like 65 in the middle of the night.    In the daytime though, its clean and on time which is a miracle to anyone who ever lived in NYC(not dissin my subway people-they're smart enough not to carpet the cars).   I was under the Transbay Tube (between Embarcadero station and West Oakland) when an earthquake hit and I didn't burn or drown, so BART rules!"
3,"Aug 14, 2008","BART is the easiest and best mass transit system to use to get all around the different parts of the Bay Area with perhaps Amtrak coming in a distant second.  I used BART for several years for my daily commute from the East Bay (San Leandro) to the Financial District (Montgomery St), which only took 30 minutes door-to-door (assuming there were no delays). And only costs $11 roundtrip (includes $1/day parking for Fremont station)Yes, I'm aware the system has its occasional hiccups and outages, but no system is perfect.  During my rides on BART, I can simply take a power-nap to refresh myself before I reach my destination (whether it's my office, car, or the Oakland Arena to watch a Warriors game - Yes, I'm aware that Baron Davis is now w/ the Clippers, but I was a loyal Warriors fan before he came to the Bay Area...they're still our local b-ball team...even if they do suck), read a book, do some work, or just catch up on my Wallstreet Journal or e-mails.  Today, I still can rely on BART to hope on the Fremont station, quickly coast down to downtown SF to do my holiday shopping without having to worry and fight against traffic or other people for parking.  The price of the tickets have increased and we now have to pay for parking, but I guess that's what's needed to keep this system going and improving.If/when they finally get rid of all the red tape and bureaucracy and extend BART down to San Jose and the rest of the South Bay, and effectively connect all three airports (SFO, Oakland, & San Jose Int'l), then I'll uprade my rating of the system to 5-stars."
4,"Aug 28, 2006","Ahhhh Bart...where do I even start. Well, first let me say I'm an extremely punctual person. I hate being late places. I usually strive to be places I need to be a half hour in advance. So obviously time is VERY important to me.The one thing that I really love about Bart is the time factor. You can pretty much rely on what the schedule clams will be the time Bart should be arriving next. I'm also an impatient person to some extent, so I like to have an idea of how long I have to wait. Bart seems to keep me posted pretty well. There are times where Bart can let me down, and that's the precise reason I didn't give it five stars. There are always improvements that can be made, but I'm satisfied thus far. Another thing to note about Bart is the convenience factor. I don't know how many times I've gone down into the station, and lone behold my Bart train is already there! I can clock getting downtown to about ten minuets or less... school about 20 minuets...now how awesome is that?  No matter how you look at it Bart is one of the better forms of mass transit around. Now I just wish boyfriends were as punctual as Bart..eh I won't hold my breath..."
5,"Dec 15, 2006","BART is like the greatest thing ever compared to most other US public transit systems (the one exception being Washington DC Metrorail).  I went to grad school in Boston, and holy shit, the Boston T is like an insult to humanity.  Here are BART's strengths and weaknesses in comparison to other major US transit systems (e.g., New York, Boston, etc):Pros:Fast (BART's *lowest* typical speed - 36 mph - is nearly as fast as the *fastest* speed of an NYC express train) +++Reliable (my experience is about 98% on time) +++Safe (0 fatal accidents in approximately 20 billion passenger miles) ++Cheap (people complain that it's more expensive than Boston, but per mile it's a lot cheaper) +Comfortable (rarely reaches true crush loads) +Clean Stations +Timed Transfers...OMG, these are the best things ever +Cons:Worse Coverage Area (but that's not really BART's fault - it's the geography of the area) --Infrequent Off-Peak Service -Trains Carpets Getting Funky -BART wins 12-4...that's enough for 5 stars in my book.Update - my favorite BART quote ever:""BART, which carries about 340,000 riders a day, meets schedule about 95 percent of the time. Management hopes to boost that to 96 percent.""Yeah, that's what we like to hear - a little bit of the Japanese railway timekeeping mentality going on there.  I hate it when a transit system lets itself slide.(from http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/06/13/MNGRUQEFN81.DTL&hw=bart+west+oakland+paramedic&sn=001≻=1000 )"
3,"Dec 21, 2007","We love it, we hate it, we love to hate it.I  admit that I would miss BART if it went away all of a sudden.  I've become too accustomed to getting myself around the Bay Area without a car, and I know the superior AC Transit Transbay and CalTrain services can't always take me to where I'm going, especially on weekends.That said, there are so many obvious ways BART could've been better from the start.  There are well-designed public transit  systems all over the world which the BART planners could have emulated...but did not.  For instance, none of the BART planners seemed to think providing express service was important.  Yes, every BART train stops. At. Every. Single. Station. On. The. Route.  The BART planners were clearly not contemplating taking that hour-plus ride from the East Bay to the Peninsula themselves!  No, indeed, spending all that time on a BART train is only for chumps.   If there are free seats, they might be too dirty to sit in.  If you're a bicyclist, other passengers might give you a hard time even if you're following BART's stringent rules about when and where you may place your bike.  If you're hungry or thirsty, forget it!  Put some calories in your mouth, and you could be cited by a BART cop.All these years of using BART have made me seriously consider getting a car."
2,"Aug 23, 2005","Come on.  Even the New York City subway has a monthly pass available for sixty bucks, and it goes EVERYWHERE.  Including a transfer to surface buses. Get it together, BART."
2,"Aug 9, 2006","Damn It BART!!!!!!!I'd strangle it, if I could.I hate the way you only send a five car train during peak morning commute from the Millbrae station - WTF!?! It is completely full by the 3rd stop and people are usually standing on top of each other.And what about the cars that blow hot air through the air conditioning? Surely something can be done to correct that situation in the middle of summer. I want to get all those highly-paid BART executives to ride through the system on those cars all day....and why not throw in some of the frequent stench and mess left behind by other passengers that never seems to disappear? YELPERS...ARE YOU WITH ME?For the price, I think riders should demand better."

3,"Nov 13, 2007","Traveling from the South Bay to the City...Commuting from San Jose to San Francisco five days a week is not for everyone.  It requires mad skill.  Different modes of transportation should be used on different days, depending on what you have going on in any given situation.  Picking one's mode of transportation from the South Bay to San Francisco is much like choosing which wine to have with your food.   It takes finesse.  Experience.  Taste.  Ones choices are:  1) Fremont BART; 2) Caltrain; or 3) Driving.If one chooses the mode of transportation wisely, one can make it from San Jose to the financial district in San Francisco in an effortless hour to hour and a half.  Effortless, because your time will be spent catching up on a favorite novel, reading the newspaper, or calling a friend you haven't spoken to in ages.if you do not choose wisely, you will be stranded in a quagmire of public transportation or gridlock hell.  There will be no parking spot at BART or Caltrain.  BART or Caltrain will be delayed.  You will miss the express service and it will take 2 hours to creep into the City.  And then, once you get to the City, MUNI will not show up.  Or, you will spend two hours in your car inching up the 101.So when should you take Fremont BART to the City?  In one, and only one situation.  When you are both leaving the South Bay and the City either extremely early or extremely late.  Mix and match as you please -- it will give you 4 combos (early-early; early-late; late-early; late-late).  But you can never, ever, plan on leaving either the South Bay or the City at a normal time.  This is very similar to the rule that you should not feed gremlins after midnight. You may take BART if you need to get into the City very early (leaving Fremont no later than 7am).  Why?  If you don't leave Fremont obscenely early, you will not find a parking spot at BART.  Or, leave Fremont late, by 10am -- more parking spots open at that time.  Conversely, leave the City early -- no later than 2pm.  If you leave between 3-7, you will be stranded on the parking lot, aka the 880 South.  Thus, BART is also a fine choice if you are having a late dinner in the City, and want to leave from 7 - 9 pm.BART gets three stars, because it is generally reliable.  Minus two stars for its significant limitations."
4,"Aug 5, 2008","Living in Orange County I can appreciate any form of public transportation that actually works.  I've only ever ridden the BART from Oakland Colesium to the 16th and Mission Station and back when visiting SF.  But each time I have gotten a train quickly, I've always gotten a seat, it has been relatively clean, and I go to where I wanted to go in a reasonable amount of time for a decent amount of money.The only problem I have is the lack of a decent audio system or a sign board announcing the next stop.  Not being familiar with SF and the BART stops I always make it a point to count the number of stops before getting on the train so I know when mine is approaching since I can't rely on being able to understand the garbled gibberish coming out of the crappy speakers."

If the train is full he will apologize for a ""sardine commute"" and let the passengers know if there is another SF train close behind us.  And arrived at 8:44 , seven min. Late.  I have been riding bart every weekday for about a year and a half now.  I normally take 2 or 3 trains earlier than I should need to in order to be at work on time.  Why?  Well, the answer is the reason for this review blog.  I would like to document the frequency and length of the  bart delays at least the ones I experience.  Please join me if you are as disappointed  and frustrated as I am.  To step on my soap box for a moment, I will say that it is not just the delays that are motivating this exercise.   I either can't hear what the driver/announcer is saying or I am getting my eardrum blasted!  The volume of the speakers is an issue.  About a third of time, and this is only based on my experience, so chime in if you disagree,  the train is a SAUNA!!  Especially when the train is sitting in the tube or some other place where the doors cannot be opened.  Back to the delays, medical emergencies cannot be helped for the most part,  but the reason for the holding of the train is what exactly?   Track maintenance during the commute hours??  The results of delays are not just the obvious issues with attendance wherever one is traveling, but also crowded trains.  When a train is delayed, more people get on at each proceeding stop.   Lack of personal space aside, tensions as well as temperatures rise.  It makes for a very stressful and potentially unsafe(?) start and or end to one's day.  Now I don't know if BART ever promised a pleasant ride, but somehow I would think that some basic safety questions would at least arise but hopefully be addressed.  How many people is safe to travel in each car?  Is it safe to hold trains at the end of Warriors games, or the last train of the night and send BART reps to the platforms to pack people like sardines (and I mean to the point of not being able to move any part of one's body) and send them on their way??  Is trained staff on board to address medical issues that arise from this stuff?  Yes the solutions to my concerns have a hefty price tag, but the price of not addressing them might just be greater.  I'm not just talking about personal comfort and individual passenger health, which sadly hasnt been enough to motivate a change, I'm talking about larger scale effects on the economy.  Where could we be if more people could just have a reliable and safe commute to work not to mention the rest of this beautiful Bay Area?  Ok, off the soapbox.  What are your thoughts?BART, my request to you,  since you increased our fares at least once since I became a rider promising improvements, please deliver.   It's great that threw are new cars and seat covers,  but what I care about is reliability.   Thank you.   Day one:  2/6/15 : took the Daly City train that should arrive at embarcadero at 8:44.  I am currently leaving as I type, West Oakland station and it is 8:50.    We arrived at embarcadero  at 8:57.  Now, on the ride home, we are holding as we are backed up behind a ""couple of trains""... at 5 :51"

5,"Apr 18, 2007","BART is tha shiznit! You get cellphone service all over the city (which can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on WHO you are sitting next to!)  Its fast as hell and gets you where you need to be without all that traffic mess. In fact I took BART to the Golden State Warriors game the other night  with my homeskillet and I was amazed at how quickly I got there! In addition to the great ride on the way home, BART offered a little ""contact high"" from some peeps on our train who clearly didn't mind the cameras and sparked a doobie in our car  while saying ""We from Richmond, we ain't corporate!""  NICE!!!!!! I love you BART!"
4,"Sep 2, 2007","Bart is awesome!, the ride is pretty smooth and convenient as well, the only downside is that there are stupid people who talk loud and are inconsiderate of others, and annoy everyone on the train with their stories on life that nobody really cares about.  The fare from fremont to sf is 10 dollars though, a bit high but better than driving through all that traffic, plus it's nice to get a little nap along the way :) save up energy to wait for your gf while she shops the day away in sf."
5,"Sep 6, 2007","Hurray for BART.  My only complaint is that the tracks don't come all the way to the San Joaquin Valley.  But close.  I can leave my car in Pleasanton and catch the train into the city for a week of being car-free.  I can go to Berkeley and catch the train to Oakland or to SF.  When I'm in the south bay I can park at Millbrae and go anywhere from there.  That's where the Cal Train station connects to BART too.  Although I don't mind driving 580 or 101, I don't want to drive in SF, so this is THE way to go."

3,"Mar 20, 2009","Twinkle Twinkle little star I can only barely give you 3...After yes dare I say riding the NYC subway, or even the MAXX in Portland...you are way over priced for one ride. And not to be able to get an all day pass for a set price...shame on you. Make yourself rider friendly. Yes many people use you for commuting and trips into the city for entertainment like concerts and dining, but miss the last train before midnight and you are screwed. It's so annoying getting out of the Warfield and making sure you get to BART before the last train. Or if you leave Oakland Coliseum and you need to transfer, do it early enough or you'll miss it! ugh! What's the point? You just might as well turn into a pumpkin.....The NYC subway isn't the cleanest and yeah it's pretty crowded at commute times but it's so easy to get around the city. And it's CHEAP! (and many times entertaining in it's self). The MAXX in Portland is CHEAP and gets you from Beaverton to Gresham through Portland, into the Airport (so easy!) So BART listen up, get with the program and make some fun day passes or run later on weekends, REALLY.... think about it."
4,"Dec 24, 2009","While in SF I've taken the BART to get from SFO to a hotel in downtown and go to Oakland. For what it is, a commuter subway, I think it's the right pill for the area. Knowing that you use it to basically go to other cities around the Bay it's great. It would be nice if it was flat rate like NYC, Chicago, and LA subway and train systems, but you can't have everything. I found BART to be among the cleanest systems that I've rode and I felt quite safe riding to just about every station even after coming just after that BART cop shot/killed that guy in Oakland. I come away with a good regard for BART."
4,"Mar 1, 2011",BART is a great way to get around the Bay Area. I just wish it went to Bentwood and also San Jose State. This would really bring up the land value in Brentwood and also would  make it much easier for people to commute from San Jose to San Francisco and vise versa.

2,"Dec 24, 2006","What I like:- It's better for the environment than driving.-Comfy cars.- The little markers at the station platforms that tell you where the doors will end up. - Easy transfer to Caltrain at the Millbrae station.What I don't like:-The trains just don't come frequently enough. - They really need to expand it to other parts of the city and bay area.-Cars are smelly, like moldy carpet. -Unless you get a fast pass, the BART tickets aren't compatible with the SF Muni system.  They should do more to integrate the different transit systems around the Bay Area so you can just use the same card (E.g. in NYC, the same farecard lets you on either the subway or the bus.).- The BART tickets are so easily demagnetized! If you put it too close to your ipod, the magnetic clasp on your purse, your building entry smart card -- anything will demagnetize it!  So annoying."
4,"Aug 28, 2007","I had never really dealt with public transportation until I moved out here from Sactown. BART totally intimidated me at first with it's big shiny complicated ticket machine but over the past 3 years I have grown fond of good 'ol stinky BART.I have the same gripes as everyone else: it's loud, smelly, contains crazy people, funky seats, expensive, stupid tiny value tickets you can never spend, DOESN'T RUN LATE ENOUGH, etc.I'm taking it once a week to go to school at SF State (Market street) and it is SO convenient to just zip to Millbrae (ok, not exactly zip, who zips on 101 at 4 in the afternoon?!) hop on BART and chill with the ipod until Powell. I don't even have to go outside!It cracks me up that the little schedule at the Millbrae Station has ""Union Square"" penciled in next to Powell Street, I guess a lot of people had questions on how to get to Union Square.Also, huge plus that BART can take me to Little Star in the Mission and eliminate the headache of parking. Extra star for that ;)"
3,"Apr 20, 2011","I've ridden public transit in Washington, DC, Boston, NYC, Philly, Houston, Amsterdam, Paris, Barcelona, and London.  How does the BART measure up?  Decently.  There will probably not be a service representative to answer any questions.  If there are, they will be deep in conversation and ignore you until you interrupt them.    There are kiosks with which you can use cash or credit/debit to purchase tickets.  You have to figure out your destination to figure out how much cash to put on the ticket.  There is no way to input how much to put on your card, just start with where the machine allows you and then you have to use the up/down arrows to add/subtract dollars and cents to your ticket.  Annoying.  You will have to swipe in at your entry point and exit point.  The platforms have electronic signs that do tell you when the next train is arriving, pretty accurately.  It's expensive compared to all of the other cities in which I've ridden public transportation.  In Boston, I can get from the airport to anywhere on the MBTA $2 ($1.75 with a Charlie Card).  A friend took the bus In Houston from the international airport to downtown for $1."

4,"Apr 29, 2006","I'm in love with public transit to begin with....It's the greatest concept to me EVER.I live in Michigan which, compared to SF in terms of landscape, is like comparing a 15 year old gymnast to pamela anderson.      driving/parking/navigating big ass hills in a myriad of traffic is less than cool.  So what's a girl to do (besides hoof it?)Get your fanny a BART pass and c'mon ride that train...It's clean, fairly timely, but it is a little costly in terms of most public transit systems....but hell, gas is $3/gallon now, so whatever.And by the way, BART to SFO definitely rox my sox..."
2,"Jan 23, 2007","I love public transportation, but please somebody help the public transit people of SF and East Bay.1) The seating fabric choice is soooooo regrettable.  Vinyl that can be wiped down.  Same thing for the carpeting; get rid of it.2) Is it so hard to provide the right amount of additional trains at rush hour times?3) If you want to encourage people to ride BART on a commuter basis, provide monthly incentives; i.e. better prices for commuters.4) People like to get around on the weekends as well as the weekdays, particularly weekend nights.  5) Why are the escalators always going up when I need to go down and down when I am going up?"
4,"Aug 26, 2007","BART is my favourite public transit in the US.There really is no point in having a car in San Francisco, cabs are too expensive and sometimes you just don't feel like walking five miles.I mean you can get to the goddamn airport, BART is amazing and on time!Unlike the NYC subway, it's easy to understand the lines and how to get to your destination."
4,"Apr 9, 2009","BART has hardly ever failed me in regards to its punctuality...maybe once or twice while heading to SFO but it still gets me there on time and that's all that matters!It's quick, efficient, and definitely gets me to work on time everyday. I hate how it gets super packed during rush hours (close to 9am and 6:30-7pm) though, but I deal with it since I'm on the train for less than 10 min anyways. It's totally worth it if you live in SF because $45 for a monthly MUNI fast pass will let you take BART unlimited within the city.The price can add up if you commute from the East Bay but I think BART is an excellent public transportation system! The gripes I have about the trains (esp the ones with carpet) is that it can get smelly/damp on rainy days and the seats can have questionable stains. At least it's not as rickety and noisy as the NYC subway.Overall, BART is awesome and I'm all about reducing my carbon footrprint!"
5,"Jul 30, 2009","DAMMIT! I really miss BART.And, I hate driving here in the LA/OC area.Yeah, some of the cars AC is crapped out, and that can be literally HELL when commuter-hours and the car is packed with passengers.And yes, some of the cars smell like piss, and if the AC is crapped out and you're traveling during the commuter-hours, then yes...it's miserable.Let's not forget about the strange and homeless that somehow get on a train and panhandles.Or the insanity of concert goers, A's or Giants baseball fans, Raiders or CAL Bear football fans and what ever other events that happen anywhere in the Bay.But, for everyday travel and those times when you know you're gonna be inebriated, BART ROCKS.Seriously LA/OC area, you need to get with the program.The public transit system is damn near non-existent. Yeah, it's may cost a bagiliion dollars to make happen, but people WILL use it. And it WILL create thousands of new jobs.Accident rate and drunk driving will be down. I WILL ease traffic congestion.

4,"Oct 1, 2010","Anything's better than SEPTA.I hardly ever took BART when I lived in California and would take it a few times while visiting and have never had a bad experience while riding.  Chances are when I find myself back in the Bay Area I will be using it quite frequently, unless of course, I buckle down and learn how to drive ;)"
2,"Jul 31, 2017","Good for those who work 9-5 and commute to/from the city because while the trains are full, at least the station agents will be present, and the riders will be quality people. If you work off-hours like I do, it's a different story. Riding during the day isn't too bad, except for the panhandlers (sometimes aggressive) walking the trains and the general semi-foul smell that BART always seems to have. If you're riding at night, however, you best be on your guard. In the past two weeks of riding (I come home from working weeknights close to midnight) I've seen: 1) a loud argument between two homeless people in the 12th street station result in one of them violently kicking the train 2) a fight on a train over a hat 3) a guy stripping naked in the Montgomery station 4) someone smoking crack on the train. This was pretty much the last straw for me, so I usually commute via car or the bus now. Basically, if you plan to ride after 9 PM, prepare for some crazy stuff to go down. Also, there's been at least two incidents where teenagers have stormed the train at Coliseum station looking to rob people, so keep that in mind as well."
3,"Dec 19, 2008","Please please please run more cars on Richmond lines! Transferring from a 10 car to a 3 car is insane. I wish BART ran later than 12:30am in order to avoid being stuck in the city. Riding BART on Sundays is the worst :( They could clean the cars more and do more upkeep on maintenance. I hate going into those warm, sweaty, and smelly cars! I am looking forward to the new BART."
3,"Feb 9, 2016","They desperately need to add more trains and cars on the Pittsburg/Bay point line. It took me to the 3rd train to finally board. In addition, it's wall to wall standing. Almost as bad as Asia."
3,"Nov 11, 2005","Sometimes I BART back over to the EB, sometimes I take AC Tranist.Ways BART is better that ACT: - quicker to where the Honey picks me up. - shorter walk to Bart form the office - you can buy BART tickets everywhere.- people can't use thier cell phones in the tunnel (yet...)BART sucks compared to ACT:- you feel dirty after taking BART - some of those cars are old.- just try getting a seat after 4:45pm.- annoying tourists take BART- It makes me lazy.- when it rains it gets really nasty humid in the cars."
3,"Jan 17, 2007","BART really should be rename to SFEBRT (SF-East Bay Rapid Transit) as it really doesn't service the the South Bay. BART really should focus on providing: [1] transit operation to three and 1/2 of the largest employment centers (SF, East Bay, San Jose, South Bay) [2] better transit connectivity with other public transit (bus, cabs, Amtrak, etc.) {the SF Transit Terminal being propose will solve this issue} [3] more mix-use developments around stations similar to ones found in Asia and [4] run several lines 24/7 especially on Friday & Saturday; its ridiculous that this metropolis doesn't run trains all night while Chicago and New York does.Beside those 4 solvable issues, BART is a great mass transit system. It's convenient, reliable, and cost effective to get around the SF-East Bay."
3,"Jul 15, 2007","First off, they have to regularly clean certain areas on BART trains that smell like urine.  I don't take showers in the morning just to undo it with a fresh scent of human pee on the way to school/work.BART is typically efficient with their times, but I'm not into the idea of charging 2 dollars a day at certain BART parking lots such as the one in Daly City.  Yeah, I know you can get a monthly pass but still, they already did with the hikes in prices.  What gives?"
3,"Aug 17, 2007","Okay, so I'm glad BART exists for when I don't feel like getting my butt numb from riding Caltrain to San Francisco. The ride is definitely much smoother, but that's all it has going for it.The ride is relatively expensive for the places you go to. The stations are inconvenient to get to and pretty spread out. The system closes at midnight for some reason, which doesn't make sense on the weekends. If you want people to stop driving while they're intoxicated, have the public transportation system (BART especially) open longer to accomodate the crowds during late-night weekends. DC's Metro system and NYC's subways already do, which is why those subways are definitely much better than BART.I can't wait for BART to get to the South Bay...whenever it does. At least then it will be a little more convenient to ride it instead of having to drive to Fremont. It kinda defeats the purpose of taking public transportation in my books."
3,"Sep 3, 2007","Close to on time, gets me to East Bay when I need to go, and certainly is moving in the right direction by removing the carpet in place of a much easier to clean, sanitary floor.

4,"Nov 1, 2007","Sometimes it smells, but it is mostly on time, and what is the alternative?One day I hope it will go all the way around the bay, is that asking too much?"
5,"Jan 9, 2008","It was hard...  4 or 5 stars...  It's safe, clean, lot's of buses stop there, plenty of parking and you're completely protected from Mother Nature while waiting for BART.  Excellent design.  But, with the additions of some places to eat close by, that pushed it over the top!  Now, there's a Starbucks close-by and some other places opening soon."

4,"Jul 23, 2008","I admit, I was anti-public transportation for a LOOOOONG time.  HOWEVER, I am also fiercely anti-paying for parking.  This presents a dilemma, primarily on high-traffic weekends, such as the one prior to Christmas, and the recent 4th of July.  Instead of driving downtown, I decided to take BART, from Balboa Park, near my house.  Holy hell, it didn't take very long, wasn't a very long walk from my house, and didn't smell bad either.  Perhaps I'll be taking BART more often.  BART, you've restored my faith in Public Transit.  p.s.  You will still never see me on the Dirty Eight Geary, though, no way in hell.  *shudder*"
3,"Nov 1, 2008","A few things BART could do to be kick-ass:- Install that glass barrier thing like they have for the SFO AirTrain.  I was on the train when some dude leapt onto the tracks at Civic Center and held up the entire system for hours.  Thank god for Muni, but, having some sort of barrier between the passengers would keep bodies off the track, keep other sorts of debris off the track, and stop that wind tunnel effect when trains come roaring into the station (esp. at 24th and Mission)- Run earlier and have more frequent trains on the weekends.  Maybe it's just me and my early-bird ass, but it sucks having to wait until like 8:30 on a Sunday to catch the train down to Daly City.  At times I just took the J to Balboa Park and hopped on the 54 Felton bus to the Daly City Station instead of waiting for the station to open.  And I wasn't commuting to a weekend job either, but I know a lot of people do.  Having the option to take the train instead of the bus would be nice.- RUN LATER.  Remember when the trains ran all night that one time?  That was awesome.  Not only would I have to peace out of parties too early to make the last train, but it might help its budget problems if, you know, more people were riding the train.  I know I'm not the first person to suggest this, but they really need to consider it.  C'mon!All in all, it's doing a great job, but it could be excellent if it did these few things."
3,"Nov 7, 2008","I like how they announce which train is coming along with the estimated time of arrival (psst, take a note Caltrain!)I like how unlike the Caltrain doors between cars, the BART doors don't try to use you as a door stop.And I like how the majority of them are on time. Seriously, Caltrain, learn something!Things they can improve:Reupholster the seats. Do it. They're gross.Using something more than nothing to better sound-proof the cars. Because I've grown rather fond of hearing.Oh yeah, and unlike Caltrain, they can maintain over 60 miles of track."
4,"Jan 28, 2009","Pro's:*Very fast compared to Muni*Warm inside the trains*Comfy Seats (although I do suspect bed bugs in a few cars)*Accurate train arrival predictions*Escalators rarely down*Good for the environmentCon's*Expensive*LOUD in the trans-bay tunnel*Stations close when there are riots leaving you stranded in the. .well. .riot*No service to San Jose which really really really sucksI really endorse BART though and it is a LOT faster than driving over the bridge during rush hour traffic. I rarely have delays and since I am a reverse commute, I always get a seat."
3,"Mar 21, 2010","Now that I don't need to take BART to work, I have a better appreciation for it.Living in Oakland can sometimes put a damper in your social life, especially if all your friends are on the other side of the bay. But living 2 blocks away from a BART station changes that.On the weekends, I can walk to BART, and in 20 minutes be in the City. No traffic, no parking drama, no road rage.I know the daily drama of having to take BART to work makes most people hate it, but it's a great thing if you learn to appreciate it for what it is, rather than the crazy people who ride it."
1,"Sep 17, 2010","Granted, I'm the fool who tried to save a few bucks by flying into SFO instead of SJC. But $4 to travel from the airport to CalTrain (two stops, ladies and gentlemen) seems completely ridiculous. It was a mere $6 to get all the rest of the way to San Jose. Biggest annoyance: When paying with a credit card why is the default price $20? Seriously? Just ask people what they want to pay, rather than assuming the maximum then requiring the traveler to repeatedly press minus one, minus one, minus one until they get to their desired fare. Talk about a waste of time."
5,"Sep 24, 2015","For all its quirks, BART is a major asset to the SF Bay Area and a strong positive quality of life differentiator. I take it from the far suburbs to the City pretty much every day and to me that beats driving in our traffic jams in every way.  Of course, it helps that I live at the end of the line and can always get a good seat on my way to work so I can sleep or do something fun or productive.It is mostly functional as big delays are fairly rare (once or twice a month do I get hit by those). If one wants to live near a station, the choice of neighborhoods is great as the service area in the East Bay is large. The stations and trains are clean-ish and modern-ish (compared to Chicago or NYC). Clipper payment system is impeccable. Many stations do have large parking lots that always have room if you are there by 7:30. A lot of the tracks are elevated or at least are on the surface, affording a great view of the Bay Area. Most importantly, speed is unbeatable when roadways are congested.It is unfair to compare BART to transit in places like Northern Europe or East Asia. Sure, those are superior but for America, BART is just awesome. It is no secret that public transportation is just not a priority in this country so an apples to apples comparison is called for. In my experience, the only system in the US that compares to BART in both service area and cleanliness/modernity is the Washington Metro and even that comparison is a toss up. Folks like to bring up NYC as the ultimate transit success yet as functional as its subway is, a lot of it is unbelievably delapidated.I love my BART."
3,"Aug 15, 2006","-There needs to be more bart stations within the bay area. -Bart needs to be cleaned more regularly. (Hella Dirty)-There should be a flat fee for all day usage, instead of charging x amount from point A to point B, then point B to point C..etc-I agree with the reviewer who said Bart needs to implement a system like Fasttrack, it would make it easier for regular user to zip through.-What exactly do the bart booth people do? They get hella annoyed when you ask them a question. -Forget bart, make some bullet trains."
3,"Aug 24, 2006","BART, you scare the living daylights out of me.  Some of that fear is just random irrational claustrophobia, but I know it would be relieved a great deal if you would hurry up and do some earthquake retrofitting, especially for the tube and the tunnel between rockridge and orinda.On a lighter note, trains between 12AM and 5AM would be nice too.  Even just a few.These concerns aside, thanks BART for getting me to the city and to A's baseball games, both of which are a ninth circle of parking hell."

I'm no PhD in sociology or behavior science so I know what people want/need/act.  Bart is really hit or miss.  1)  When I was a kid... I would drive over to west embarcadero and bart into work at embarcadero center.  Great... took me within a block of where I needed to be, saved me $$ on parking and bridge fare.2)  Going to an A's game?  awesome.. there is stop right there.3)  I went up to a class in downtown oakland..

I still have to drive on one side to get to a station.... and most of the time, one of the stations, either the head or tail end, are in areas that are kinda sketchy, and I don't REALLY wanna spend time there, and there aren't any convenient/safe connectors on the other side.BART isn't especially cost effective...  doesn't run frequently enough for me to say ""wow... that was convenient,""  as an overall trip, because I have to drive to one end, isn't especially fast.... it's a chore and an effort to use mass transit like this.It fits the uses of some people... while not others... bummer!!  why is it that in the bay area... we have like 40 different bus lines, and half a dozen rail lines for public transit!!!  is it because our public works and government is just all suck arse that they can't get people to decide on stuff?  sheesh...  no wonder everyone is buying a hybrid!!!"
2,"Jul 11, 2008","Good points:- You'll get there. Eventually.- Better than nothing. Usually.- Only delayed sometimes.- The newer refurbished cars are much more pleasant to ride in. (although they still have to do something about those nasty old seats)- Gets you to the airports. (tho' AirBART is still a freaking joke)- Newer stations are fairly nice and more-or-less modern.- Recently, they actually seem to have gotten half a clue about making real-time train arrival and system status information available via the web and mobile devices.Bad points:- Trains and various station technology stuck in 1983 (I'm surprised they don't still have ticket machines that use Nixie tubes for their displays)- Train cars are filthy more often than not. Newspapers strewn hither and yon, half-full soda cans rolling around, chicken bones tossed on the floor, sunflower seed shells everywhere.- Air conditioning never works. (or am I mistaken about the trains even HAVING air conditioning?)- Mumbling train operator announcements... ""NESTOPIZZMSHSHSDHFPIUTHHSUTD, CHNGREFREDASFARPRTGHDDGGGFHD ANNASFDGSHGHGFUEDF""- Expensive (and rising) relative to other transit systems in the US and abroad, while reliability and rider experience is generally much poorer and, aside from minor improvements like the refurbished car interiors, seems to be declining.- Many stations are in very poor repair. Ugly 1970s earthtone color schemes only seem to accentuate the 35 years of grime oozing all over everything. Restrooms, if they're in service, are reminiscent of the 3rd world.- Useless after midnight.- Appears to be managed by cranio-anally impacted morons.- Rider information, maps, announcements, not always clear, sometimes needlessly misleading or confusing. Only took them 35 years to finally acknowledge in their printed materials the presence of, and ability to transfer to, other transit systems such as MUNI, Caltrain, Amtrak, etc. - Continually commits clueless and inept media and public relations gaffes, only furthering the the impression that the system is run by overpaid and out-of-touch boobs.- Infighting and lack of cooperation with other transit agencies appears to have contributed further to the already overdue and overbudget TransLink card rollout.- Tickets that get demagnetized if you look at them the wrong way, causing riders delays exiting the station, and frustration trying to get replacements issued. (Oddly, I've never had a BART ticket get screwed up on me outside of the system, it only happens to me after I've ridden a train and then try to exit. It's not like the contents of my pockets are any different in one place or the other. How do I know it's not the new RFID readers for the EZRider cards in the turnstiles jacking the things up?)- The fact that it's the only viable option some people have for getting certain places in anything under half a day.- Probably other snide comments I haven't thought of yet..."
2,"Jul 30, 2008","I still don't understand why people don't understand that there is a line to get on the Bart train.How many times have you been the first one in the line to have someone just all of sudden appear and rush in ahead of you.HOW RUDEOr when you are trying to get off,well people who really don't care that you are trying to exit they just pretend like they don't see you and move right on in and try to get a seat.I always let people get off first,as well as many other polite people that I have seen that get on ahead of me.Look, Bart is a fast commute to the downtown area,but the amount of assholes seems to escalate daily.Especially the individuals that block people who are trying to run down the escalator to catch a train.Move over to the RIGHT.Forgive me if this doesn't make sense,I am tired and wish it was Friday.Unfinished review update.."
2,"Oct 23, 2007","Bart has a few positive things that some may like.Spare the air day,parking at particular stations,finding tickets people drop in a seat,not driving to work and the quicker commutes.Ok,at times the quickier commute can be at times very slow and painful.My negatives:1.Delays2.People who act like the train in front of them is the last one.They end up getting stuck in the doors with a bag dangling.Delay us,you WILL not.Everyone proceeds to frown at the person.3.People who tend to talk loud.I mean VERY loud.After a night of suffering from a sleep deprived state I was on BART at 5:30am  and proceeded to get comfy(not really,I did try)regardless.Next station 2 people get on and sit in front of me.Started talking really loud.Mind you it was like 5:30am.WTF,I was in shock and honestly people were looking at them like can you please shut up already.Simply amazing.I would talk about more,but I am sure you know about it if you have taken Bart.Not bad for a fast commute.Prices and passengers vary.."
4,"Aug 13, 2008","This last weekend was my first time on the BART from SFO, and I really couldn't have been more impressed at how easy it was to get to the city!  Trains depart every 15 min or so and the cost of a one way trip is $5.35.  I took the train to the Powell St station, which incredibly just happened to be located within 3 blocks of my hotel!  The BART is also a great way to get to the Oakland airport or Berkeley.  Just beware, depending on where you're going, you might have to take the muni or a bus as a connection, so in that sense the coverage is a bit limited.  All in all, the trains are clean and comfortable, a super nice ride no doubt!"
3,"Aug 21, 2008","I was really close to giving BART 2 starts, but I'll settle on 3.  BART is necessary in my life-I need it to get to work and to take me to Cal Football games...so in the fall I am pretty much on it six days a week, twice a day.  However, just because I frequent BART does not mean I don't notice it's faults.  It's smelly.  Sometimes really, really smelly.  The seats are seriously FILTHY.  The paper tickets get demagnetized really easily (I am looking forward to the BART EZ Rider ticket I just ordered).  It is incredibly loud going from SF to Oakland.  Like, ipod on full blast and I still can't tell what I'm listening to!  Can't they do something about that??  It gets so painfully crowded at rush hour, they can't add a few more trains?  I could go on.  Pretty much, I only take BART out of necessity and the fact that I would feel guilty driving to work everyday.  I think it would do the BART system a lot of good to give it a little facelift, a little cleaning up."
4,"Aug 24, 2008","You know what, I don't live in San Francisco. I was only there to visit friends in SF and Berkeley, and to attend Outside Lands Music Festival. I can see that there are problems with BART (the ride from SF to Berkeley is so damn LOUD).Why am I giving it 4 stars? I was only in town for a few days, and I already pretty much understood the system and where to make transfers. The fact that it's on time, too, is rad."
4,"Nov 11, 2008","Things that DON'T suck:I've been riding BART for 10 years now, first as a college student, now as a person going to work. BART is pretty good, its on time about 99%. I have the credit card pass, very easy and you don't have to worry about it getting stuck inside the machine.  I find most station to have friendly people in the booths.  And, becoming less susceptible to colds.Things that DO suck:As of late, rush hours have been hard - I'm sure from gas prices/economy woes.  There's always a funky smell so maybe one day they will remove those seat covers.  And BART police don't patrol the cars as much as they should - too many wackjobs that smell like pee talking out loud to Jesus or something."
3,"Feb 2, 2009","So... it's better than having no public transportation around the bay area and it is definitely better than the muni...but that's not really saying much. Whoever thought it was a good idea to use fabric seats? Everytime I sit down, I think about the possible other people who have sat there after doing whatever it is that they do and i think that it's seeping into my clothes and skin....disgusting ... and unlike stainless steel or other kinds of metal, fabric can actually hold moisture and harbor bacteria... has the public health department been notified? i think it'd be interesting to see how much bacteria, fungi, and other stuff they can find on the bart seats. Why aren't the stations cleaner? Bathrooms?It's not like it already doesn't cost a ton of money for all of the bay area to ride bart. You'd think they'd have a little bit of surplus to do some remodeling or AT LEAST cleaning of the stations and bathrooms. Other things BART should do:-make changes to make it less noisy-make some sort of card/device to which you can add money OR a one time fee for monthly use. -run later (although multiple drunk people put together on a train doesn't seem to be the best idea at time, in addition to the fabric seats, which would probably now also contain vomit)-more security-workers with less attitudeother than that, bart is ok...but then again, that is almost like changing everything but the logo."
4,"May 9, 2009","BART is one of the better public transportation system in the Bay Area. It's fast, usually very prompt, and very predictable (they have a ""rotation"" system in place where if a Richmond train is here, you know what train is next). I usually take BART to and from downtown. Too bad it's not more extensive in the city, or else I would take it more often. The stations and trains are relatively clean, and the seats are mostly comfortable. But because the seats are clothed and cushioned, it does (and could) seem somewhat dirty. If the seats were metal, it would be easier to maintain, but of course it will not be as comfortable.For my usual BART route, BART does a nice job and I recommend it."
3,"Nov 30, 2009","Not a perfect system but alot better than HAVING to drive if one doesn't really want to.There, however, should be at least hourly trains for the late-nights instead of having to decide to take the last train  ( around 12:30AM'ish )  or wait till morning and take the first train the next day.Mostly on-time though a little cleaner carpet and seating would be nice  ( at least it's plusher than plastic )."
3,"May 3, 2010","After living in Bay area for several years, I finally did my first BART ride!  The ride was great, and impressed with their frequent trains!  The stops are convenience to a lot of places in the city.The ONLY thing is BART doesn't come to South Bay! I think I will stick with my Caltrain."
4,"Aug 17, 2012",BART gets 6 starts for customer service.  We bought round trip tickets for two but put them all on one ticket - oops - and the guy in the booth was SUPER helpful and friendly and fixed us up with a new ticket and gave us advice about where to go downtown.  We thought this niceness was a fluke until the guy on the other end (we needed to talk to him to use our new hand written ticket) on the way back out of the city was super friendly also.  BART gets knocked down a star because those cloth seats on the train are GROSS.  I don't know who has sat in them.  They are filthy.  I would prefer a hard plastic seat that is wiped down once in a while.
2,"Nov 3, 2016","BART exists - that's about it!  It must rank as the most inefficient metro rail system in any developed nation.  There seems to be no reason that doesn't end up delaying BART trains.  ""Equipment problem"", ""Police activity"", ""switching problem""... you name it... even ""weather conditions"" cause delays of 10, 15, 20 minutes!!  What BS!  Traveling opposite to the rush commute, the trains are already 15 to 20 minutes apart!  BART is not cheap either!  Having lived in cities around the world with highly efficient public transportation systems, I've been trying to take BART as much as I can, to support public transportation, but, after 3 years I'm about to give up on BART!"
2,"Mar 28, 2006","My first problem with bart is those nasty upholstered seats. OK, maybe plastic is uncomfortable, but those things reek of mold and are undoubtedly holding cells for lice, spores and other nasty sh*t. When do you think the last time those were cleaned was? Yeah, try never. And the noise. The shrieking, terrible noise. If you plan on zoning out and relaxing on your trip, think again. Think about nails on a chalkboard. Lots and lots of nails. Has anyone every heard of WD-40?The metallic voice doing the announcements freaks me out and makes me feel like I'm in a sci fi book where the future is bleak and soul-crushing. Did I miss anything? Yes, it is as confusing as f*ck."
3,"Oct 9, 2006","Things that suck about BART:They're very careful to make it impossible to see the signs saying when the next train will arrive until AFTER you've swiped your ticket.  Meaning, you're on the hook for $3+ if you decide you could get there faster via some other means.You can't take a bunch of old tickets, stick them in a ticket dispenser machine, and have it spit out a ticket for the combined amount.  Nor can you use old tickets to add value to a new one.  No, to get value out of old tickets, you have to visit BART's service counter at select locations (e.g., Powell St. station) at hours of their convenience.It's loud.  So loud that you can't even listen to an iPod on the thing, without cranking it up to damaging levels.  BART's howl is anything but relaxing.On the plus side, it finally goes to both airports!"
3,"Jul 26, 2007","I use BART once in awhile, to go to San Francisco or the A's games or to SFO airport, which I find really convenient. However, I am not a big fan of BART for several reasons. One is the fact that the trains are so crowded during rush hours or during an event like a ballgame. There are not enough handrails to hold onto, especially if you are short like me.I once rode to SF during December when one of the routes was closed down. The train kept stopping and loading on passengers until I couldn't even raise my arms because we were packed so tightly. Whenever the train started or stopped everybody tried to stay upright, which was not easy if you had nothing to hold onto.I recently traveled to Scotland, where I rode trains and buses for two weeks. Although some of the older city buses were a bit dingy looking, I would say in general their public transportation system is much cleaner and comfortable than BART. They also allow food on the trains, and even sell food and drinks in most of the larger stations. When we returned home from Scotland I noticed how dirty and worn BART looked in comparison with Scottish trains.Another annoying fact about BART is the unavailability of restrooms at most of its stations. When the stations were first built, they had one single restroom for men and women, which was inadequate to serve the quantity of riders on busy routes. Since then the restrooms have been closed (I just checked BART's website and it states that the street level restrooms are open but those underground are closed). In the UK train and bus stations have restrooms with several stalls, all open when we were last there in May 2007. You sometimes have to pay (currently 20 pence) to use them at larger stations such as Glasgow and Edinburgh, but at least they are there when you need them."
4,"Sep 3, 2007","I will never understand why people who board the BART trains in the downtown SF area after 5pm on weekdays insist on forming lines to get on the train. First of all, the lines generally block the passageway for people trying to get off the trains which kind of defeats the purpose of having a line in the first place. Second, people like me just step to the side, wait for the people to come off the train and still manage to board the train before the people who insisted on forming a line get on. Organized chaos perhaps?In New York, there are no lines when it comes to the subway system. Either you push your way to make the train or you get stuck having to wait for the next one. Granted this isn't New York and I haven't had to experience any ""pushy"" BART riders, but people come on. Forming a single-file line is so grade school. Thank god for my monthly MUNI fast pass that allows me to afford to ride BART at all in the San Francisco area. BART is a bit pricey.Recommendation: Feel the seat first before sitting on it. Nothing says a shitty day then sitting on a damp BART seat. Especially if it is the first thing in the morning, on your way to work"
3,"Aug 20, 2008","WOW... I haven't taken BART in a couple of years, but yesterday I took BART from millbrae to powell and it is seriously the loudest public transportation system I have ever been on! I couldn't even listen to my ipod because it was so damn loud!The seats are pretty dirty too... YUCK! But other than that, BART isn't that bad... I still think I'd rather drive..."
2,"Jan 9, 2009","I have only rode a bart train one time, but I know some things becuase I've been working inside the Bart system for a contractor. My ride went easy and smooth! Bart is the prime exsample of a union wizzing money away. The reason they can't run trains at night is the fact that the train operators make more on overtime pay than the revenue will support. I am a union worker as well, and work very hard for my employer. Without my employer I have no job. So why would I milk it dry? Bart workers are a very strong union, with very weak abilities to produce what they are paid. They wizz money away left and right paying higher ranked officials to take a week worth of paperwork just to decide if the Snickers wrapper on the ground is safe to pick up.  Union YesBart Union NO"
4,"Jun 9, 2009","I have a true love//hate relationship with BART.  I love the convenience, you want to go to the city and get your drank on and need a designated driver?  This is your man.  You need to bypass weekend traffic for an apt in the city?  This is your man.  You need a girls night out and want to laugh and clown?  This is your man.But this is not your man if you want an inexpensive way to the city or you want to sit in a pleasant smelling environment.  Also would be great if BART was available on weekends at least until 2 am or so.Oh and don't ride on major holidays especially New Years Eve cause you're life will be at risk!"
4,"Aug 31, 2009","BART has been around a long time & I remember riding it all over the Bay Area when I last lived up here. It still is an excellent, smooth-running operation although I will now offer a few friendly suggestions to make it better. But I am REALISTIC also and know that BART is a public agency and what with the economic tumult at hand-my words of wisdom will probably fall on deaf ears. So be it!Coming into SFO and dragging a laptop, backpack and suitcase full of clothing, I am heartened to see that there is now an airport BART stop and make a run for it with all my stuff. But first you have to get on an Air Bus-just like at Disneyland-that takes you to the actual BART stop. Once there-it's time to buy a ticket in the BART machine. Get in line. Hope you have the ride amount of money and change cause I didn't see any change machines. Finally-with ticket in hand, I knew I had to go to Daly City, but trains would come and they wouldn't be announced-just roll in and you would have to ask someone or try to see the front where the place they go is posted. Get to where I am going and fading in the heat fast! Know I have to transfer to a Muni bus & ask the BART attendant at the station about transfers or where to get change. I must have interrupted her important phone call and this devoted public servantsnarled a reply to me that I can go buy a hot dog if I need change? I apologized and thanked her for the information.Bought a hot dog as directed by the personable BART employee who looked like BART just hired her off the crack addict welfare rolls over in Oakland. As soon as I drag myself over to the bus stop-the bus pulls away  from me just as I arrive and I am left to rest on the bench amid the flying in the wind trash and San Francisco vagrants. But finally I have a cool place to sit and ponder BART! The trains are amazing technical creatures run with the efficiency to rival the trains in Switzerland and Germany-like clock-work! IT IS IN THE FALLIABLE HUM AN  ENDEAVOR that BART falls short. Not enough sensible ticket machines. Not enough change machines. No attendants to stand watch and answer questions. No human beings sitting in the little offices there that are CARING & WANT TO HELP! Everything seems to be a hassle & am imposition to them. Hell-if I was lucky enough to have a cushy, public job that I sat in a booth all day answering questions-I would think I'd died & gone to heaven!BART: 3 words: CUSTOMER SERVICE TRAINING!BART: 3 words:  DIVERSITY AWARENESS TRAINING!BART: 4 words:  SERVICE WITH a SMILE!BART: HIRE YOURSELF SOME FRIENDLY FOLKS TO REP YOU TO THE PUBLIC; those surly ones belong back at the welfare office!"
4,"Sep 13, 2009",I like bart.lower prices and service more areas.. and you'll get more people  and quit chargin to park our cars too.
4,"May 4, 2010","Dear BART,You are a great alternative to driving and to paying huge parking costs (or parking ticket costs). Your trains come on time and your service is generally reliable. Your ticket prices are about what residents of other U.S. cities pay for their transit systems. I love the EZ Rider pass (similar to FasTrack) and the electronic parking authorization. Hope you soon create an electronic version of the senior ticket (since I turn 65 next year).One question, if you don't mind...Why is it that your elevators are so often out of service? I have never seen this anywhere else. For example, the busiest skyscrapers whose elevators are in constant use, don't seem to have the problems you do. What's up with that? Having had a recent knee replacement, I (along with many others) can't do the stairs. Many stations have no street level escalators, so when the elevator's out, I'm really stuck. Please, can you get reliable elevators? Thank you."
3,"Jun 7, 2012","I wish I could smoosh all the best parts of every public transit system together and leave out the crummy stuff. Here's how BART stacks up:Bike-friendliness: 5 stars (a model for other cities' less than half-assed attempts)Frequency of trains: 4 stars (except on weekends when you best not be in a hurry)Disability access: 3 stars (please speak UP when you make announcements conductor!)Service to airport: 2 stars (be prepared to haggle your cab fare if going early on a Sunday or if your plane arrives late at night)Affordability: 1 star (fine for tourists, but a pain in the pocket if you commute in the Bay)Police shooting and killing passengers when they can't afford to pay: minus 10 zillion stars (RIP Oscar Grant, Feb 27, 1986 - Jan 1, 2009)"
1,"Jan 16, 2018","01-13-18 Pleasanton to San Francisco, and 01-15-18 San Francisco to Pleasanton.  We were staying a couple of nights in the city and had heavy luggage to deal with.  On our trip into the city the escalators all worked and we avoided any panhandlers and rude riders on the train.  We did have problems with my wife's ticket that was just purchased in Pleasanton, working in the Pleasanton and San Francisco terminals.  On our trip from the city back to Pleasanton it was ridiculous.  Several escalators were not working at Powell Street Station making it difficult to carry our one heavy roller bag to the train platform.  We dealt with two idiots that boarded somewhere in Oakland who ran into the car pointing their fingers at riders making shooting sounds. Then they had to sit in my car of all cars and talk ghetto crap to one another while listening to loud gangster rap littered with ""F"" bombs.  We were also accosted by an African American pan handler begging for money walking from car to car as the train was moving. It seems the criminals and thugs make the rules on BART and run the show.  There was no police presence or BART employee presence to deal with the idiots. Ride BART at your OWN RISK!"

2,"Dec 15, 2014","The system used for advisories is ridiculous and unhelpful. The fact that my train can be 13 minutes behind with absolutely nothing written online blows my mind! This is relatively common, late trains with no advisories. The problem is you have no one to hold you accountable, people will continue to use BART because we have no choice, but just because you have a monopoly doesn't mean you get to fail does it?! We depend on you. You throw strikes to get what you want and then we still get left with poor service and a shortened time card. Not cool, not cool."
4,"Sep 2, 2007",So I'm not sure that carpeting/fabricing the whole car was a good idea....but the trains in Chicago are just as dirty and not nearly as quiet or reliable.   Not to mention we enjoyed a free ride on a spare the air day.  Left us with a fuzzy feeling. *minus 1 for the lack of audible annoucements.  sheesh.
4,"Oct 5, 2007","I find riding a BART train far superior to riding a Muni bus or underground train. It is also a lot faster taking BART in city than muni. They have AC and have padded seats unless there is a gnarly stain on the seat. The sweetest thing about riding BART Is going to the airport you get an awesome view of the planes getting ready to take off. The main gripes are it can be very loud especially when you go underwater on the transbay tube and some times it can be late but not as late as some of the muni buses i have waited for. BART needs to go farther maybe down to San Jose and up to Sausalito, if  they can create a tunnel under the bay bridge, they should have created one under the golden gate as well."
3,"Jan 29, 2008","I've been riding BART since it came on line in 1972.  FIrst it was from Oakland to San Francisco, then Millbrae to Oakland and now, Millbrae to Embarcadero.For the past year and a half, I take BART only if I absolutely must.  I'd much rather take the SamTrans MX into the City because there are less people, they're usually the same people and the germ quotient is reduced by a huge factor.The aroma factor is also much better on the MX.  BART train aroma is not so good.  Mostly smells like pee and sweat, especially if you sit on either end of each car.  Then there's the sick people...hacking, coughing, sneezing, wheezing.  Stay home people, don't infect the rest of the population with your sickness!This morning, there was debris on the track at the 24th Street station, then a woman fainted in our car between Civic Center and Montgomery.  The car was so packed, whatever was wrong couldn't be communicated until we hit Powell Street.  Then, she exited Montgomery, or was assisted, couldn't tell.Was grateful to finally get to Embarcadero and shuffle on to work."
4,"Jan 26, 2009","Convenience, reliable, cleanliness for the most part, and where I can peacefully listen to my iPod.  That's what sums up my experience with the SF Bay's transit system.  It's there when I have when I go to work, the Warriors game, and  various parts of the bay area.  Its the solution when you dont feel like driving and dont want to be stuck with the rest of the commuters on the freeway.  Only if BART would: 1: Have a flat fee to every station ($2.00 one way like NYC's subway)2. Expand to the south bay and north bay(north seems more of a reach but still.....) so it can truly be called the Bay Area Rapid Transit. 3. Have more stations in the city.....but the always ""reliable"" MUNI takes care of that.4. 24 hour servicethen I could use it even more than I am now.  Nevertheless, a great transit system in which I can depend on"
3,"May 31, 2009","On one hand, we're lucky at least to have BART. My friends from L.A. and other places wish they had an alternative to driving (a real alternative, not buses that get stuck in the same traffic.)But it's hard to give them more than 3 stars when you have trains that only run every 15-20 minutes, puke-covered seats and carpets, and endless incidents because it's such a dumping ground for unmedicated crazy homeless people. And a lot of this crap wouldn't happen if BART really served the public instead of existing mainly to funnel over-inflated salaries to its executives' pockets.Some day, there will be an intervention."
3,"Sep 9, 2011","Pros:- It isn't Muni- Usually not too packed- Tends to keep good time, mainly since it doesn't have to deal with street trafficCons:- Old look/feel- Doesn't run often enough on weekends"
2,"Oct 29, 2014","Bart is very convenient, overpriced compared to other cities with better public transportation, and VERY NOISY especially in the tunnels. The worst part, though is how filthy some of the stations are. The Powell Street station, for example, absolutely reeks with urine smells, and looks like it hasn't seen a mop in years. I understand that there is some construction going on, but that is no excuse for the complete lack of maintenance. Clean it up, BART!"
1,"May 7, 2015","If you want to know how messed up BART's priority is, then read this.There has never been enough parking spots in the Dublin/Pleasanton station.  If you don't get there by 7:15am, then you're sunk.  Parking fee went up drastically from $1 to $3 and it didn't help.  Long wait time to get into the monthly restricted parking.For quite sometime, folks can park at nearby station, West Dublin/Pleasanton and use the Stoneridge mall parking lot and Toys 'R Us parking lot as unofficial overflow parking.  We all know that's not legit but what are the alternatives?  I wish they smarten up and let us pay for parking there.  After all, Stoneridge mall has plenty of parking near the station.If BART is a customer oriented organization, that's what they'd do.  A lot of people don't have a choice.  BART is the only public transport to get to the city and they have to drive to go to BART.  Instead of helping them, BART decided to work with Stoneridge mall to close off the parking spots nearby West Dublin/Pleasanton stations.  Those spots just sit there, empty, while commuters are reeling from finding parking, knowing they're running later and later for their work.BART can't be fixed without outside intervention.  The contempt towards its riders is palpable.   I'm actively looking for ways to cut my dependency on BART.  I suggest y'all do the same."
3,"Sep 11, 2005","BART gets me from Berkeley to a few worthwhile places in Oakland or San Francisco. It takes twice as long as driving, costs marginally more than gas these days, and doesn't pass through many neighboroods, but it does save me the trouble of trying to park in the city. I wish it were less expensive, but they're just trying to pay operating costs. To lower rates they'd have to raise local taxes or fees on something else. Maybe a special $1000 flat tax on people who own H2s..."
4,"Nov 13, 2007","$5.15 to get from the airport to Market Street??  That would have normally been worth 5 stars in my book, but the train is a little noisy....the whine from outside when the train starts cruising fast was quite annoying.Fast and cheap...can't beat that!"
4,"May 19, 2008","I ride BART a lot to get up to the Downtown or around Mission.  It's pretty efficient and there's not a huge crowd in it all the time like in NYC.  I don't mind riding it and there's always fun people to watch while you're riding.  I love the scenery out the windows going northbound after Daly City, It's really nice.However, You always have those delays right when everybody needs them.  I missed my connection from BART to Caltrain in Milbrae last time because BART was 20 minutes late.  Everybody was on the platform for an hour waiting for the next train to come through."
3,"Jun 11, 2012","OK!! So travelling in BART was a pleasure ..till about a month ago.. now, not so much.The frequency is good, stations are good, The trains are fast and there are lots of stations .. excellent.But the traffic is increasing every day, and it is getting more and more crowded. It is not BART's fault, but it would really help if the number of trains are increased for the morning and evening commute.Lately there have been delays everyday, which may be longer than 10-15 minutes. This is very irritating. Most of the times the driver does not even bother to inform us the reasons for the delay.People have to stand for 40 min and the crowd just gets bigger and more angry.  All this gets really frustrating because the cost of commute is exorbitant.All of us also received an email saying that it is going to increase further, dint we ? The cost will be justified if the expected standards for service are met.BART is an excellent service/initiative, but it is time for them to re-evaluate themselves now and make some serious changes."
3,"Nov 26, 2017","BART, is now not cheaper than driving to San Francisco.  I've travelled many times through the years, but, Friday, Nov 25th, 2017 was the scariest, dirtiest, and most expensive.  I can't believe how dirty the Sears are, the backs of the seats, the walls, the windows. You could hardly see outside.  It actually cost us more in money and time than driving. But, the threat of the ad and bodily harm was the last straw. We stopped on the way back from San Francisco at the Bayfair Station, and were waiting for a Dublin train, when 8 Teenagers started harassing the few people waiting.  They were loud, jumping through the seat dividers next to us, they were looking us over.  We did see Security waiting to unlock the train doors when we got on, but no one later at the Stations.There should have Security at ever Station, and riding & walking through the trains.  We had to add money to our ticket at Lake Merritt, and there was a guy yelling, and screaming and waving his arms around in a rage.  We quickly moved to the other side.Also, what happened to the change machines?  So many people were looking for them!BART is really neglecting the maintenance and safety of riders.Something must be done.We all know they make millions and are building new Stations, but, they still should be forced to maintain the old ones!  Lastly, bathrooms!!!! Why aren't they open? There should be janitors and Security.  They need to be open!!!I don't know what hell people do when trains are delayed?!!"
3,"Aug 20, 2005","Ok Good and Bad are equal on BART.Good: It IS clean, efficient, and plain handy when needed. If i need to get to berkley, it can get me there in less than 30 minutes from downtown san francisco. Nothing else can really do that. It also is great for getting to the airport, it is still cheaper than taking an airport shuttle. I can take a cab to the bart station and the bart to the airport and it's still cheaper.Bad: Expensive, moreso than other cities, expecially when you go further than like 5 stops. Also it doesn't really go many important places, usually i have to go to a stop and get a car ride from a friend from that stop to where i am going. I live by fishermans warf, and i get off the BART and have to pay again to get on the MUNI. They should be connected so i don't have to pay more. Also there is no monthly pass for BART. It also is loud and you loose cell phone reception every 2 seconds, which sucks when you have to call the person to pick you up at the stop you are arriving at, but that's not completely their fault, but it's still going into the score above.In all, BART is still the cheapest way to get out of town, the bay bridge costs more than BART most of the time, let alone the cost of buying a car and gas and so on."
4,"Feb 15, 2009","BART is great.  It gets me to where I need to go and fast!  Tis why I pay the extra $2.55 to ride BART instead of hoofing it onto AC Transit.However, there are some ways BART can improve:1. Designated bicycle tie-downs in ALL cars.  Seriously, holding a bike the whole trip is a bitch.2. Cleaner seats and floors.  I did not ride BART to contract Hepatitis, thank you very much.  If I want that (And more), I can visit my friendly neighborhood prostitute.That's all I can think of for now.  Hopefully the problems above can be saved with BART's new cars, which should arrive sometime next decade."
1,"Dec 26, 2015","Ridiculously rude Asian guy on south San Francisco Bart station. 12/26/15 I entered the station so he started to run after me accusing me that I didn't buy a ticket . I told him I will buy it at the exit because I don't know where I am going yet.so he started to say something like ""oh why u going if you don't know where u going "" it's not his business why and I don't have to explain every stupid worker what happened in my life. Is he really getting paid for being rude or what ? And if he thinks he did the right thing it's mistake because I am gonna complain more and more until he learn how to respect people"
3,"Jul 24, 2008","My blood pressure is certainly lower in writing my BART review than my Muni rant.  Must obtain biorythmn report.  A friendly and observant Peace Officer would certainly be a welcome sight at times - I salute BART Police for even showing up.  Must be god awful duty.  Much like a High School teacher must feel, dealing with seeming grown ups who act like spoiled brat rock stars with the manners of Attila the Hun.The seats are gross.  Cloth?  Come on.  Did I say gross?  Yes.  Gross.  What do they use in the Paris metro or the Tokyo subway?  Use that.  I'd say after having 10 trillion riders a day, perhaps they know what the F they are doing.  But this is America.  Why would we go ask the Dutch fer chrissakes how to build a dyke when the stupid-ass way we manage the Mississippi River and the New Orleans' levee systems seems to be working so freakin' well.  American ingenuity - oh yeah.  Right.  We're The Best.  Rah-rah.  Go Team Go.  One huge plus:  taking it to SFO.  Kudos to all.  This works.  Amazingly simple in concept.  Soooo very difficult in execution.  I mean, how many decades did it take to extend it to the airport?  (I believe about three decades.)  Watching the morons up in Seattle argue about extending their light rail system to Seatac Airport just boggles the mind.  ""A train to the airport?  Who wudda thunk?""  ""But it's not a money maker!"" they scream.  Public transportation is, by definition, not a profit center for a region.  It's like a police or fire department.  Infrastructure folks.  You know, like keeping the roads in working order so we can actually use them.  New concept for some.  Have to give these people extra time on the exam.A nice spit shine to the trains would be cool.  Maybe a new color?  I don't know.  I'm not a designer.  But dirty grey silver stainless is not a good look.    Running them all night only makes sense if you just happen to be in the lower 95th percentile of the population who find that we don't have an extra 50-60$ to pay to get back from our fave haunt in the City to our suburban home.  We don't want drunks on the roads after the bars close?  Then run public transit all night.  Of course, not every five minutes.  Duh.  But how about once every 45 to 60 minutes after 1:00 a.m.?  Overall I give BART a 3.  Certainly not perfect, but waaaay better than nothing.  Maybe our needs to be heard more loudly."
4,"Jan 23, 2009","BART has reallly been my key to independence.  Due to my vision disability I can't drive but can easily get on my MUNI street car to BART.    I do think the shooting incident was an abberation and  I feel relatively safe on BART,  The trains are clean, and the vast majority oof the time on time.   Someties there is elevator issues, but usually I just go to the next station and walk to my final destination.  I don't think I have ever encountered a rude station agent, though at times they could be quicker. (the new wheelchair accessible fare machines have been a godsend in this regard!) I know other places have more stops, but at least in NYC when I went, it was difficulyt to know which stops were and weren't accessible.  I find it more comparable to the Washington DC metro, and tboth of ours have gotten high marks from the disabled community. I do wish it went moore places though."
1,"Oct 1, 2010","I used to like Bart the first time using it.  But after using it everyday for the past 3 years the more I hate it.  Now I loathe it. 1. Never on timeThey are never on time and they run purposely slow during the mid morning through to the afternoon.  Even missed a flight once out of SFO because they were 30 min late and didn't bother to explain or warn us.  You can not depend on their schedules at all.  I wonder why they always stop at the same spot in between stations for a few minutes everyday.  I never understood that.  Perhaps they screwed up on their posted scheduling and thats how they make up for it.  But if they had some brains they would just wait at the station so that more people can have the chance to get off or get on the train.  Sitting in the middle of nowhere doesn't help anyone.2. CostThey are way way way too expensive.  To go from Pleasant Hill to SFO is 20 bucks round trip!  (minus 40 cents)  And to go one stop from SFO to the next station is 6.50!  Why?  So that the airport doesn't loose much money from the loss of airport parking?  It should be 2 or 2.50 anywhere jut like the subway in NY.  If one wants expensive traveling then take CalTrain.3. They don't go everywhereUnless you live next to a station and/or your destination is in walking distance of a station, its really not useful or economical. It's actually cheaper for me to drive than to take Bart, that doesn't make Bart very green. I can never get folks to want to take Bart, its way to inconvenient and if you have 2 or more people its not affordable, like if you want to take it to the city, expect to drop 24-48 dollars for a small group of people. That is crazy!Only reason I take it is that my company pays for some of my ticket and I can walk to it from work and home.  I'd rather drive to tell ya the truth, though I hate to pollute unnecessarily, but remember that electricity isn't necessarily harmless to the environment either.At least the stations out in the walnut creek area are clean.  :)  I guess paying union fees up the yin yang does do something for them."
2,"Oct 28, 2011",when it works its great but all this week its been a mess and I have been late all too many times. I am so inclined to start using a motorbike or car..Lets face it it is expensive travel so they must be able to provide a reliable service.
2,"Feb 9, 2017",Better than driving on packed freeways but late a lot. The information on delays they give out online and over the speakers inside BART is frequently wrong in the sense that it's over or understated. Can't hear the announcements.
4,"Jun 26, 2015","I just wrote a review for the AirBart and felt it necessary to write a review for it's parent:  Bart.  Also, I read a few of the negative reviews, as I tend to do.  I understand out-of-towner's frustrations.  As a long time resident of the Bay Area, I have seen how our public transportation system is no where near as convenient as Chicago's L Train or NYC's Subway.  In fact, it is damn difficult to navigate around the city.  If you do not do your homework in advance you can lose valuable time just working out how to get to your desired location.  Whether it's by Bart, Muni, cable cars, bus, or a combination of all of them; San Francisco is a mess.  I couldn't imagine navigating the city and trying to see the Palace of Fine Arts, AT&T Park, and the Painted Ladies in Alamo Park, all in the same day.  Whereas in the aforementioned Chicago and NYC, all it takes is a couple of transfers and you arrive within blocks of your destination.  So in this regard, yes we are lacking.Another area that they are lacking is in pricing.  Sure they offer a Clipper card with minimal savings on how much you load onto it, but for the most part Bart is not tourist friendly.  Cities like Chicago, Pittsburgh, NYC, and many others, offer a variety of passes that are beneficial to tourists.  Whether it's a multi-day pass, a week's pass, or a month, it provides tourists unlimited travel through their city's public transportation system for the allotted number of days purchased.  I don't know how many times this has saved me money on my travels!  Every time I visit cities with this option it upsets me that the Bay Area has been slow to adopt some sort of ""weekend pass"" that would encourage using their public transportation.  For that ... one star deduction.  For the reviewers from the Bay Area ... sure Bart may not be ""clean,"" but what public transportation system is?  You sit in the seats at your own risk.  Standing is ALWAYS an option, just make sure you always carry a thing of Purell ;)  I've seen the clientele that frequent Bart and am amazed that it doesn't look worse!  I think they do a great job cleaning/updating all of their cars.  Like some of the other Yelpers have stated, it sure beats the bus :)In terms of being on time, I have the Bart app on my phone and things thing has been a life saver.  If I am at the game, restaurant, or bar, I can plan my departure with the trains arrival to make the most out of my evening.  No wasteful waiting around for 5-15 minutes for the next train.  Sure delays happen, but for a system that runs all year they do a fine job.  Just make sure that if you are cutting it close that you just pick up your kids and haul tail to the station.  So to wrap this up, I gave it 4-stars because of how useful Bart has been for me.  For Giants games, city events, touring downtown Oakland or San Francisco, and getting to the airports, Bart beats driving.  Just plan ahead, estimate the time needed, and be fully prepared to see some interesting characters.  Sit and touch things at your own risk.  As they say ... ""Bart and you are there.  Boop Boop""SIDENOTE:  For all the visitors to the Bay Area ... Watch out for panhandlers.  They are more cunning and creative as time passes.  The last guy I saw was VERY convincing, but was a liar and a cheat all the same.  Do not fall for them.  The last guy I saw asked everyone in the Bart for their attention and gave this speech:""Oh man,  Oh geeze, this is embarrassing.  Hi everyone, and thank you for your time *insert fake tears/crying*  My son is at SFO and just missed his flight to Chicago.  He has $130, but was told he needs $300 for a ticket.  I have already collected $90 from the previous car, from such caring people, and just needs help to cover the remaining $80.  I am a Veteran of the Army and served in Iraq as a medic.  Whatever you give to me I promise to mail you double as long as you provide me your address.  *More tears and sniffling*  My boy is scared and won't ask anyone for help.  I need any amount for him.  Please help!""Needless to say many people chipped in.  From my estimation he made $65 from the car I was in alone.  Only reason I know is because I was sitting near the door to the next car he was going to hit up and saw the money in his hand.  Not only that, but the guy in front of me gave him $20.  Convincing right?!?  I almost believed the story too ... that is, until he moved to the next train car and started the speech again.  Guess what .... He still needed $80!  He just regurgitated the same speech he gave the car before.  Funny thing was, once he saw me (who he recognized from the previous train) he quickly collected whatever money from the car he could and got off at the next stop.  Why didn't I call him out?  I was so dumbfounded at the level he sank to.  Since then I have beat myself up for not exposing him, but here I am to redeem myself.  So ... if you see this guy (usually on the weekends)  DO NOT FALL FOR IT."
4,"Jun 26, 2015","I am a BIG fan of Bart.  It is convenient, fast, and the easiest way to avoid traffic.  When this finally opened up I was excited at the possibility of finding flights out of Oakland OR San Francisco AND being able to access either one by a train system.  My big surprise was the cost for a one way travel.  It was $6 for this 8-10 minute ride.  This is my primary reason for giving it a 4 star rating instead of 5 stars.  Comparing it to SFO, the connection from the station to the other terminals is free.  Granted Bart takes you right up to the ""SFO Airport"" stop.  Comparisons aside, I am pleased that AirBart is up and running.  It now becomes another factor in my travel planning.  It all comes down to plane ticket price (out of OAK or SFO), travel time to the airport via Bart, and the convenience factor.  All in all, I recommend using AirBart, but just be prepared for the cost!  All things considered, some times the airfare out of Oakland is cheaper than out of SFO; when adding in the price of Bart it all comes out in the wash.  I will take a 40 minute Bart ride over a hour and 25 minute Bart ride from the Dublin station ANY DAY!!"
1,"Sep 5, 2014",Yay!!! Another day I get to miss my transfer train. That's five this month. Update. 10/2 Train stuck on platform. Moved all passengers off trains up to another platform. 10 minutes later we go back down. 30 minute delay.
1,"Jul 3, 2014",SF BART totally screwed OAK Airport customers today by NOT taking BART cards and forcing us to come up with cash! NO warning. NO signs. NO exception. NO time to walk anywhere to get cash and make our flights!
1,"May 9, 2014",Sucks compared to all the other public transits in other metropolitan cities. BART did improve by changing to plastic seat covers from cloth.
4,"Sep 5, 2015",To Use the ticket machine you have to pay first and then you can choose your options to buy what tickets you need so put your money in the machine only gives you back change $4.50 so you have to be very exact.
1,"Feb 22, 2015","So incompetent. 20% of the time you take it, it gets delayed. ""We appreciate your patience,"" I'm calling bullshit. They would do something to fix the problems if they actually cared about our patience, but they just take our cash and laugh at us."
1,"May 8, 2014","3 short meetings, hours apart, all near BART. You think you can make it? I know NOT.When I got home dinner no longer was HOT. If you have something to get done, DRIVE YOUR CAR"
1,"Oct 14, 2015","20-30 minute delays are a fairly regular regular occurrence (2-3/week for me); medical emergencies due to poor air circulation in ancient, over-packed cars; filth everywhere.Is it better than driving still?  Maybe, but it's definitely a legitimate debate at this point.Aging infrastructure, lack of maintenance, and most importantly, poor planning have taken a major toll on the system."
1,"Jan 6, 2015","Everyday... Every damn day there is a medical emergency on the 8am trains. If you have meetings for work, you better plan on taking Bart 2 hours early if you want to hopefully be on time. Completely unreliable and worthless."
1,"Nov 8, 2011","Dear BART, I didnt know a train could be a tyrant and a monopoly, but you prove me wrong. Thank you for not caring about your customers WHATSOEVER. You insist on making those customers that ride you everyday to use a Clipper, as outlets will no longer offer tickets in turn for vouchers. The Clipper often doesnt allow you to get through stalls efficiently, which results in us missing trains. You made my boyfriend spend $5.20 to enter a station, pay for my parking, and immediately leave said station. Guess why he had to do that for me? THE CLIPPER MAGICALLY WASNT WORKING. How strange!I would like to add you to the ""Occupy Oakland"" list. Thank you, BART, for more often than not, getting my day off to a bad start. And shame on you for making so much money on us! It must be going into training your highly qualified BART police, no??"
5,"May 30, 2012",Yaaaaaahh!! Finally new seats!!! It was very pleasant to ride today in a BART car that had new seat covers. I think they probably should of gone darker in color since they are made out of some sort of vinyl material it won't be long before graffiti is alll over their brand new clean look.
4,"Jun 29, 2012","BART is a good system San Fran has. I got a clipper card and it worked on all the public transportation systems in San Fran. The clipper card allows you to put any amount on it so you can charge the card for whatever you think you will use. Also, you can charge the card at a local Walgreens or at a local BART station ATM. The BART employees were help full and informative. I like the public transportation system you guys have and the connectivity to local buses is good as well.You do have to improve on the speakers and letting travelers know where they are and what stop the train is stopped at. I couldn't  hear a thing coming out of the speakers as to which stops we are stopping at and I almost missed my stop so you need better signs on what each stop is and the speakers need to be better as well so we know where we stopping at. Same goes for each station. When we are stopped at the civic center stop the maps there doent help much with the timing on when each train comes and how long it takes to get to a certain location. Over all good but just need to make some improvements."
3,"Mar 31, 2012","DONT BUY BART TICKETS FROM SOMEONE YOU DON'T KNOW!there are lots of them for sale on craigslist. beware!My girlfriend had three credit cards stolen from her purse last night, while at an art show off Market street. Before we even realized what had happened,the thief purchased over $1000 in BART cards from the civic center BART station. We reported it very quickly. These tickets can be tracked by the police and BART will cancel them.Buying BART cards from credit card thieves may save you a couple bucks, but it perpetuates crime against hard working honest people."
3,"Aug 7, 2014","Overall I like BART but their evening/night scheduling is poor and could be greatly improved.  People will use BART more when the wait times are less and you can count on efficient transportation.  So instead of 10 car trains every 20 minutes at night you should have 4 car trains every 6 or 7 minutes so that no matter when you show up there is only a couple minutes wait to the next train - like a real city and like nearly every major public transit in the world.  Oh gosh, Stan, doesn't that mean having more drivers on duty?  Why yes, BART, but I guarantee that $30/hour burdened cost will be more than made up by revenue gains for what, five extra riders per hour, when people can count on quick and convenient service."
2,"Feb 4, 2012","I really have no idea why people give Bart 3 and 4 stars. This is a 2 star ride at best and it only gets those stars because of locations and general safety (because when the Bart police will kill you crime seems to go down).I have been on trains and subways all over in the US and Europe and with the waiting times between trains, number of people being forced into cars because of the waits, and the price - they have a long way to go to hit a 4 star level or above. The smell is pretty bad as well - right on par with L.A. except with less exhaust fumage mixed in.At least with my hybrid I don't feel guilty taking my car and being clean and germ free upon arriving to my destination!"
5,"Jun 22, 2006","I don't regularly use Bart or any of the public transportation and I didn't today either - but that's because I don't need it (I walk to work). But I think its a great thing, and I think it's wonderful that they have Spare the Air Day and promote it by giving a day of free public transportation. That is awesome initiative to promote pubic transportation and raise awareness of the problems of pollution. So for that, I give BART 5 stars!"
4,"Mar 31, 2014","Overall, BART provides the best way to get around the eastern side of SF and the western side of the East Bay.  It is about as cheap as driving particularly if you are crossing the Bay and have to pay toll.  It saves time too - it can take an hour (sometimes over two even on weekends) to get from Berkeley/Oakland to SF during peak hour, versus some 25 minutes on BART.  BART is not too cheap, but let's be real.  It operates in the one of the most expensive areas in the country.  The Bay also does not have the population to lower cost through ticket sales, so I don't think comparing NYC's cost to BART is fair.  On a weekday, more than 6x more people ride the NY metro than live in the City by the bay.  That has to be taken into caccount when casting judgement between the two systems.BART is expanding their computer systems to increase the number of trains running, and they seem to be making some important expansions to the South Bay which will provide them a better way to get to SF than Caltrain, although the upcoming electrification of Caltrain will improve its service around the time BART reaches Diridon.  Now, the bad:  I am not going to complain about the clientele being rowdy, drunk, or homeless.  This is an urban metro system, you will have to deal with people that are not like you.  Yes, Ive on many occasions witnessed crazies or ""police activity"" between Civic Center and 24th st, but I have never felt in any danger.  I know this is a long shot, and there is a good reason for MUNI to do this instead of BART, but the City needs some better form of transit into the Richmond.  If not MUNI, BART should expand (or plan to expand) under Geary and eventually across the Golden Gate into Marin (which is the reason BART should do it instead of MUNI, as MUNI doesn't operate in Marin).  BART is expanding their inefficient E-BART service to Contra Costa, a sparsely populated area when compared to the Richmond.  Yes, it would be be exponentially more expensive to tunnel under Geary and build under the Golden Gate, but it would provide much needed traffic relief to Geary and the Golden Gate, as well as direct public transit from the rest of the Bay to Marin, northern SF, and Golden Gate Park.  This is what the City's traffic needs the most.  My biggest qualm about BART is its operating hours.  What will it take to get 24 hour service?  They always say that they need to close the Tube every day for maintenance.  I don't buy that.  Why can't you run single track between 1am and 5am?  What is the issue with having one train every 30 minutes cross the bay during night hours, exactly what they do on New Years and other holidays?  Honestly, at least run the Sunday schedule at 1/5 sunday capacity so people won't be stranded after midnight.  What will it take?  More ridership?  Well SF's population is expanding, and so is the East Bay's.  At least give us an extremely limited service during night hours."
1,"Jun 26, 2013","BART UNION BOOOO - Shame on you.It is incomprehensible to the average worker, who has to earn their pay increases, (small ones at that) and has to pay for a percentage, if not all of their medical benefits, to watch the BART Unions bleed everything they can from their employer.  The BART Unions continue to drive our fares up and up and then takes as much as they can, so that there is nothing left to spend on decent facilities and services.  Shame on you for being so greedy!  When a Union steps in to protect the workers to the degree that they no longer have to perform, it is a slap in the face to the average worker.  We watch as BART employees do less than their best at keeping their stations clean and operable.  We put up with rude and mouthy BART employees that have NO sense of customer service.  We stand by, helpless, as the Unions demand pay increases and threaten strikes when people all over this nation are taking pay cuts and getting laid off.  On occasion a BART employee goes out of their way and has a nice disposition, but these employee's are rare and we thank the UNIONS for creating these monsters that feel they are owed unjust pay and benefits.Shame on you!"
2,"May 28, 2015","The parking fees used to be $1, now it's $3. Luckily I was able to take the Contra Costa County Connection express bus and leave the car at home, it was also useful with not being stuck in traffic with all the other morons who can't drive around here.2.  The trains are usually crowded, but before I even get to what goes on inside the train, let me elaborate on what's going on when you stand inline. People come in at the last moment and just pass you and the line like you're not there.3. Then you get to the train and things become even more interesting, you'll encounter all sorts of characters.  Homeless people whom you can smell from a mile away, mentally ill people who will be screaming/cussing and talking about all their problems, stuck up CA women who spend too much time on their smart phone and wondering who they will marry and how much money they will gain and the list goes on.4. Hopefully you'll find a decent seat without urine, feces or some other crap all over it.5. Then it's time to get off the train (MacArthur Station) and you can barely get off the train because of the swarm of people outside waiting to come on-board.  I usually greet them with LET ME GET OFF THE TRAIN PLEASE!! in a nice loud commanding voice (works most of the time).6. The bathrooms are DISGUISTING,   filth, urine, dirt, graffiti etc etc.  You'd be better off waiting or pissing your pants. 7. Coming back and getting off the train in Walnut Creek trying to grab a discount ticket for the bus, people pretend like you are not there or they don't see you.I am so GLAD to leave California and this $h1ty BART behind."
2,"Jan 15, 2014","Works decently most of the time to fulfill its main function, which is obviously to transport people around the Bay Area. Unfortunately, BART lags behind many other public transportation systems. Trains are all old and clearly not designed to cope with high volumes of traffic, with only 2 doors per side in each train and transverse seats make for narrow aisles, meaning it's hard to move around within the car. No public information displays or automated announcements regarding next station or interchange info. Motors and screeching wheels get inordinately loud, drowning out the voice of the operator as well as any conversations you might be having. The cloth seats and floors all look dirty. No mobile phone reception in some tunnels. The fact that BART runs trains of differing lengths can be a bit confusing at first as well. Stations are all aging and definitely show it, although some modifications help a bit. The black vs. yellow tiles to indicate where the doors will be positioned are helpful, and there are screens showing when the next trains are due. Other than that, poor signage in general. A lot of stations just have that drab Brutalist look so it's hard to tell what station you're at. Fare gates are old and slow; Clipper card readers don't read the cards very well and it takes multiple taps to register at times. Ticket/Clipper top-up machines aren't user-friendly and are clunky to use. Cross-platform timed interchanges are perhaps one of the few things that BART has managed to get right. Clear labour issues; why are strikes even permitted for a service that's clearly so essential to the Bay Area? Staff, when they're working, are often surly and unhelpful. Fares are relatively high, although definitely cheaper than driving. Direct access to SFO is nice, and is actually a serviceable way to get to the airport if you don't have too much luggage."
1,"Jun 29, 2014",Too crowded on a sunday. People are going to the Pride Parade and nobody wants to drive.
2,"Feb 27, 2015","I am all for mass transport, but BART housekeeping has been lacking. Lots of debris between seats on the Pittsburgh/Bay Point line, and either some foul odor, or the unbearable smell of harsh chemicals, other lines are even dirtier. I really hope they shape up soon, as I wonder how many people receive illness from taking BART, one time as I was sitting down, I noticed used toilet paper jammed between the seat and the wall...that is a recipe for disaster..."
3,"Jun 8, 2008","i have a love-hate relationship with bart. hate:smelly homeless people who ride the train all day stinking up a car, especially on a hot daylove: takes me to where i want to go on a (mostly) dependable schedule and in a reasonable amount of time to most places outside of the city.hate:cost for a round trip ticket out to see my parents is about as much a good meal at a restaurant.love AND hate:shuts down at 12am. i love it because it prevents me from staying out all night in parts unknown. i hate it because i can't party like a rock star any longer and it's just a sad reminder that i am now a grown-up and must go to bed by 1am or be completely useless the next day.love:my time spent on bart is used to read/listen to music/study/people-watch/sleep/eat/drink coffee and there's not an issue of finding parking or paying for $4/gallon for an automobile.hate:not enough trains. cloth versus plastic seating (contributes to smelly factor). not enough seats. scary dudes who try to talk to me."
4,"Oct 11, 2009","I was charged about 8.00 dollars to go from SF Intl Airport to the 24th and Mission station, which wasn't too bad. It did not take long to get to our destination because Bart was fast on the straightaways. I also used it to go back to SFO. I really like that you could use a Debit card to purchase your ticket. It was on time and not complicated."
4,"Jul 13, 2007","I grew up taking BART, so maybe I'm just generous for sentimental reasons. For all the crap BART gets, they're actually a lot more efficient and pleasant to take than other transit systems in other major cities. Have you checked out the Paris Metro, the London Underground, or the New York Subway? (OK, maybe not quite the same as the Metro, Underground, or Subway, but along the same lines...) I can't speak to promptness but I can speak to cleanliness and comfort level. Considering the grand aspirations of the BART designers (cloth upholstery, carpeting, etc...) and the quality of a fraction of the riders, this crap is pretty damn pleasant to ride on. Also, aside from the sporadic tube fires, suicide jumpers, and criminal activity, there are few serious delays. A frequent inter-San Francisco rider, I notice the delays a lot more than your standard commuter and I still give them 4 stars. The smooth ride usually puts me so at ease that I am able to fall asleep and miss my stop. When this happens (which is often), I thank god that BART does run frequently enough that I can hop on a train running the opposite direction and still get to my intended destination in a reasonable amount of time. Minus one point for the ease with which the tickets demagnetize, forcing me to visit the little BART staff window at least once a week and forcing me to lose countless dollars throwing away the demagnetized tickets instead of going through the hassle of getting the demagnetized tickets replaced. The BART stations are also pretty okay, my only complaint is the lack of bathrooms. But that's just so people don't smoke crack in them. And crack is bad. So I can support that. Don't smoke crack and don't hate on BART. If they raise prices one more time, they lose a star from this rider."
2,"Jun 2, 2015","Bart has been failing to automate their trains and schedules for 40 years.Every time I 'need' BART to be on-time, they are 20 minutes late.Today, I checked online when the next Pittsburg/Bay Point train would arrive in Oakland.The BART web page said 10 minutes.I walked to the BART station, swiped my card, got to the platform (packed with stranded people) and once again, the train is 20 minutes late.This seems to be a once a week occurrence at 19th street during rush hour.   I left the station.  To enter the station and then immediately leave cost $5.60 !!!!  Having ridden BART for 40 years, I have finally had enough of their pompous arrogance and poor service.  If your schedule permits you to be late and miss bus connections (and you don't mind shoulder-to-shoulder standing BO during rush hour), BART is an acceptable car alternative.It is back to the car for me!"

""let's encourage drunk driving by not running the BART past 12:30 so that we can give out more tickets!  AND people from the east bay will get stuck here on the weekends so they'll either have to take taxis home or stay in a hotel = more money for SF.""the only two redeeming qualities BART has, in my opinion, are: it earned coolness points for being in the film ""THX 1138"" and it' s better for the environment than driving a gas hogging vehicle.dear BART HQ,please run the BART 24 hours to cut down on drunk drivers.  please clean up your nasty trains& stations.  i think your prices have gone up TWICE in the past year and have we seen any of the benefits come back to us as riders?  NO!thank you."

I don't think so.BART/Pro's:-It's waaaaaaay CHEAPER than parking in SF.-It beats sitting in traffic any day!-It's faster than Muni. ;p-There's a Peet's Coffee @some of their stations. Nice, SO convenient, & sometimes MUCH needed in the morning.-It links directly to SFO and OAK airports.Tips:-If you encounter a homeless person talking to themself, better to leave them alone.  -Don't be a meanie and sit on the ""outer"" seat when the ""inner seat"" only occupies your bag. Having a bag doesn't constitute an extra seat.-Don't try & slip your way into a train that's in process of shutting its doors. Chances are you'll get stuck & cause a delay on the train. Relax, there will be another train coming soon. =)-Do remember take ALL your belongings with you. If you leave behind your lunch bag, they will delay the ride to ""inspect"" the contents.-When on the escalator departing the station, make sure you stay on the RIGHT side if you don't plan on walking. Tourists standing on the left side often get sighs and groans from people wanting to get through. SO, if you didn't know, NOW you know.-Lastly, just SMILE. Hardly anyone on BART does it anymore, and frankly if you do its pretty contagious. Let's get some friendly faces on your daily commute to work people!! =)"
5,"Aug 20, 2005","I ride BART roughly twice a year, when I need to fulfill family obligations and visit my cousin and his wife in Walnut Creek. It's not convenient unless you're within walking distance of a station (which I'm not), but it's clean, runs on schedule, and allows me to read or doze instead of dealing with traffic on the Bay Bridge. If I'm going to be subjected to my cousin's wife's dreadful cooking, I may as well be comfortable getting there and back. No doubt regular users are aware of all its flaws, but for once-in-awhile riders like myself, it's a viable alternative to driving and a lot less expensive than a tankful of gas."

2,"Aug 25, 2015","This is for out-of-area visitors in order to set expectations correctly.1.  If you arrive during rush hour, be prepared for shorter trains. BART runs short trains during the peak hours. Don't ever expect to have a seat.2. No matter when you arrive, use the facilities at your airport or hotel. The BART restrooms are either always locked (downtown stations) or filthy and with a drug addict inside.3.  The air conditioning doesn't work in many of the train cars, so don't expect comfort.4.  The escalators in stations aren't always working. For example, the escalator in the Embarcadero station has been under repair for 3 weeks. Elevators are also unreliable, so pack lightly, you may be carrying your luggage for a long walk.5.  Bicycles have priority over any other passengers, so expect someone with a bike to push on the train no matter how crowded, rush hour or not. BART has no idea how to manage bicycles, so they just let them run rampant. You'll see.6.  Frequent breakdowns, police actions, medical emergencies mean that BART is extremely unreliable; you must have lots of patience to take this transport.7.  In an emergency, you won't be able to contact the train operator via the in-car intercoms, they don't work. Just get off the train safely.Good luck, enjoy the Bay Area, be prepared for BART."

5,"Jun 14, 2007","I love this little mobile site.  I use it all the time.  Once the ""Advisories"" section is up and running it will be perfect.

It also has a link to the system map right on the homepage which is just oh so nice!"
4,"May 2, 2007","It's like the monorail except it smells like urine and it doesn't go to Disney World.  It's fairly consistent, cheaper than other trains, and runs frequently (but could run later).  It can also be a bit confusing for people who are new to the system.The environmentalist in me is compelled to give it the forth star.  ...and I love the BART mobile site.  You can check quickly and easily exactly when the next train should be coming, check for advisories, and bike rules.It'd be better if the seats came with headphone jacks like there are on airplanes and if there were cellphone signal boosters on the train.  Boo on the people who complain about people being on their phones!  We could never be as annoying as Oakland highschool students shouting profanity at each other because they think it makes them look cool!"
3,"Feb 13, 2009","I envy cities with real subway systems, i.e., those that actually connect the different parts of a city (I am from Los Angeles; I don't know what *that* is).  In addition to the usual top dogs--New York City (genius), Paris (wonderful), Seoul (smooth sailing), Tokyo (complete with passenger protocol), Hong Kong (I bust out my Octopus Card and I'm good to go), London (other than some parts of outer London, connects A-okay)--Washington, D.C. springs to mind as a small community that is serviced by a most efficient, bafflingly clean Metro.Now the comparison, or contrast, rather, with BART.  This bloody thing does not even attempt to connect the relatively small square footage (for a major metropolitan city and population) of San Francisco.  I get that it is for the Bay Area, in general, which is why I am giving it 3 stars.  But, if you do not work in East Bay or South Bay, thus just using BART for a simple one direction commute, you can fuhgetaboutit.  I wanted to go to this mouthwateringly amazing pizza place that happens to be in Potrero Hill and my friend replied, ""There's no BART stop there.""  Damnit, thanks for bringing me here, BART, from Berkeley, but would it kill you to drop me off on your way down to Burlingame?  This is when MUNI steps in and takes over, but those buses hardly move like clockwork.  And the things you witness on them give you a bit of pause.  Not that I can't roll like that.  I don't really care, as soap and water takes care of nearly everything.  But, like I said, they are never on time.  My last annoyance about BART is that it is kind of expensive for what it is.  A few more dollars than D.C.'s Metro, but the Metro will take you everywhere, including Bethesda, MD.  Just not the biggest fan of BART."
1,"Nov 3, 2016",I have been commuting since 2004 from North concord to so san francisco and trains dirty and over crowded and always late. Bart suck and bart police lazy !!!!

4,"Jun 30, 2008","haha, oh bart. we've shared some good times.i remember when i was a little girl, my dad never told me that bart goes underwater because he knew i'd get scared. and he was right. when i found out i got scared and was crossing my fingers the entire time underwater. Anyway, 10 years later and i still get a little nervous. haha. i just sit there praying that an earthquake doesn't hit.But i am willing to pay 10 bucks, risk my life, and be back on it by 12 if it gets me out of driving. if i need to stay out later than that i just crash at a friends in San Fran, or by a bum on the stairs. body heat, people.but really. if you're planning on staying in San Fran late and getting intoxicated, being on bart isn't a good idea.

No how are any of the East Bay kids going to come over to SF to hang out if they always have to leave by 11:00? Huge design flaw.  That's like operating a commuter shuttle service in a city with no airport."

While I was in the tube under the bay coming home a 5.6 earthquake hit.  The biggest since '89.  Keep in mind I ride from the Embarcadero to west Oakland, that's a total of 6 minutes on the train.

I can say I don't miss the stained seats, rude passengers, and electronic device enthralled zombie crowds. I will however miss the diversity of people that cross bart paths - from hippie to drug dealers to rich ceo types who are going through the commuter phase for a week. It's a beautiful array of weirdos and regulars and almost always unpredictably inefficient. One little minor hiccup at a train station four stops away will throw your whole game off by 45 minutes.

It's a public transit system which is ridiculously overpriced, and may give you a virus which actually kills 19,000 people per year.Yes indeed, kids. Just because they've successfully colluded to remain the only semi-reasonable choice to get places (like SFO) doesn't mean you have to support them. I drive whenever I possibly can in the bay because I always feel dirty and violated after being taken for a BART ride. Ten bucks to the airport?? I'd rather stay healthy and make it in half the time by using a shuttle service for $30. What is your health and sanity worth to you? Seriously.If you're down to listen to someone else's music, engage a crazy person in unsolicited conversation, wonder whether the cushion you're on has any of the things the professor in the article found, pay four times as much as a New Yorker or a Bostonian to ride for an hour, contribute to overpaid workers' salaries and bonuses, all while spending just enough not to have a car, then BART is for you!I've found used tissues, condoms, and a loaded diaper all in the last year of my infrequent-as-possible rides. On many parts of the system, you can't make a phone call because of the ridiculous screeching noises. People yell to continue their conversations through the ""trans-bay tube"".  And forget BART helping you get home from a night of drinking, if that's your forte - last train out is around midnight. Forcing people to drive if they want to stay out late is great. And safe.Want super job security, though? Get hired with BART if you can feel good about taking money you don't deserve from others. You'll have a cushy job pushing buttons (which can then be overridden by the control center which is actually running the show anyway), mumbling into a microphone about some stations you're coming up to, and you probably won't get fired unless you just don't show up for a month, or you punch someone in full view of passengers. You'll get close to $100,000 a year to start for ""operating"" a train; $70,000 annually to sit on your well fed tuchis behind glass giving attitude to riders at a station; $90000 to stand around watching that one guy work on one of the trains (it takes a village of supervisors to make things work in the bay area).Yes, BART truly is the way to be taken for a ride if you can't afford a car (because you're spending so much on BART every day), don't want to stay out late, don't have an hour to try and park downtown, or are otherwise desperate to get somewhere. Bring your wallets - and Lysol!"

1,"Mar 10, 2009","I'm with Matt H and give this incredibly craptacular public transit system exactly what it's earned - ONE STAR. (can't pick zero)I could write an entire essay on why BART is the absolute bottom of the barrel for public transit, but I will stick to a few points:-BART is overpriced - for a reason. BART executives make six-figure incomes each year, give themselves raises, and bonuses, and do virtually NOTHING with the excessive amount of money they abscond when you ride. When was the last time you got on an unscented BART train? When was the last time you stopped and thought to yourself, ""Wow, this is a clean station!""? When was the last time you were able to use a restroom at a station? And if it was recent, were you afraid to touch anything inside, including the floor?? The answer to all 3 questions: 1975 or thereabouts.Not only do Bay Area residents pay into the mediocrity which is BART through the 1/4% added sales tax, but many who DO pay that extra tax are nowhere close to a station! For the nearly $15 it costs to get to the airport from Contra Costa, what has BART done to show for it? LINED THEIR POCKETS with the money from yours! Which brings me to the next point...-BART is corrupt. ""Expose"" articles were printed on the front pages of major Bay Area newspapers a few years ago, decrying the excessive earnings of everyone from the execs to the drivers (who make $30+ an hour - to START!), and outlining in detail how corrupt and money-hungry the BART setup is. It was outrageous! It was appalling! It was upsetting! And yet what did the complacent, supposedly outraged Bay Area residents do the next day...?? THEY RODE THE TRAIN! Way to go, Bay Area. You get what you deserve.-Fares are more expensive than gasoline - even last year when it was over $3 a gallon!To drive from Pleasant Hill to SFO (roughly 40 miles) costs about $4.50 in today's gas price. BART ticket price: $7.05, which adds up to a staggering $14.10. In NYC, that would get you SEVEN one-way rides to anywhere on the subway. In Boston, you'd get more than EIGHT one-way rides anywhere. Distance-based pricing is a JOKE. But it certainly ensures the continued fat-cat salaries of the unionized lackeys running the monopolistic BART system. Oh, and if you're going with at least one friend on BART, consider this: Round-trip fare for two to SFO - $28.20; gas + bridge toll in a car with only 20mpg - $13.00. That's MORE THAN TWICE the cost. Carpooling for a night on the town? The per-person savings is a no-brainer, even if you valet your car in the city!-Inefficiency runs rampant, and is completely unpredictable.My wondrous jaunt on the illustrious BART yesterday took me from the Oakland Airport to Walnut Creek. Of course, I had to transfer trains, and in typical BART style, their definition of ""commute hours"" for the Pittsburg-Gun Point train meant that after 5:48pm, trains would only be coming every 15 minutes or so. Very practical. No shock that once the train pulled in (3 minutes late), it was packed to the gills and i barely fit in, leaning onto the ""DO NOT LEAN ON DOORS"" sign to avoid sexually harassing the people around me. These trains are about as punctual as Alaska Airlines, with the customer service attitude of United Airlines, and the trains look like a UPS package - beaten and filthy.-Smells, sights, sounds!Less than two weeks ago, I was again forced to ride the revolting trains to the east bay. As I boarded at Coliseum station, a mother and her boyfriend/baby daddy disembarked. Once I was on board, I noticed that they'd left a present for the next riders: a Subway bag with napkins in it, and next to it, a rolled up dirty diaper. Surprising? Not at all. So, attempting to be helpful, I picked the diaper up carefully and dropped it into the Subway bag and left it on the seat. When I reached my transfer station, I picked the bag up with one pinky finger and carried it to what I'd hoped would be a nearby trash can. Well, there was NO TRASH CAN on the platform! I ended up being forced to leave it on a bench. Maybe that teenage mom was smarter than me - she knew there would be few, if any, places to leave the damn thing!-Safety: Our Number Twelve PrioritySure, we all know that you may be one of the lucky winners of a gunshot to the back, but that's just the BART Police. When they're not around, there's no shortage of savory characters riding all around you. Even in commute time. Join in on a conversation the person next to you is having with themselves out loud. Rock back and forth in sync with the homeless. Pick up the beat of a nearby inconsiderate rider's blaring iPod. Bring something messy to eat - if it drips all over the seat, the 1970s upholstery will absorb it in no time. And from today's BART website -Today's Special: Station AdvisoriesThere is a 15-minute delay at San Francisco Int'l Airport in the SF / Pittsburg-Bay Point direction due to police activity.Enough said. GO BART!"
2,"Jun 9, 2005","BART is too expensive for the service it provides and I'd really like to know why it is so expensive and so glitchy.  For example, they paid some hefty sum to a contractor for some switching software, I believe, when the new extension to Millbrae/SFO was built, but that software is reportedly screwed up and trains are often delayed as a result, making commutes down there frustrating.  My understanding is they are sitting around waiting for the contractor and the sub-contractor to sort out who needs to fix the software.  This is sheer bullshit.  This is a huge public organization and it needs to grow some hair and start kicking ass and taking names until that software is FIXED.  I've heard the most laughably wimpy public statements by BART representatives on this, saying things like ""Our hands our tied, because it's a dispute between the contractor and subcontractor...""  My customers wouldn't put up with that, my public agencies shouldn't either. But while I'm handing out brickbats, the people of the Peninsula should be ASHAMED of themselves for rejecting BART--which is my understanding of why it doesn't go down the Peninsula.  With a larger rider pool and comprehensive coverage, and more frequent and fast service compared to Caltrain, BART could presumably dramatically increase its ridership to pay the general overhead and make a huge impact on the horrific traffic on our highways in these areas.   While San Francisco is patting itself on the back in being named this week the Greenest City in the country, the broader Bay Area should hang our heads in shame that our mass transit is this jumbled and poorly utilized."

5,"Jun 21, 2005","UPDATE: Bart now gets five stars because they have just become the only public transit service in the entire United States that makes it cheaper for me to drive my car wantonly through the Bay Area. Now I can avoid your piss-soaked, stinky service. THANKS!If I could give BART a half star rating, I would.  Bart claims that it is the best transportation system in the country.  The ads are plastered on trains, posters and in stations.  Oh, and by the way let's not call them trains.  Train implies that there are comfortable seats, nice scenery (not tunnels of darkness), amenities and interesting destinations (not Fremont and Richmond).  More like monorail.  Whoever ranked this the best system in the country has issues, or there was no competition; like a baseball team that wins due to a forfeit.  Bart is constantly breaking down, the system costs way too much to use for the distances that are offered.  It costs nearly three dollars to ride from West Oakland to San Francisco.  That is a distance of roughly seven miles.  You get no transfers so once you leave the station, screw you buddy.  Come back in and pull your pants down and cough it up for another fun ride on the single line going to nowhere.  The problem with the transportation around here is a lack of shared systems.  Bart, SamTrans, MUNI, and AC Transit cannot continue to survive working separately and fees for each will continue to skyrocket and make a trip on the London Underground seem like pennies.  Oh and don't even bother staying in the city for a drink or ten if you live anywhere outside the city.  Bart wants you to apparently get in your car and drive across the hideous Bay Bridge drunk, and failing that they would much rather you pass out in a heap on the electric third rail of their horrid 1960s designed beehive stations.  San Francisco is one of the best cities in the world, yet the main transpo cannot manage to run 24 hours?  Buses and transportation systems in Omaha probably run longer hours.  Next time Bart wants to crown itself the best transportation system in the country, they better at least ask their riders."

5,"Nov 7, 2010","Prior to my experience with the BART, I was never a fan of public transportation. On previous visits to the Bay area, I would normally either rent a car or drive my own vehicle to the area. However, on my most recent trip to San Francisco, my friends insisted that we opt for public transportation.We took the BART from a station near Oakland Airport to Downtown San Francisco (and back for our return trip). Certainly, the time it took utilizing the BART as opposed to driving in a personal car or taxi was fractional; it saved a lot of time (though there was a few minutes in which our train was stopped/delayed in the underwater tunnel). Moreover, the cost was certainly reasonable -- as we didn't have to pay for a rental car, fuel, tolls, or parking.All in all, public transportation in SF rocks! I'm a big fan now."

2,"Oct 15, 2013","I ride BART everyday to and from work. It's usually smooth and on time. So I would give it a 5*...if it weren't for the way they are handling and communicating on the bargaining process.Today's e-mail read ""We apologize the Bay Area continues to have to wait until the middle of the night to find out if union leadership will allow the trains to run each morning."" Yeah sure put all the blame on the unions. What a childish ""it's not me it's them"" way to communicate.BART Management's communication has been so poor throughout the 6+ months the bargaining has been taking place, I am losing faith in BART's ability to manage. My daily commute has been tainted by the anti-union propaganda. The reality is that BART can't operate their trains without unions and they better start showing some leadership. Beginning with the way they communicate with their riders and all the Bay Area dwellers who are impacted by public transportation strikes."

2,"Sep 30, 2007","screw this noise..after riding new york's subway system for only a week, i have determined the residents of san francisco, and the surrounding bay area, are being ripped off by BART officials who are laughing their asses all the way to the bank. this system sucks. trains run on their own schedule. cars usually smell of piss and the rampant homeless in the area. and good luck getting a train when you need it - oh, it'll be here in 18 minutes..the best part of BART today was jumping on a richmond line train and hearing the operator say, ""odelay, que sabe?"" that was seriously the second-best experience i've ever had on BART. outside of that, this thing sucks."
4,"Sep 1, 2007","san francisco is regularly inundated with tourists. this review is for you. oh, and i shouldn't forget the locals who never ride BART except to take the train to baseball games.. this is for you as well.getting around on BART is easy to figure out. it is a train which travels on a rail in one direction and another direction (usually the opposite one) on the other rail. these rails are defined on a color-coded map which should look familiar to anyone from new york, london, chicago, atlanta, or any other city with subways. it's not even as labrynthine as it first appears - there are only four end destinations and five total routes. here's how to read this contraption. first, find your location/station on the map (here's a hint - there are signs absolutely everywhere in the station telling you the answer to this). now, find your destination on the map (no, ""san francisco"" is not a single destination). now comes the part you connect the two. if the line is blue, you'll be catching a dublin/pleasanton train or san francisco/millbrae train depending on which way you'd like to go. transfers are easy to figure out as well with the use of the map, some basic logic, and/or by listening to the train operator - because they announce details like that.ok, so congratulations on picking your route. now, there's a train coming. but where is it going? is it going your way? holy crap! this is where you freak out and ask everyone in the line or doorway, ""does this train go to san francisco!?"" well, all you really had to do was read the large-print, bright red LED signs above you because they tell you exactly where the train's end destination is. also, there's that pre-recorded voice announcing the destination of the train which may confuse some..phew! you are on the train you wanted - you know this because you interrupted two businessmen who were busy doing something important on their laptops. ""now what? there aren't any available seats!"" well, here's your chance to practice your balance - this is always more fun after a night of drinking. i suggest, if you've never ridden BART, to hold on to the disgusting, unsanitized rails above you, or near the door. this ride isn't smooth. now, if you fear you've lost the comfort and security of that map you saw at the station and are now lost in the BART system forever, do not fret. there is one mounted near every door. the fun part here is to stare at it, point, and make observations of what is around each station loud enough so the locals can take notes on this information.general things to know when riding BART:1) the larger seats by the doors are for elderly or disabled people, by law. if you do not give up your seat for an elderly person and you're a young twenty-something, be prepared to be harassed by the liberal denizens of the bay area. hopefully you feel like the jerk you are. also, if you are male, you are required by tightly held codes of honor to give your seat up to any female who may be standing near you. this, however, is not required by law.2) do not hold the doors open if they are closing on you. BART trains already run on some haphazard schedule that no one follows, so don't make it worse. also, these doors are stronger than you'd think and might take your arm off.3) most people are friendly around these parts. they'll answer some questions you may have, or carry on a conversation if they look like the type to talk, but that doesn't mean we want to hear you yelling into your cellphone about how you have been to many restaurants and still not seen the ""san francisco treat"" of rice-a-roni on any menu. we also don't want to hear your ipod.4) bikes are allowed on BART, much to the chagrin of bike-unfriendlies. do not feel bad if you have a bike (within the specifically allocated bike hours, of course). you're just smarter than those who don't.5) i wish the panhandlers would read this because this is where i'd tell them to stop telling us their repetitive sob stories, annoying people for money.6) and, finally, this one deserves capslock.. on the escalators, STAND ON THE RIGHT, WALK ON THE LEFT. it's not written in stone, people, but it's common sense.if you have further questions, or want to study the maps beforehand, refer to http://www.bart.gov. please note that, on 99% of the year, BART stops running around midnight, so plan accordingly."
3,"Oct 18, 2008","It's difficult to accurately rate BART as a whole.  On the one hand, it's a relatively easy, convenient, and quick way to get around particular parts of the Bay Area.  It's also relatively clean, especially when you consider the fact that its seats are cloth and its floors are mostly carpeted.  On the other hand, BART is way too expensive for daily or even regular commuting.  They do offer combination BART-Muni passes and so-called ""high-value"" cards, but I don't consider saving only 6.25 percent a particularly good value, especially when I cannot buy these cards at every BART station.  Also, since you're probably going to have to add some money to use the card a final time, you end up losing some of that measly 6.25 percent.  And I'm not even mentioning the ripoff that is paying $3 extra to get from BART to Oakland International Airport.  (Thanks for making us pay for your poor planning!)In the end, I do like BART.  I mostly use it to get from San Francisco to SFO and to commute to Berkeley when I have seasonal work there.  So for me, BART serves its purpose.  But BART can be pretty annoying to get to if you live in the western part of San Francisco, and the extent of its Bay Area coverage is pretty limited, although I guess they're going through with taking it all the way down to San Jose.Strangely, I find BART the most efficient during rush hour, which I cannot say for Muni or any other major public-transportation system I have used regularly."
1,"Aug 16, 2006","BART deserves no stars:for those who gave it more than one why?let's begin:1) BART is way over-priced; in Chicago i take CTA from ORD to downtown - cost $1.50 - same distance in the Bay Area - at least $5.00+; I pay several thousand of dollars per year to use this system-- in a comparable transit system I would pay just a fraction of that2) Software ""updates"" always have snafu's-- the system shuts down and your stuck for an indeterminate period of time3) BART station agents: usually rude; I am rarely understood even asking the simplest of questions; BART related questions seem to tax them too much4) BART tickets de-mag easily-- if you think about them de-magniticizing they de-magniticize5) BART refunding on de-mag tickets; go to some obscure office open only when you work in downtown Oakland somewhere; and their customer service section at Lake Merritt cannot help with de-mag tickets; they say a de-mag ticket is not a customer service problem??6) I never look at the schedule because i don't think BART ever follows it.7) BART passengers; if I had a dollar for everytime i have been hit in the head while seated I would be quite wealthy hence not taking BART ever agan; somehow it is okay to hit a passenger in the head with a purse, case, backpack etc.  other transit system i have visited -- i have experienced fellow passengers for stepping on your foot or bumping into you--not a BART passenger8) Passengers putting their feet on a seat9) Passengers refusing to move their packs when another passenger wants to sit!  hmmm in other transit systems-- that is called a ticket!10) BART passengers blocking the left side of the escalator11) BART not having signage asking passengers on escalators to move to their left12) BART can only speak in English-- all train signs are ony in English-- yet there is a Thank you sign in many languages-- a bit inconsistent; how about visitors who use the system?13) BART placing stickers on trains saying it won the best transit system in America??? hmmm well given the lack of public transport system-- seems like anyone could win this aware.   and such self-congratulatory messaging -- i am not sure what that does for me or anyone using the system?"

That being said, if you ignore the weirdo's who always seam to sit across from me and want to show off their lack of clothing beneath that newspaper- it is safe and convenient, and who doesn't enjoy a good show? No metering lights, and you can be way over the leagal limit and still get around. My only question is, the bars are open till 2;00, why does Bart stop at midnight? Where's MADD when you need them?"
2,"Jun 6, 2007","FUCK!!! When I moved to the US from Australia, I was forced to start my hate affair with BART.  Sure, it is a less expensive way to get to work than driving but, Christ, it makes me really hate people.  Not a good thing considering I am already challenged in this area. Don't get me wrong, I love my fellow man - I just don't like the stupid, gross, rude, ignorant ones with no sense of personal space. It always amazes me how they just keep pushing, like a herd of sheep trying to get to the food trough, when it's quite obvious that the train is full. I have found a solution to this, however. I dig my little Taurus heels in and I refuse to budge. Sure. Push away. I ain't moving.  So far, it has proved quite effective. I also wait a while for trains. I'd rather wait for 10 minutes than stand next to some weird stranger with a skin disease. It certainly is an education in the awfulness of the human race.I am also SO TIRED of people feeling that's its okay to fart right next to me, sneeze on me or cough on me. If any of you farting, sneezing, coughing types are reading this STOP IT OR I'M GOING TO SEND THE DEMONS OF THE GOETIA AFTER YOU. Seriously. Please acquire some manners. My Mum would be horrified (my mum is very proper) if she heard me on BART. I've taken to yelling at people now (well, yelling as much as my gentle Pig nature will allow me) when they are rude or stupid. Unfortunately, I don't think its working. Sigh. However, I'm stuck without it so I guess I'll  just have to endure. Thank Baphomet for my ipod and a good book."
2,"Jul 9, 2008","Mr Chao thinks BART stands for what happens when you ride on it- ""Bah! Aurgh! Really Tardy!""  Mr Chao thinks the trains on BART are very filthy and old.   Mr Chao has used public transit around the world and has realized that BART, while great in theory, simply is behind the times and doesn't execute public transport nearly as well as other cities/states/countries.  Mr Chao also cannot figure out why the BART doesn't run late at night...so that he can go drinking and get a ride home.

2,"Jan 17, 2011","I've been in a lot of public transit vehicles, and none disappoint me more than that stinky train BART.First, I ride a bike. Oh no!! Look out grouchy old people & easily offended workaholics! I choose to ride a bike, because I do not want to have to take up two seats when I sit down & I think breathing cleaner air is important. I do not ride a bike to be harassed or scowled at while trying to get where I need to. Aren't there kiosks in the BART station asking people to ride their bikes to work more? Hmmm...how would I do that comfortably on your trains BART? CALTrain seems to have a whole train car devoted to their bike riding patrons. Should CALTrain ever dominate your tracks as the Bay Area transportation scheme gets bigger, I will advocate on behalf of my bicycling brothers & sisters to get their model approved for the expansion.Second, clean your cars. I know that BART is an underground housing shelter for the less fortunate...but when it rains, and you have fabric seats, AND carpet(which you are now getting to replacing with non-skid surface - 12 years later), the smell of mold & rot is somewhat unbearable. Why rely on chemical warfare to do the job your trains are already doing? My favorite is a regular commuter I would see, would floss his teeth for the entire 20 minutes he rode - flicking oral debris everywhere. I once saw a group of young men patting hard down on a group of seat cushions, which caused a huge plume of broken-down foam dust(with skin tabs, hair, fart dust, and God knows what else) to be released into the air. Their intent was to cover their friend's food with this dust. So, people eat on BART... When was the last time a citation was given to an eater? I see more drunk people on BART during game season than I do in SF bars!!! Seriously?! Tear down those decals that tell us where a train is serviced...instead have the folks who recycle materials to pull their carts onto BART to remove the waste your union paid workers seem to have a problem doing themselves.Finally, we come to service. I do respect the drivers & technicians you have working your trains. They are courteous, informative, & your backbone. Treat them well, because they are all you have going good for you. You should also treat your station agents better. They are in need of more help, since their attitudes are not always friendly. More help does not mean more people...because lets face it, I've had to wait for some to finish their personal conversations before I see a line go down. Give power back to the rider. Put out more information to them so that the station agent doesn't have to do every little thing. They work hard long days & nights...and some of your patrons on BART are less than well behaved. Your staff at the top have also got to figure out the BART police scenario too. Top execs collect a big enough paycheck, and THAT means you should know how to train your officers to do their job AND review them on a regular basis. There is no reason anyone should die while using your moderate priced transportation.I hope this single opinion shows how I have now come to rely on a bike or a personal vehicle to make my Bay Area travels happen instead of using BART. I hope you integrate changes soon."

3,"Apr 24, 2017","My first time.We took BoltBus from Los Angeles to BART's West Oakland Stn. and from there took BART to Downtown Berkeley to visit UC Berkeley for their Cal Day.For those unfamiliar with BART [Bay Area Rapid Transit] like we were, I have a few tips.From the West Oakland Stn. to their Downtown Berkeley Stn., the actual travel time is about 12 minutes.  However, don't forget to add the waiting time, which varies depending on when you arrive and the metro trains' schedule.   Although BART says in their booklet that they operate from 6 am to midnight, we learned that not all of their lines are operating during this entire time period or every day of the week.  Which meant we had to exit at their MacArthur Stn. to transfer onto another train line to reach our final destination.  This means more time is required for those planning on a tight scheduled.  The BART attendant can assist you if needed.The cost for our particular BART trip was $2 per person/one way.  The fees are posted on the wall near the ticket vending machines.  My wife, daughter, and I all bought our own ticket with $2 cash each.  Each traveler must have their own ticket.  You need these tickets to enter the train's departure platform and also again to exit the arrival platform of your destination, so don't discard or misplace them.  [When you've arrived at your final - paid for - destination, the automated turnstile kept our ticket after it was inserted.]Having exact change to deposit is preferable, but if unable, the machine does dispense change.  The posted instructions could have been written better on this subject, but weren't, which caused frustration and wasted more time trying to figure things out.  On our return trip, our smallest bill was $10.  The machine has a button to press for ""Multiple tickets"" [and then it tries to guess what you need].  It first assumed we wanted 2 tickets and wanted to load $5 per ticket.  Wrong.  So, we had to press another button to tell it we wanted 3 tickets [which the machine then automatically loaded $3.xx per ticket].  Wrong again.  The machine has a button to ""Subtract $1"" and another to ""Subtract 5 cents"".  Neither sum or choice was the correct change for our intended purchase.  With no other obvious option, we pressed the button to ""Cancel"".  After several tries with the same result, we complained to the lone BART attendant in the booth and he came to our rescue.Here's the secret to solve the dilemma.  After telling the machine you wanted more tickets [in our case, a total of 3], to get the correct change, you press the ""Subtract $1"" button to go from auto-loaded $3.30/ticket to $2.30/ticket.  Then, keep pressing the ""Subtract 5 cents"" button until it goes from $2.30/ticket down to $2.00/ticket.  Then, let the machine know you're done and it will return $4.00.  Paper money [$1 bills] were not dispensed as change.  The vending machine returns your change in coins.  [I wasn't looking forward to getting $4 in nickels and was worried when I only heard 4 coins drop.  It turned out to be four rarely used, but well-worn out $1 coins.]The BART system is convenient, but showing its age.  The public restrooms were reportedly gross per my wife and daughter.  Depending on which station you used and the social-economic level of its users and neighborhood, they probably have varying levels of cleanliness.Don't stand too close to the edge of the platform for safety reasons and never turn your back to strangers.  As reported on the news, there are psychos out there that shove unsuspecting patrons onto the tracks.  It may not have happened on BART yet, but it does occur.Be safe, avoid traveling alone if possible, and take care of yourself."

So there is this Orange van that im in love with (no, not the one the creepy guy from your neighborhood used to cruise in) that has a bike trailer, and for a mere buck, will take you from Macarthur to The Greyhound Bus thing in SF. Im actually giving the four stars to Orange Van. There is a drawback, and thats the music. Sorry Reese, but if youre anything like me, bumping gangsta rap at 7am is not on the menu. Well, usually never is, but 7am im not nearly drunk enough to pretend to like it. So bring the phones."
5,"Nov 26, 2012","BART is undoubtedly the sexiest rail transit system on the West Coast.  It is a heavy rail intercity system, so it's significantly faster than light rail systems and features modestly retro sci-fi set-like stations (if you look carefully).  A great thing about riding BART is that you can relax or think about other things without worrying about all the impatient dimwits on the freeways or Bay Bridge.  With the congestion on Bay Area freeways, BART is faster in certain circumstances and can be generally relied upon to always take about the same amount of time.  Personally, I find BART to be a less stressful and hassle-ridden way to get from the East Bay to SF than negotiating the heavily impacted MacArthur Maze.  It's also nice to only have to pay a few bucks for transit fare and not have to hunt for and then lose an arm and leg to parking fees in SF.  Think of it as packing lighter for more freedom of mind.  I find that people complain excessively about the cloth seats and carpet.  Here are some thoughts:1) They aren't that dirty.  Stained?  Yes.  But are you planning on eating dinner or licking the seats?  Do you scrub your gums with them?  If you do so frequently, I'd cut it out because it's against the rules and defies common sense.  Otherwise, they aren't that big of a deal, warmer in fact, than the new vinyl seats they're installing.2) The vinyl seat ""solution.""  Firstly, yes, the vinyl seat covers can be ""cleaned easier"" if needed.  But do you really think that they're going to wipe the seats down every night if nothing has been spilled?  Probably not.  In exchange for a psychological improvement for the thin skinned folks who apparently have imaginary HIV, we get a clammier feeling seat that holds all the scary bacteria closer to the surface than on the cloth seats and a slightly louder interior.3) Regarding the carpet, it is also stained, but again, do you really want to trade a quieter interior for a grimy new linoleum floor?  The carpet may get ugly fast, but for me, a layer of cloth that absorbs some of the budget-cut induced rail screech is preferable to aesthetic ""perfection.""4) For those rude and condescending people complaining about ""bums,"" get a life.  Have they ever heard of the Golden Rule?  Treat others as you want to be treated?  The condescending person might not feel so hot when a different band of people considers that person human trash or something else contemptible.Sigh...Anyway, if you feel like using a fast, modern, and relaxing alternative to dealing with all the congestion on the freeways or the city streets in SF, I'd strongly recommend trying BART."
2,"May 4, 2012","Well, the stations are loaded with assorted 2-legged pigs in S.F.  They sleep there and drop deuces in the common areas.  Dis-gooosting!  The trains are old, crappy and smelly and so are some of the passengers."
1,"Feb 11, 2015","BART is almost always late, whether it be from mechanical issues to the almost daily ""medical emergency"". The BART union has created this mess, diverting money to their overfed bellies rather than focusing on improvements to trains and stations. As a result we have overcrowded, smelly & behind-schedule trains. I can't recall the last time I actually sat down during a commute day (not that I'd actually want to, but at least the seats aren't cloth anymore, YUCK)."
3,"Apr 2, 2013","I have a love/hate relationship with the BART. I commute each weekday from the East Bay into San Francisco and I've experienced a wide range of service from clean & worry free commuting all the way to stinky/dirty & unreliable service.  I've seen people get up and offer their seats to elderly people and I've also seen homeless people passed out lying in their urine and vomit.   I've seen people leave packed cars so that others can get out at stops and also I've seen cyclists jam their way into rush hour packed cars and then block the doors so that people can't get out at their stops.  I've listened to amazing street musicians playing in the downtown stations and purchased their CD's and I've also donated coins to homeless families begging with their children.   I've sat in newly renovated seats and I've also mistakenly sat and put my hand in something left behind by a previous passenger that had not been cleaned.   I've been in trains that were on time, I've been delayed in crowded trains the trans bay tube for up to 40 minutes (unsettling at best).  I've seen posters cheerfully advertising $150,000 in salary for open BART Police job positions and then witnessed the glazed over look in the eyes of BART Police Officers telling me that no salary is worth the price that they pay for their jobs.  At the end of the day I can say that I take BART because it's there and it's a better option for me than driving, however, BART's far from perfect and I wish they would spend more attention to cleanliness, reliability, the riding experience, parking, safety,  and cost."
3,"Jan 8, 2014","With a bicycle, massive quads, and dauntless patience  a car free existence is totally doable in the Bay Area Thanks to BART and other public transit providers.  Pros:--getting to SFO has never been cheaper or easier. The beer can on a rope to OAK is up and running as well... Crappy traffic will not make you miss your flight. --Reasonably punctual. --is cheaper than gas and insurance.--Less stressful than driving or riding--Great place for people watching.--With the introduction of the Clipper card you can get in and our of the station without fussing with the terrible ticket machines or worrying that your card will be demagnetized. A Clipper card is essential to your happiness if you ride BART often.--You always have an excuse to leave the bar. The train stops running around midnight. --Fewer panhandlers than other major citiesCons:-You never can remain at the bar until closing time--No public restrooms in any underground station.  This really stinks literally because our transient community has taken to using stairwells and elevators as toilets instead. It stinks figuratively because you also cannot use the toilet. Your children cannot use the toilet.  It's a major inconvenience. --most of the stations are poorly maintained and filthy--most of the famously well compensated ticket agents are not skilled in customer relations--the maps and signage are outdated and unclear,  even knowing which platform to stand on to catch the right train  is unclear.  It's not tourist friendly."

I rode the subway for 7 years in Boston and nobody ever touched me (on purpose)--compared to most other cities subways (NY, Bos, Chi, DC) it serves only a small area of the city and leaves out a lot of important tourist destinations like the GG bridge --Its really expensive compared to other cities public transit: one-way is $4+ compared to $2 in a lot of other cities.  I guess BART goes farther distance-wise but still--Terribly inconvenient to get to the airport.   Millbrae BART and SFO are literally across the street from each other, but to get from Millbrae station to SFO station on BART you have to take not one but TWO trains!  Ridiculous!  And you have to take a Caltrain to Millbrae if you're in peninsula/south bay.  --You can't get a monthly BART pass, which is really annoying--Its really really noisy compared to other subway systems I've been onI just feel like BART really needs to make up its mind if it wants to be a commuter rail that connects SF to all the surrounding cities, like the East Bay & South Bay or if it wants to be a local subway system for the city of SF.   Right now its a really awkward mixture of both, and it doesn't do either well at all."

If BART was willing to whore itself in other areas of SF like sunset, richmond, pac heights, etc.., then BART would be a more efficient and better suited for the city.

When I finally arrived & got off at SoSF Sta., I tried to use the bathroom but it was locked. It was only 11:30pm, so I asked the Station Attendant why the bathrooms are closed early and whether there are new policies about the bathrooms.  We have used the bathrooms when we come late from the City and so were very surprised that they are now locked.  She told me that BART is a Public Transit System and BART has the option to NOT have the bathrooms available at anytime but if I really have to go she can open the bathroom for me.  I believe the Station Attendant is just LAZY and not following procedures to allow the public access to BART bathrooms.  I don't see any reason why I need to plea to a Station Attendant every time I have to use a bathroom."

1,"Sep 9, 2008","i do everything in my power to limit my interaction with you; and you STILL fail me! i ride during non-commute hours. i get on at the last east bay stop and get off at the first sf stop. shit, i won't even sit on you or hold onto your railings!!! yet, you still amaze me that you lack organization, cleanliness and you're an expensive little B! i will give you that you are cheaper than me driving into sf with bridge tolls, gas and parking but i still don't like you one bit! i get on each time wondering about the foul stench?! then i realize it's the homeless man smelling of urine sitting across from me picking at his flesh and throwing the little pieces on the carpet. i'm also continuously amazed at the people who are comfortable enough to take their shoes off and rub their feet on your bacterial filled carpet. is this a good place to massage or slough the skin from their feet?!?!?! i think not! this is something i see at least once or twice a week! gross right?! i'm still curious who the genius was that thought cloth seats and carpet were a great idea for public transportation? i applaud you for your lack of brain cells and still being able to keep your job! i guess only at bart would you be able to be a complete idiot and still continue to pull in a paycheck. though, i have heard through an inside source, you will be converting to plastic on plastic within the next years. i'll believe it when i see it! you also pretty much suck because you don't really go anywhere at all. your tracks are so limited when you look at the size of the bay and where you actually go. you don't even go into marin county because the citizens there are too stuck up to ruin their aesthetically pleasing cities with public transportation. on my final note, it bothers me that you have the power to make me want to chain smoke an entire pack of marlboro reds! i am counting the days until i will no longer have to partake in the ride under the water!"
2,"May 3, 2008","it's great for getting from place to place, but i recommend you not sit down or touch anything. i have know two people who contracted SCABIES; and the only thing they both had in common was that they took bart every single day to and from work. i think the train gets vacuumed but i'm pretty sure they don't sanitize the seats after a dirty homeless person rides on it. actually, i'm pretty sure those cloth seats have NEVER been sanitized. basically.... SIT DOWN AT YOUR OWN RISK! if you don't know what scabies is, google it and prepare to be disgusted."
3,"Dec 30, 2007","I remember the first time I rode BART.  I lived in Walnut Creek and took the train into the city.  It was around lunchtime and the car was clean and almost empty.  We spent a few hours in town and went home.  Same clean car and we had our choice of seats.  I was amazed.  Then I moved to SF and began to rely on BART every day/night.  The stations became not so clean and the patrons not so sparce (or clean).  I've seen plenty enough to never ride the train again but the only other option is taking MUNI and that's another review.  For the most part BART is on time,  clean enough to stand up in,  and if you mind your own business - safe.  I learned the hard way a FEW TIMES that BART isn'tt open late.  And I have been short a few times and the attendants were cooperative;  not that they would leave their fortresses to chase down a jumper.  The homeless like to camp out in the stations which is fine with me;  better than being out in the cold and I've tossed a few dollars to some of the entertainers there.  The cars get way too crowded during peak times however and more than a few times I've given up my seat for an elderly person only to watch a teenager plop their sorry ass down.  Kudos to the elderly lady one night who confronted two teens when they left their forty oz bottles in the floor when exiting.  Probably a good thing you guys just shut your mouths and got off."
2,"Jan 4, 2017",Just wondering if BART will ever improve service. Either an increase in frequency of arrival or trains with more holding space/seats. I pay on average $9 a day for Bart alone (because downtown SF ticket machines don't accept my transit benefit credit card). I'm sure those commuting to/from Concord pay even more. Why is this service so shitty? Why so many delays or dangerously over crowded trains?
1,"Apr 18, 2010","If we are in any competition with other major condensed metropolitan areas, then our subway system fails and we loose! It's over priced. It's dirty (though I do appreciate that they are changing out the vomit covered carpets for washable flooring). The cool part is that it gets SF folks without cars over to Oakland, Berkeley and Daly City. My #1 complaint though is that it doesn't run 24hrs. UNREAL! What a waste. It's clear to me that BART is purely to make money off people who live way out in the berbs coming to work in SF during the regular 9-5 shifts. They do nothing for SF residents who can only get to a couple of neighborhoods. And they do nothing to keep the people of the bay area safe at night by providing an alternative to drunk driving to and from the east bay. If BART ran 24hrs/day (even at a limited night schedule) I would forgive all other follies. Hey BART, quit building more stations way the hell in the middle of nowhere and run a couple trains on the tracks you have between 12:30am-4am!"
5,"Apr 29, 2008","i heart bart. when i went to college. before i had to drive over the bridge every day, then walk blocks to get to school . when bart opened, i got off at the approximate station and walked a few blocks. of course, that bottle of ripple that helped me walk that distance was missed."
3,"Nov 8, 2015","BART is incredible (for west coast public transportation).  It is very good a certain things - getting you from downtown Oakland to downtown SF and back, getting you to OAK or SFO without spending mad $$$ or getting crippled in traffic, and staying on schedule.  There are many things, however, which need to be fixed, and can be achieved without billions of dollars.  The cars need to have more doors and less seats.  The service needs to be expanded.  Now I'm not saying we need NYC or Chicago style 24-hour service.  All I'm saying is Boston or DC style, run a bit later and start a bit earlier.  Also, I don't get the focus on extending BART deeper into the burbs.  People who live so far away clearly aren't dying for the city life.  Now while I'm all about expansion to the burbs, an easier, and much more needed fix, is infill stations.  You don't have to build new tracks or imminent domain miles and miles of property.  All you have to do is plunk down a few stations between existing ones.  You gotta have 1 in Albany.  You gotta have 1 in Jack London, after West Oakland, but before going underground.  You can have a few more between Lake Merrit and San Leandro.  Having only Fruitvale and Coliseum during that stretch is a joke.  In SF they need a bunch more too.  Step it up BART!"
3,"Aug 20, 2008","You people who line up like you're waiting to use the school's drinking fountain after recess are DORKS! Who cares if you get a seat? You've probably been sitting on your ass all day anyway. And don't tell me to get to the back of the line, either. I've been on several underground systems in the world and no one lines up. I'm not about to start because you think you're somehow entitled to that smelly, upholstered window seat simply because you got there before I did."
2,"May 17, 2008","Unfortunately, I take Bart Monday thru Friday.  And although it is nice to not be in bumper to bumper traffic, the quality of Bart is getting worse.  They prices go up every year, which is fine, but users need to see a significant difference in service and or train(s).  Last Thursday (5/15) I had the most HORRIFIC experience to date, well actually, if you give me some time, I'm sure I could come up with 3 more similar instances.  First of all, I knew there was trouble when I went down to Embarcadero station and the ENTIRE platform was flooded with people.  Also, there was a Fremont train with all doors open, and people packed to the brim, with others standing outside realizing they have to wait until another train comes their way.  I KNEW I had to just get out of the station.  It was about 5:15pm, and I boarded the on coming Dublin/Pleasanton train....it was FOUR CARS!!  WTF!!!  So again, everyone packed it in like sardines (with leaving people on the platform that couldn't fit).  The train went TURTLE SLOW.  Realizing that every platform was pouring with people, I off boarded at Bayfair Station to catch a Fremont train.  Again, the platform was FULL.  You would think that a breeze through the station would easily push 5-10 people to their death - or maybe they would be considered lucky for they would no longer be on the platform with 1,000 people.  I boarded the Fremont train, and as the train got to South Hayward, the operator said that someone had FAINTED on the train.  There would be another Fremont train coming on the other side of the platform and gave the riders 2 minutes to DART out of the train RUN ACROSS to the other side of the platform and BOARD ANOTHER TRAIN.  WTF?!?!  It was such a PATHETIC commute that there were even people clapping as we reached the Fremont Station.  I bet they were clapping for 3 reasons: 1. Couldn't believe they made it to their destination; 2. Couldn't believe they didn't need to TRANSFER to yet ANOTHER train; and3. They probably don't ride Bart on a regular basis and wanted to ""rub it in"" to those of us that do.As a consumer, when you are not satisfied with a service, in good faith the service provider gives you a DISCOUNT or REFUND for the awful service.  It just boggles my mind, especially when I travel internationally and experience the AMAZING metro transit rail system in other countries (timely, CLEAN, pleasant)....Bart is pretty below standard."

Went back for a high school reunion and saved $200 on my plane ticket by flying into Oakland, so I gladly sprang the $3.59 for BART. It was a very convenient connection both ways, and I'd definitely do it again."
4,"Jun 12, 2005","as a daily BART commuter i certainly have a lot of opinions about it.  it certainly does the job getting me back and forth from my apartment in the city to my job in berkeley and for that it is to be commended.  its existence prevents me the ugly necessity of owning a car.  i have also taken it to both SFO and OAK many times which certainly saves me money while costing me some time (but since i have more time than money its a good deal).  i have visited every single BART station and they are for the most part extremely clean and some of them are pretty cool looking as well.  if you like, head on over to http://cryoem.berkeley.edu/~egalburt/bart.htm to navigate vBART and check out my pics of each station.     while people complain about service, i think that more people need to use BART in order for it to make sense to add more trains.  however, they do seem to continually raise prices while the amount of service continues to decline... lastly, although probably too late to change unless we want even more price hikes, the choice to use cloth seats and flooring is a mysterious one at best.     anyway, congratulations to BART for being america's number one transit system...whatever the f that means."

1,"Aug 25, 2008","Like Sarina mentioned, the BART is way more efficient over the muni. Great way of getting from place to place. The other stations were fine but this particular station, it ruined my experience. One of the employees at the information window disrespected me from the get go. I put money on one of my Bart Cards that i had previously used. I used my debit card and got my receipt. My gf was like you dont need the receipt right and tossed it away. I found no harm in that. So i tried to get through and it gave me an error after a few tries. So i went to the window and i didn't even say a word and she gave me attitude right from the get go.

4,"Jan 11, 2008","I absolutely LOVE taking BART places. I have no clue why. There's just interesting people on there, no traffic lights and usually when I'm on it's not crowded. But it is soooo dirty and rundown. I wish they'd fix it up. But I can appreciate it still."

2,"Aug 16, 2012","I'm a BART rider on occasion but have used it through the years...To be honest, the system has expanded but has just gotten worse each year as ridership increases. The trains are ALWAYS packed during rush hour (solution: more trains!) The trains are FILTHY (solution: go for NY's subway option, use plastic or whatever the material they use for seats instead). For SF State to do a study on the germs, fecal bacteria and skin borne diseases found in the chairs BART could use the increase in fare to revamp the interiors. It's expensive - from Dublin to Montgomery you're looking at $11.30 round trip; that's $56.50 per week. $226/month, or 2700+ per year! To top it off, most stations that offer parking charge for parking in their lots. It's constantly HOT in train and train stations.The good things: it gets you from point A to point B (eventually) and it covers a fair amount of the bay area --- well that is if you don't count the Santa Clara/San Jose South Bay part of the Bay Area. They accept Clipper which is convenient."

With your new price increases it costs me more to go the the airport than to go down to San Jose via Caltrain.  Looks like now when I go to fly out of town I will spring the extra couple bucks and take a shuttle.  Sorry Bart...I think you lost a rider."
4,"Feb 2, 2009",Bart...I like you when I have to take you.  I definetly like you more in the city and south.  You get a little too confusing/annoying in the eastbay.  Great for the airport though.  Prices seem fair and I've never not felt safe.
3,"Jun 11, 2009","Ever since I left my job in San Francisco and started working in the East Bay, BART has been my way of getting to work. I've gotten used getting there and having the train be pretty on time. It really doesn't lie about times except maybe by a minute or two. I just don't like it when they leave just as you arrive at the door and there's nothing you can do except watch the train go by and wait another 15 minutes during the commute hours. What I am not a fan of is/are people getting on to the train and pleading their sad story/sob story. I've been on a train where there was a regular asking for money for medication. They don't have enough for the month, etc. Then they get a phone call and break out their cell phone. Yeah right they're on a fixed income etc.The other was recently where a guy got on and said, ""Can anyone spart $6.00 so I can get a breakfast meal at Burgar King?"" OK, $6.00 for a breakfast? Where does he think he is? So this lady gives him $1.00 so he needs five more. He then goes to the other end of the train pleading for $6.00. HELLO!? If you asked if anyone could spare some change and or $1.00 you're more likely to get that then the $6.00 you're asking for. Damn, if you're going to pan-handle on the damn trains at least ask for a reasonable amount. Geez. You're not bright and obviously if you're asking for $6.00 it's probably for beer or something. My other gripe is when there's someone REALLY REALLY smelly on the train. OMG! The whole car REEKS of that guy! Can someone please do something about that?Since BART has taken out some of the carpeting in cars it's been more pleasant to ride. The new floors are less likely to smell like urine which is a big plus. Now if they could only change their seats to something other than cloth...When a car had no air going in and is boiling hot and there's a person that smells that's when I have to change cars. I'm sorry, but a warm car with a smell is enough to make me sick. If it's just warm I can fall right asleep. Except when there's some guy that stands right next to me as I'm trying to sleep asking for money.Don't scare me while I'm about to sleep. And please don't stand next to me if you smell. BART is a nice transportation to get me to and from, but all other bus systems need to learn from MUNI. MUNI is still better than AC Transit any day of the week."
2,"Jan 2, 2019","Started with a New Years 2019 BART trip to San Francisco from the Eastbay, not a disappointment.  The trains had plenty of available seats, after all it was before noon and many people were home recovering from their celebrations of the night before.  The train was of course with the usual suspects; one sleeping passenger on a seat looking like he had been there for several hours; another passenger with no shirt walking down the aisle with his pants literally falling down and he clearly had wet himself (just what I wanted to see); then the one goon who played his rap music so everyone in the car could listen to the m..f.. lyrics that are so welcome by all; and then the jerks that come onto the train sizing-up the other passengers and try to look threatening just standing there never taking a seat. Getting off at the Civic Center Station presented several misfits who were going-up to those waiting asking for a dollar.  They clearly were there to pander and annoy paying passengers.  How did they get down to the platform, they for sure didn't pay to get through the gates. Would have been nice to see a uniformed BART officer attending to some business along the way, but again never saw one. I know they are pressed, but really they could go through these areas frequently and make a positive difference.  The kiosk attendants should be monitoring the cameras on the platform and get security there and perhaps fewer of these misfits would be hanging around harassing paying passengers.  Just a few thoughts, beware as you travel the rails on BART."

Only reason they lost a star is because they shut down at midnight with the last train running at like 12:50.

1,"Aug 29, 2011","BART, as a subway, is well-designed. BART, as an organization, is bureaucratic, officious, and utterly unaccountable to anyone.BART police: 206 BART police officers. Three fatal shootings in three years.NYC Transit Police: 2,400 officers, no fatal shootings in the last ten years.Caltrain: 6 officers. No fatal shootings, ever.Why does BART need such a huge, aggressive police presence... and their own SWAT team, armed with automatic rifles? Do they intend to use those rifles on a crowded platform, or inside of trains?They have more officers per rider than NYC, by a large margin... which means that an average rider pays about 50 cents more each way to pay for salaries, training, etc. They were designed to be a completely automated transit system, with cars arriving every two minutes... instead, they are a huge, self-perpetuating bureaucracy. Willie Brown was right... they're transit police. They should have tasers, not guns."

Cloth seats, screaching metal on metal sounds between the stops in the mission, not the fastest, definitely not the cheapest (don't get me started on this one...my rating will most certainly start going down), not the cleanest, not the most comprehensive in terms of stops and coverage, but all in all, you will get to your destination....eventually. And hey, you can go under the bay. How cool is that? It's pretty damn cool.But what the hell is up with the tickets? I had a bunch of old tickets with 30-75 cents, ALL of which had been ""unreadable"". What the hell? Then I read some signs in the box window which directed against placing the tickets near cell phones or credit cards or change. Um, either someone here is way ahead in their technology. Or behind. I'm guessing it's the latter. And for how much money is actually going on those tickets to travel just a couple of miles, by now they should be equipped with a chip that allows us to connect to the internet so we can surf the web or they should act as xray vision goggles or they should be able to self destruct in 5 seconds like this review should have done 100 words ago."

How if you are stranded in the transbay tunnel, or in the subway, you should cross through to the adjacent tunnel to await the rescue train?

And just in case they do come, don't run down the MIDDLE of the tracks.As I hurtle through the subway with that unmistakable BART sound screeching in my ears, with a train full of perfect strangers, my mind starts racing about the situations that would cause such an evacuation; and of course, I think about some kind of tremendously powerful and horrifyingly destructive earthquake that shakes the living shit out of everything, and destabilizes the transbay tube...of course, it would happen on the day I finally overcome agoraphobia, and decide to check out downtown Oakland....how freaky it would be to climb out of the train in the tunnel, as it begins to leak....pitch blackness, as the lights have failed, and all of us passengers trying to light the way with cellphones and iPods...the cities of Oakland and San Francisco engulfed in turmoil, death, and destruction...fires erupting everywhere from all the gas lines in all the cities around the bay....we would SO be on our own.....the illustration gives me the chills.But I digress...There is no excuse to shut down BART service at midnight or one AM...that's just silly and embarrassing.

The irony of BART is that it encourages driving, i.e. cars are good, BART bad.Case in point: - It is not possible to get to SFO on a Sunday/Holiday before 9:05AM via BART, which runs $8+ dollars one-way from most San Francisco stops.- However, it IS possible to get to SFO from Millbrae by 8:07AM. ($4.05 one-way fare)Do people not go to the airport on Sunday mornings? Is BART trying to divert people to park in the shiny Millbrae parking structure?

2,"Feb 25, 2016","My biggest complaints with BART are: inconsistency, safety and it's just plain dirty.  While I understand a public transit agency cannot stop anyone from using the system, it doesn't feel safe, especially if you are using it during non-commute times.  There are a lot of homeless and crazies that move from car to car and train to train.  I saw a man sitting in a seat who was accosted by a crazy walking through the train.  BART does nothing (and I mean NOTHING) to make patrons feel safe; they have dummy security cameras in the majority of their cars!  BART has a ""schedule-smedule"" attitude; they don't run on time, are frequently 20+ minutes delayed and don't apologize.  The trains are pretty filthy; I don't know if they are ever cleaned.  BART also holds the entire Bay Area hostage every 3-4 years when the train operators union contract is being negotiated. During the last strike, I had to use AC Transit; the commute experience was radically different and I crossed over the to the Light Side.  Now, I only take BART when I have to (which fortunately is not very often).  Other major cities have larger systems and fewer problems.  Also, get rid of those ridiculous paper tickets that are useless if a drop of water touches them."

3,"Aug 23, 2008",The BART is very efficient compared to the MUNI in my opinion. I like how it spreads out of SF into various areas far east and south. If only the BART ran more inside of SF like how the subways are in NYC. I would be in heaven!
2,"Nov 18, 2008","Public transportation has always been a part of my life.  It was always there.  It was there in Boston where I would ride the MBTA to class.  (Now the Charlie Car, I believe, excuse me if I am wrong I moved away in '04)  It was there when the MTA was the nexus of my transportation in NYC.  I ride the BART almost everyday for work, from Daly City to 16th st Mission.  What do you mean Daly City isn't part of SF?  It is here I moved unknowingly on a whim, regardless of the consequences (thankfully the lease is up in a month), and was aghast to find that there is NO MONTHLY BENEFIT FROM RIDING PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION.  I mean seriously, what the fuck?  (Oh wait there is, but unfortunately it starts at Glen Park.... Thanks!)Nobody, wants to ride public transportation, they do it because they have to.  BART is by far the most expensive public transportation I have come across out of these three major cities I have called my home.  The only benefit it has is its schedule because you can count on a train arriving when its  expected.I'd be much more pro BART if it seemed like they did anything for their customers."
3,"Jan 3, 2008","ugh the bart. i don't like the bart. it was very confusing to me for a while, especially transferring stations.I like Caltrain. Caltrain is good. Very easy to use.Good thing about the Bart is that it takes you closer  to your destination and many other places the Caltrain won't take you to.The wait isn't totally long but it can be really annoying."
2,"Oct 12, 2008","Context is everything.  New York blows BART out of the water.  BART runs too infrequently, has a cut off time, is dirty, and doesn't run to many of the places I'd like to frequent.  You NEED noise cancelling head phones when riding that thing....or some Zanex for the shrilling sounds BART makes on the tracks."
3,"May 5, 2008","Compared to nothing, it's functional.  Compared to anything, in any other western country, pure crap.  It's runs.  It keeps you out of traffic..but it is a dirty, loud, out dated, and sub-par transportation system.  Please, Bay Area, give public transport a good name again."
4,"Aug 16, 2007","BART is probably the most convenient way to Go to San Francico and around the Bay Area. Its inexpensive and reliable, two good things you want in public transportation! One of the better transit systems, a nice smooth ride."
5,"Mar 12, 2008","Anywhere you can't go on BART is probably not worth going to. It is absolutely the best, most efficient way to get around the Bay Area. And the coolest thing? Spare the Air days. Second coolest thing? The caliber of people you meet on it."
5,"Jul 5, 2009","BART. I love BART. I wish Denver had BART. BART makes it easy to get around the Bay Area without the need to drive and sit in traffic. The system is old and can use some updated trains, but they are in good shape and seem to run well enough and get by OK. The station attendants are helpful and can direct you should you have a question or get lost. BART got me from the airport to my hotel downtown and even out to the A's/Rockies games in Oakland. What can I say bad about BART?  Nothing. I wish it were as easy here in Denver. I miss you BART."
5,"Mar 4, 2012",Fast and good services... its Bart even a teenage knows how to use it
2,"Nov 17, 2014","BART seriously needs to announce the stops on its way, instead of forcing passengers to crane their necks in a packed train to look for the tiny station signs which are not always outside each train car, or else miss the stop.  Service in this respect is obviously subpar when you think of all the other subways in the major cities around the world, like London, Tokyo, Beijing and Hong Kong.  Unless, of course, BART management stops to care anymore."
2,"Sep 30, 2007","yesterday was love-fest in san francisco so the bart back to berkeley was full of happy costumed kids....girl with pink everywhere: ""oh my god i know what we should do! i have this new wave dance mix and i know everyone on this train knows all the words and we should totally do karaoke!""then, wait for it.... they start singing in the most amazingly off-key voices half the words to the songs we used to skate to at the roller rink."
4,"Aug 3, 2008","bart is my public (sometimes 10-car) limousine into the city.i take bart to/from work when i miss my bus. i'm comparing the bart to ac transit. of course i'm going to give it a good review. i have to admit, however, that it gets a tad pricey in the long-term. it beats gas/parking/toll though, right?"
2,"Aug 3, 2009","NYC fare is 2.25$ enough saidBART is too expensive, Fremont to Powell is 5.60$, 5.60$/pp (!)It's not that I can't afford it, sure easy. It's my belief that public transit needs to be cost competitive to driving into the city. Our genius city planners made it such that we need a car anyway (and pay for its maintenance),"
2,"Oct 23, 2007","All right, I have to agree with the wisdom of the crowds and say that BART can be quite odoriferous and unclean. And half the time the odor comes from fellow travelers. If I wanted to ride with homeless folks, I'd have stayed in SF and ride MUNI. It's not as bad as the NYC subway back in the 80s, but how much is that saying really? I use it everyday to get to work. It's convenient, and generally punctual, but after years of dealing with mysteriously disappearing MUNI buses, I think my public transit standards are at an all time low. Every major US city I've been too has been in the process of upgrading their train cars, except it seems, BART. Despite the fact that it's ridiculously expensive to use and is only open til about midnight, even on weekends."
2,"Jan 22, 2008","I could write a manifesto about BART, as I have been riding it since 1983. The ultimate love/hate relationship. BART is like that talented soul who can't maximize their potential.In a nutshell...BART is perfect for transporting suburban commuters to Downtown SF. It falls far short of perfection for transporting people all throughout the Bay Area. I used to think BART was great. then I took the subways in Stockholm. Greatest public transit on earth. Missed a train at 1am and there was another in 5 MINUTES! The Swedes know what serving the public is about. Barcelona has better subway service than BART. Amsterdam, Lisbon, Vancouver...Do BART officials ever take notes from other major cities? Oh I forgot, in America we don't fund shit, so I can't blame BART officials. When will BART stop using cloth covered seats? All kinds of who knows what is soiled in these seats. If you don't live near BART, it's a pain. to get there. By the time you drive/bike to the station, you might as well have driven/biked to your destination. Fares are always going up with mediocre service. How many times are you stuck and they don't tell you what the delay is about? In BART's defense, they don't have the advantage of developing with the growth of the metropolis. California was built around cars, and BART had to fit in. Why oh why didn't the good people of San Mateo county vote to have BART service back in the late 1960's? I'm seriously babbling..."
5,"Feb 8, 2009","I pretty much like BART . It's very convenient , reliable , and almost always on time . I go to City College so BART is nice for me . I can get from downtown to school or from school to downtown in around 15 minutes . Much faster than the Metro or the bus . It's also nice how I can use my monthly Adult Muni Fast Pass to take BART to school everyday for no additional cost . I just HATE how the fastpass is a magnet . What does this mean ? Don't get them close to phones or anything magnetic . If you do , they get ""magnetized"" as the BART people say it and it won't go through the gate . Then they will right a number on the back of your fastpass and you will have to start flashing it to the BART people ( which is really annoying ) instead of sliding it through the gate and you will need to get it exchanged before that day somewhere near Powell Station ."
4,"Jul 5, 2006","So I have only been living in the area for about a month and I can't tell you how great it is to have a mass transit system that is convenient...unlike LA.  I am originally from Chicago, so to have this convenient transit system is wonderful.  Get to SFO on $5...I'm there."
3,"May 28, 2008",It is a necessary evil I tell you. Usually smells like urine and full of freaks. It is just preparing you for the stench of walking out of the civic center bart station. I usually have no probs as long as I have the &$@k off look on my face. But even with the smell and the freaks - it beats sitting in traffic!
5,"Mar 2, 2008","I remember when the Hayward BART station opened up. I was a kid and they had this big parade and everything. I remember them saying that BART would eventually be free. Hasn't happened yet but I still love the system. High speed rail traveling at 70 mph, gets you where you want to go without being stuck in traffic-and much safer than driving a car. When was the last time a BART train hit a car or another BART train, or anything for that matter?Large comfortable roomy trains-much bigger than the green blue and gold lines in LA, running about every 15 minutes for most of the day take you to most places in the bay area except San Jose. Whenever i fly into the bay area I won't rent a car. Between, bart, a bike, a bus, and a rare taxi ride I can go just about wherever I want. I particularly like going to the oakland airport on BART. Going from Castro Valley to Oakland, when you drive you have to take 880. And the interchange getting you onto 880 is almost always backed up-but never when you ride bart."
4,"Nov 3, 2011",Bart is great only down fall is the seat cushions are filthy and it doesn't run 24 hours
5,"Jan 12, 2011","I think we are spoiled rotten in the Bay Area by our transportation systems. Looking around the world at other transit operations reveals that we are extremely lucky with what we have. BART is incredibly well run and operated. Think about this: In the midst of a huge economic recession, BART was one of the few government agencies to actually have a surplus at the end of 2009. Do you know how big MUNI's deficit is? Yes, the trains can be crowded during rush hour, but name one transit system in the world that doesn't get crowded during rush hour.Yes, there are delays occasionally when some fucking retarded homeless drunk falls on the tracks, but that's hardly BART's fault.And fare costs? Again, looking worldwide, BART is actually astonishingly cheap."
2,"Oct 15, 2010",Their upholstered seats are disgusting.  I know that replacing them all with plastic chairs would be expensive-- but at least plastic can be hosed down occasionally.
4,"Sep 5, 2009","ok bart, i'm just sayin you could be a little cheaper, i know you're convenient and all but you're just a bit too expensive for me to bother going to the city as much as i want to"
4,"Jul 4, 2009","Visitors need only a few things when it comes to public transportation: trains need to go where you want to, the fares need to be reasonably priced, the maps have to be easy to use, and the trains need to be clean. BART delivers each time I visit San Francisco. Last week, I took BART from Market to Concord, and all these needs were met. The eagle landed safely."
4,"Jan 13, 2010","Stepping onto a BART train is like stepping into a time capsule.  The train interiors have not been updated for as long as I can remember.  The seat cushions are beyond well-worn, to the point that they are just saggy and practically pointless.  Sometimes the screeching along the rails suggests that the BART is a disaster in the making.  However, after riding on the BART for over 10 years, it is simply the best mode of transportation around the Bay Area, specifically San Francisco.  The trains are frequent and often on time.  They have a station located at SFO, with the fare to Downtown SF only being $8.10 - which is a hell of a lot cheaper than a $40 cab ride."

2,"Jul 20, 2006","not too happy because the seats in the train cars can get cleaned up a bit more if not replaced.  i hate the fabric lining that they have..it should be plastic - more sanitary.  carry a liquid hand sanitizer.maybe i'll up the stars on bart if they extend service in various hot spots in the southbay.  i just want it to grow all over the bay area like how MTA is accessible all over nyc....if that happens, i'd gladly sacrifice my car."
4,"Nov 20, 2008","I found the BART to be nicer than the MARTA in Atlanta, and more accessible and easier to use than the metro in D.C. (and quite possibly nicer). It is certainly easier to use than the non unified public transport composed mostly of just bus lines that we have here in the NOLA metro area."
4,"Dec 6, 2010","for somebody who grew up and lived in Los Angeles their whole life like me, this type of convenient public transportation that covers most of the geographic regions of a city like San Francisco can easily strike a chord of travel envy.  it took me some time to figure out on my own how the different lines, stops, and pricing worked, but once i did, i totally want one of these for my own!yes, the ride between West Oakland and Embarcadero can get kinda bumpy and really loud.  yes, some of the stains on the seats and unpleasant aromas that follow around certain people can be unappetizing and suspect.  but other than having my legs get used to more walking around the city than i am typically accustomed to, i really didn't have much of a desire to drive my own car at all during my stay in the Bay Area, especially whenever i saw parking restrictions everywhere with the endless parking fee requirements.  some say that the BART + MUNI fees can get pricey, but as far as i'm concerned, i think i saved money!"
2,"Apr 25, 2007","It's quick and effficent on the weekend. But on the weekday, it'll be like Hollister, Southwest(or Cathay Pacific/Singapore Airlines/United in Economy), and CalTrain rolled into one. Chaotic, just like stepping into Hollister on a Saturday afternoon when it's packed with soccer moms and teeny boppers. Packed, like a Southwest flight from LA/OC to OAK. And it's almost like CalTrain. The electronic fare equipment has hiccups all the time. When is BART going to use TransLink? It's a great way to get to San Francisco Center or the Coliseum/Oakland Arena or Berkeley, but for getting into the City during commute hours, I advise you to use AC Transit, WestCAT Lynx or the ferry."
4,"Sep 10, 2007","happy 35th bday to bart!  (always nice to find someone/something older than me)i've been riding bart for 15 years now, from commuting to cal to the present daily work grind, and occasional ventures into the city for sports or scout events.  (plus all the union square shopping excursions w/ mom growing up!)  i've seen the transformation of train cars from the dingy brown seats to the ""newer"" teal seats and the opening of new stations down the peninsula.  i've survived one bart strike and have yet to make an emergency exit and traverse the underground tunnels *knocks on wood*yes, some seats are grimier and smellier than others, and other cars desperately need air conditioning.  there are a few uh, ""interesting"", passengers every now and then, but aside from loud ranting and rumbling, requests from spare change, and bit of indecent exposure, no harmful or malicious intent.  there are also rude passengers who don't seem to understand the concept of a line or why it's gross to clip their fingernails in public.  and yes, there is the occasional delay.but all in all, bart has been a reliable and dependable part of my life.  no need to deal with traffic or parking issues (well, aside from the increasingly crowded parking situation at daly city).  it's a quick 20-minute ride to and from work, during which i can catch up on some work, reading, or zzzs, or play some poker or pokemon games, or even do some people-watching.  i'd much rather hop on bart than deal with muni!in celebration of the 35th anniversary, bart officials are looking forward to a future of further improvements.  a few requests:- please PLEASE add more parking @ daly city- please have more trains run further down the peninsula- please have station agents announce which trains are scheduled to leave first - i know the order (pt/bay point, fremont, richmond, dublin) and it throws me off when they depart daly city in the wrong order!as long as i have to trek to the fidi for work, i'll be commuting on bart =)  i've even used it as a verb (e.g., ""are you gonna bart it downtown?"" it happened w/ tivo & google, no?)"
1,"Jan 8, 2009","It s intensly socially IRRESPONSIBLE for the bart to close before bar time.  so basically if you want to come into the city to drink you have to drive. yeah, thats a good idea. SERIOUSLY?? unsafe. come on."
4,"Sep 16, 2007","5 stars for my train arriving on time almost every single day - both directions, 5 stars for getting me out of the car, 5 stars for letting me avoid the bridge, 5 stars for whisking me 19 miles in 24 minutes during rush hour from San Leandro to SF Montgomery.  3 stars for less than clean stations and trains, 2 stars for station agents, I have no clue what they do = 4 star overall.  I am so lucky to have BART as an option.  The freeways and ""that bridge"" at rush hour are a NO star experience."
4,"Feb 9, 2006","I love bart. I am not really to worried on what I sit my ass on so long as it's dried and I am oblivious. I would be more concerned with other dirty spots we are exposed to daily. Also, on a weekend or mid day.. bart is quiet and the seats are huge and it is the goddamn perfect spot to study or read. I could sit on it for hours with the ipod. I realize that most people bitch about the cost and, yeah it does suck it doesn't run past midnight, but for how fast and accessible it is to the towns surrounding sf I would gladly hunker down 5 bones to avoid the traffic and shitty drivers any day."

5,"Feb 10, 2009","I love BART!, it's the best public transit system we have in the bay area, I love it even though it's nowhere near as great as the NYC subway which is by far the best public transit system I have ever used. I always use BART whenever I go to the city and the east bay, it drops you off right in front of the Oakland Coliseum and the Oakland Arena since they are next to each other so it's best to take it whenever you go to events there instead of driving and you're better off taking BART to the city too instead of driving since taking BART is a lot less headaches, I always take it whenever I go to watch my A's play,. I just can't wait until they bring it to San Jose so I don't have to drive 40 mins or so from my house in San Jose to get to the Fremont station but wer'e years away from that happening but I still love BART!"
1,"Jul 4, 2009","OMG - I've never had a great experience using this system. OK - the prices are very high to the point of almost discouraging using public transit but I suck it up. But what's with the no food and drink rule? How is one supposed to commute with this restriction? And how hypocritical of the city of San Fran. They let people sleep, urinate and do drugs in the streets of Market Square but don't let you drink bottled water or coffee on their public transit system.  Huh?  Also, whenever I do have a problem or question the BART staff is about as rude as rude can be. Where do they find these people? Probably off the street of Market Square."
2,"May 22, 2007","Please. Of all the transportation systems for major metropolitan areas in the United States BART certainly has the nicest chairs but must be one of the most inefficient systems. Where to start? Ok, the chairs. They're nice. The trains are really nice,  but this isn't the 1930's and I don't expect someone to come by and take my drink order while I relax and read the evening paper. I just want an easy, cheap way to get home where I don't have to worry about getting attacked by some crazy person or be delayed because of some punk-ass kids starting fights. The train conductors may or may not be morons, that is still up for debate. The station agents are indeed morons and there is no room for doubt there. I can't recall if I've met a meaner or sketchier group except for Hut people (not you Rajie!) than BART station agents. I've fallen asleep many-a-time on BART and getting back home is never easy because the trains stop running way too early. I'll never for the life of me understand BART's excuse as to why they stop running trains so early which is ""Maintenance"". Maybe you're just lazy and not very well managed. Because of this, countless people are put-out when trying to enjoy themselves. I can't tell you how many nights I had to end early because of BART. BART is like a demanding, possesive person who knows that you need them to take you to things and help you get around but holds it against you and controls you and always ruins your night because you need to eventually get home but you're on BART's schedule and BART is like the only person in the world who matters. BART has a huge ego.  Despite all this, I take this train at least 10 times a week because I work in the city and live in a land where Oaks grow and don't feel like driving. Call me a complainer, but BART is way behind on where it should be. Let 'em strike, let 'em eat cake for all I care. Just try and use bigger trains and run a little later into the night. Egomaniac!"
1,"Jul 31, 2009","Sorry BART but in my experiences with you, you failed miserably.  I'm not even going to compare you to other transit systems in the world because then you'd look even worse.  Your employees are morons, your security sucks, your system with it's easily demagnetized cards is inefficient, and, really, you don't go very many places and where you do go is expensive.  Take this instance for example:I purchased two rides, one for leaving SFO and for one returning.  Aside from the bizarre machine that only allowed me to select an amount in $.05 increments [do you know how long that took to reach $10+?], the one leaving worked fine.  Coming back was the problem.  The card was safely stowed in my wallet, nothing touched or altered the magnetic strip, yet it would not work when I tried to swipe it through and told me to see an attendant.  My friend was already through and waiting for me.  Of course there was no one inside the two glass booths so I used the help phone on the wall and was told I needed to walk all the way on the other side of the station.  It was not a short distance and I was annoyed but off I went, leaving my friend behind.  I was met by three people all stuffed into one booth, talking and laughing with each other - why the hell weren't any of these people in either of the booths on the other side of the station?  The only one who seemed willing to bear with the inconvenience of helping me took my card with a grunt after I explained what happened, gave it back to me along with a dime [to this day I still have no idea why], said nothing to me and I walked back to other side of the station to go through the machine where my friend was standing.Again, it wouldn't go through.So I again walked all the way back to the other side and the woman said to me in a snotty tone, ""Uh, because you have to swipe it there"" and she pointed to the machines directly next to her booth.  Well, gee, wouldn't it have been nice if you said that to me before?  Not everyone is aware of BART's odd transit rituals.  When someone hands you a transit card, most people would assume you can use it in any of the machines in the station.So now I had to walk all the way back to the other side just so I could tell my friend I was going to walk all the way back to where I just was and I would meet her on the platform.  The cell phones did not work underground, obviously.  I spent 20 minutes walking back and forth across that damn station.  Then we somehow lost each other between the upstairs/downstairs but that's a whole other story.Oh and the scammers who stand by the machines and try to get you to buy their cards instead of your own - wow, way more aggressive than the people who do it in NYC.  This guy looked like an indie band hipster dropout and I had to tell him five times to leave me alone.  He [and others] were also all in full view of BART employees and of course none of them ever came over to question why these people were milling around the ticket machines all day long.  Way to go, BART workers!"
5,"Jan 7, 2013","I take BART everyday from Oakland into SF. It makes my life so easy!!! The ride is less than 15 minutes and it is ALWAYS ontiem to the minute. The train comes every 7-15 minutes so I don't worry if I miss one. Every morning the cars are packed and it does not bother me at all. (it is like 10 degrees hotter in the train though than outside so take your coat off). When I ride it for other purposes than to get to work it is still a time and money saver. And sometimes there is free ""entertainment""."
1,"Sep 2, 2015","Bart is very poorly run.  The attendant at the Millbrae station was not at his post on a busy Wednesday morning.  I stood around waiting for a few minutes and realized later he was chatting with another staff at the far end of the station.  The parking payment system is so old, both machines and process.  After few tries at paying for parking at one of the machine did I realized that the machine is cash only, and the coin slot does not work, and it won't make change.  There was no way to use this machine to pay for 2.50 parking fare.  I don't know why there wasn't a sign to tell people to not waste their time."

2,"Sep 26, 2010","So, I finally made my first trip to San Francisco last weekend. It was supposed to be a quick weekend trip in & out of town. I agree w/ previous posts that ticket dispensers are fairly confusing & make you feel rushed getting through the gates & down the escalators/stairs so you won't miss your train. Arriving via SFO to the BART station onsite was relatively painless.The pain started in my ears as I sat right next to a door, sitting sideways for my ride to Downtown SF. The nearly deafening screaming sounds the BART made going in & out of the tunnels on the yellow line bound for Pittsburg Point made deciphering what the train conductor was saying as we pulled into each stop very difficult. The cars inside look old & the carpeting does nothing to change that appearance. (Can you imagine the germs riding along w/ you in the chairs & that nasty carpeting?) The seats were surprisingly comfortable - which had to be the best part of the entire ride. After hearing the noise for more than a 1/2hr as we got to the Montgomery Street stop. My ears were ringing for the remainder of the evening & falling asleep was very difficult as my ears just kept on ringing. Next time, I'll make sure to wear ear plugs when I hop on.The worst part of the ride was when I asked for directions to the street where my hotel was located. It was tough to find a BART worker anywhere in the station at around 10:45 in the evening. The worker I found pointed me in the exact opposite direction of where I needed to go, so I roamed around a cold, wet, & foggy Downtown SF for nearly 2 hrs until I finally came to my hotel. (I asked a total of 5 individuals where 3rd Street was & finally had to purchase a street map in a nearby 7Eleven b/c I was completely unfamiliar w/ my location). I was extremely unhappy that (aside from NOBODY in SF being able to give directions  - apparently that isn't being taught in schools anymore) the one person who should've pointed me in the right direction, simply wasted my time, energy, & left me feeling pretty helpless for a time. Certainly NOT a good way to start what was supposed to be a relaxing weekend in a brand new city.I'd rate the BART customer service at their stations very poor. I'd rate the ride itself OK as it did get me there safely w/o breaking down or me having to drive a VERY tricky Downtown SF street grid late at night esp. since it was so foggy that night. The trains rock back & forth - sometimes very violently - but it is cheaper than a cab ride from the SF Int'l Airport.I was actually resolute enough to brave a return trip back to SFO at the completion of my less than 48hrs in Frisco. Will I take the BART again? Most likely I will."

1,"Sep 17, 2007","why oh why BART did you opt for cloth seats? wouldn't it have been better to have had seats that could be cleaned so the trains wouldn't be filled with dirty seats and a horrible smell? I live on the peninsula so it is not often that I take BART: sometimes to work, sometimes to the airportTo take BART to the airport is frustrating. 2 trains.....why couldn't it have been designed so that you didn't have to wait for a 2nd train upon arrival?"
5,"Mar 6, 2009","Oh YEAH free parking!  (But my Mom recently said that they may start charging for it.) I just love this BART station because you can always find a seat right before it starts to head into the City. It's always fairly easy to purchase a ticket and you don't have to deal with crackheads or drunken stuppers when waiting around for your train. Good, clean, BART station for good, clean fun - highly recommended if you don't want to deal with driving into SF."
4,"May 29, 2013","Clean and efficient - if not a bit noisy a la NYC. The good thing about the transit is that it can take you as far as Sonoma if you need it. Bt considering parking and other headaches associated with a rental car, plan on using the public trans system - it's just about the same price with out the need for Motrin."
2,"Sep 4, 2014","I've been riding on BART since the 90's, ever since I moved to the Bay Area from Chicago. I've been commuting regularly into the city for the last seven years, as I would prefer not to drive and worry about the sacrilege that is finding parking in the SoMA/FiDi. If there was a more efficient, consistently-performing, cheaper alternative (we're supposed to have jet packs and flying cars by now, right?), I'd be using it in a heartbeat...but unfortunately, I have no other choice. But after having experienced Portland, Oregon's TriMet and MAX Line systems recently, I am just filled with utter frustration with BART.Sure, every city and state government has its' hiccups when it comes to spending on public programs. Since I am not a resident of Portland, Oregon, I don't see the issues that nudge at the locals. But in regards to their public transportation system, you see where the money goes.For the most part, their drivers are basically polite, and then there are those who are downright warm and friendly, without fail. How many buses have you been on where the disembarking riders speak or shout out a ""thank you"" to the driver? Again, I'm from Chicago, and I've never really seen that in my life!Don't get me wrong: there are very warm train car operators, booth attendants, janitors and police personnel who work for BART, but they are certainly a minority. Their example should be the majority. For example, there are several train operators on the Pittsburg/Bay Point line who I find are normal, friendly voices to hear overhead. They keep you posted on delays and sometimes you can hear that they share your frustration, too. There is one gentleman in particular, who states each stop clearly and sometimes gives additional information about the stop; he also speaks in Spanish occasionally! He also ""nudges"" commuters awake right before arriving at Embarcadero. That is someone who is good at doing their job and going beyond their requirements. This is what I like.Here is what I dislike.It's what you've been hearing from many, many people before, and unless some serious changes are made, you will continue hearing many more similar comments. Let's skip the whole part about these train cars being very old. Yes, BART has been operating since the 1970's (George Lucas fans might remember how futuristic BART trains looked like when they saw them in ""THX 1138""), but these train cars were assembled as early as the late 60's, from what I understand. The train cars are technologically outdated and just downright filthy. I can't tell you how many times I give off a sigh of relief when I am able to board a train car with a bare floor AND the newer seat upholstery. If the trains are being cleaned, they're not being cleaned as much as they need to be.New train cars? Hold your breath until 2017. Three years to wait. THREE more years of waiting.Fare enforcement? Practically non-existent. The closest thing I've seen of it was at Concord station, when a BART employee yelled at a guy who tried to ""piggy back"" through the turnstile. Unfortunately, I've seen more people---mostly guys---jumping the turnstile then catching a bus than BART security enforcing the ""no ticket, no ride"" policy. These guys are rarely caught, it seems.And why the hell are there buskers ON the train? Someone else wrote in a review about a couple walking through the train cars asking for money. If it was the same couple I saw, the husband was playing an accordion. An ACCORDION. What the hell?!?And performance artists. Really?!? I grew up in the 1980's in Chicago and not ONCE did I ever see that on the Ravenswood/Brown line or any other route for that matter. Sadly, I've seen this TWICE. If you're a performance artist doing a skit on a BART train, you need to find a better paying second job because your career counselor lied to you in high school/college.I think I've said way more than I needed to, and I'm not really saying anything new. All that regular BART commuters can expect are fare hikes in the next few years, just to get the kinds of service that other cities already receive for the kind of money they put into it."

4,"Jul 23, 2008","if you're too good to ride public transit, don't bother reading.  it won't change your mind anyways.i've taken bart  a number of times, more recently to get to giants games.  i love the convenience of not having to drive, and thus not having to find parking in the city.  not to mention being able to sleep on the way there, that's a definite plus.  it's a good reliable way to get in and out of the city.  i'm  a fan."
3,"Aug 7, 2009","I've been commuting from the East Bay to SF for too many years to count.  During this time, I've done it all - BART, AC Transit, MUNI and driving my car.  Compared to the 10 year span when I drove my kids to school in SF, then took MUNI and BART in to work, my commute now is a cakewalk.  BART is a 5 minute drive from my house and 10 minute walk to my office.  So I really shouldn't complain, but it is just inherit in my nature to constantly bitch and moan. It seems that nothing (or no one) makes me happy, or is good enough for me.  I hate when the train is so crowded in the morning that there are already no available seats on the second stop to SF.  Why can't they divert some of the trains from the Pittsburg/Baypoint line that arrive every 2 minutes, and spread some of the love around?  And if I want to get a seat on the ride back home, I have to hop on a train going in the opposite direction, get off a couple of stops down, then take my regular train home.  There's always some sort of delay or other at least once a week, but overall, it still beats driving, or MUNI, so I'll quitmybitchin now."
5,"Apr 10, 2013","My transit experience on this was limited, however, we weren't going anywhere crazy or off the gride so we go to where we needed decently with a few transfers to Hearst and back. The lines are confusing and take a while to get used to, however, there was no shortage of people who will help. Round trip for what is 3 zones in Vancouver is less than $5. Very reasonably priced. I would've paid $14 back home without a pass."
2,"Oct 19, 2012","In New York, there is a MetroCard that offers riders the option of paying one fee for unlimited rides on buses and subways for a month. Same with Chicago's Metro system. Even Los Angeles's crappy Metro system offers a Metro day pass. But here in the Bay Area, we have to deal with overpriced transit from BART, who introduced what is quite possibly the worst possible system with the Clipper Card. You can't get a Clipper Card at a transit station. You have to go to a retailer like Walgreen's or Ace Hardware. You can't reload a Clipper Card at a transit station. You have to go to back to a retailer like Walgreen's or Ace Hardware. You can set up an Autoload for your Clipper Card, but you have to create an account on the Clipper Card website, and then call in to their Customer Service line to setup a security question, and then it can take up to ten days for your first Autoload to get loaded. Sigh. BART and its transit partners in the Bay Area need to look at New York City's system on how to do transit right, and dump this worthless Clipper Card system.As for the trains themselves, it's great they're finally replacing those disgusting old seats with new vinyl seats, but that's only a Band-Aid on a much bigger problem. Your cars are old, too many riders scoff at the rules of the system because there is zero enforcement, the air circulation inside the cars is lacking, there are too many bums who use the trains as their primary residence, and all this adds to an unpleasant ride. I only go on BART when I absolutely have to use it, which I try to do as little as possible.When I lived in Brooklyn years ago, my wife and I would go in to Manhattan all the time, because the system was cleaner and less taxing on our wallets. Needed to get from Coney Island to Dyckman Street on the New York subways? $4.00 round-trip. Round-trip from Concord to Embarcadero? $10.70. Both trips are about 26mi each way, so why is BART 2.5x more expensive? That $6.70 difference keeps me from spending $100 or more per lost visit in San Francisco."
1,"Nov 30, 2015",The trains are not in great condition. The system is full of dodgy people and the trains are late a lot of the time. Cannot give a good review at all.

So enjoy your bart ride to wherever your adventure takes you!!!"
1,"Nov 23, 2015","BART delayed yet again.  Generally, this transportation system is terrible.  There are always equipment problems or other delays.  I tried giving them the benefit of the doubt but it is a bit hard to do so when you are constantly getting stranded and left waiting along the line.  Here's to BART, a singularly terrible option made still more terrible by the fact that it is often the single option available."
3,"Nov 17, 2015","So having BART is a big help in the Bay Area.  I think most people wouldn't doubt that, and I'm grateful that it's here.  But, more recently, it's been plagued with delays!  Perhaps it's jut the timing of when I take BART, but there are so many delays due to equipment failure issues.  Also, the parking is getting to be really expensive!  All in all, it seems like we are pouring more and more money into this system and getting less and less back.  I really wish would BART would pull itself together and get back on the right track, but based on what I've seen so far, I sort of doubt it will."
1,"Mar 18, 2009","Why was the train stopped at 24th St. yesterday afternoon for a ""BART police incident""? BART police were harassing the handicapped, detaining him for 5 hours and collecting $155 from him.  Yesterday, a friend who is legally handicapped decided to take the train to see me. He cannot walk well and usually gets a ride, and hadn't ridden BART in a few years.. He purchased a handicapped-price ticket and boarded without incident in Daly City. By the 24th St station, cops were on the scene and dragged him from the train. (How were they alerted anyway? Is this what BART is using their $5.4m grant from Homeland Security for?)  He showed them his leg braces and Medi-Cal i.d. to no avail - it seems now you need to show them your Medicare card. His phone was grabbed from him when it rang, and he was not allowed to call anyone (like me, the person waiting for him), thank you. He says he was verbally harassed. He was fined $80 and forced to buy a $75 ""appropriate"" i.d. (one that as far as we can determine from BART's website costs $3)  and not allowed to continue on his journey - his wife had to pick him up at 24th St. Of the many things I dislike about BART - the constant fare hikes, the lack of direct service to a large percentage of its area, the four-car trains that are jammed full, the fact that it stops running before the bars close, so many other fine qualities - this one got me to speak out."
3,"Apr 5, 2009","BART is clean and seems to be on-schedule.  It really helped us to get downtown pretty quickly from the airport.However, public transportation normally DOES NOT COST THAT MUCH.    Here is a comparison from Chicago- to take the CTA blue line downtown from O'Hare (17 miles outside of downtown), it costs $2.25.  That is AFTER a recent fare increase!  For me to take BART downtown from SFO (under 11 miles), it was $5.35.  Even the more expensive (nicer) Metra would only cost $3.80 to take downtown from O'Hare.Anyway, I was happy that it got us there quickly and cheaper than a cab, and the seats were comfortable.  I'll give it 3 stars."

1,"Jul 15, 2016","I have been on public transit systems throughout the world and BART is one of the worst because the station employees do not seem to think they actually work for the public.  Forget about getting help at the stations; I'm not even sure why they have the disinterested and surly people ""working"" there. And can anybody ever understand what the individuals over the intercoms on the train are saying?  I have never been paid for doing nothing so I am not sure why Bart employees feel they should be. It's a shame because it could be a really good system and there would be more public support if only Bart employees from the top down would act like they care even a little bit about your experience."

4,"Jan 12, 2008","The dispelled fallopian philanderer. He stood tall, dark of nature and dressed to his stereotype. Looking on to his reflection in the window he broke into a compelling monologue of traveling sensibilities, ""Yeah holmes, this whole check-in business two hours before you fly just ain't right man. It ain't right."" Pausing briefly he stood and decomposed his stance, shoulders straightening and wrists going slight with a hint of limp. He pushed his head back with dramatic aplomb, a second personality throwing out a response as flamboyant as it was unexpected, ""Oh sweetie, but one simply must check-in early lest you miss your flight. We really can't have have people missing flights, now can we dear?"" It was black man met Martha Stewart, the former taking manic offense at his split-headed indiscretion.

5,"May 29, 2008","My friend BART! Sure the prices have gone up over the years, but it definitely is convenient when you're trekking into the city. With the price of gas, parking...the headaches of traffic and etc, it's always worth the piece of mind to hop on the train and go. Bart in my opinion is superior to any other rapid transit system in California...esp. LA and SD. From the howling sounds of the train on the tracks, down to the toot of the signature horn, there's nothing like the Bart experience."
3,"Oct 9, 2009","After chilling with SEPTA (Philly) and Metrolink (St. Louis) for more years than I wish to count, damn near anything is an improvement.

They say on the news that they are going to clean up the messy trains with all that surplus money they have this year.  I'm still pissed about that shirt that got ruined with a chewing gum stain.  So aparently there are actual Bart Police?  Where the hell are they?  I wanna see one walking though a train just once.  I ride this thing 3 times a week and have never seen one.  Why am I complaining about this?  Why are you reading a review this long about bart?  Remember to bring reading material because its not that rapid.
1,"Feb 20, 2013","Today it rates somewhere between zero and one.  Some days it makes it to 3 and pushes toward 4.  I don't think I could ever give it a 5.   Today, their ""10 to 15 minute delay"" translated to a 45 minute longer commute because, when there is a delay in the commute direction, you can't possibly get on a packed train at a transfer station like MacArthur.  I took a train in the other direction to downtown Oakland to see if I could get on, but two more trains completely jammed with commuters passed before I could get on board.  But the icing on the cake was their announcement around Orinda that it was no longer a Concord train; they were turning it back at Pleasant Hill.  Everyone going further waited on a scary, overly-crowded platform for 8 minutes for the next fairly-full train.  And when we got to Concord, BART had obviously done the same thing there to a previous train because that platform was full too.  This all feels like some kind of BART control center power trip!Random points on BART's inept inefficiencies:-The heat and air conditioning settings on any given car have nothing to do with external temperatures.-The digital signs in the stations that provide train times are right about 20% of the time.  The signs for which track to use to catch the appropriate train are right about 80% of the time.-The train operators are highly unprofessional with comments like ""I know it's tight, but squeeze closer and smile at your neighbor"" -- not what you want to hear when you're already 40 minutes late. LOTS of smart-alec employees making smart-ass remarks.-Big lead-in announcements, ""This is a special announcement from the BART operations control center"" to tell you which elevators are broken down.  That's just kind of pathetic.-The train speaker volume is often either so low it's inaudible or so loud it hurts your ears.-Their is NO coordination between Pittsburg and Richmond lines at MacArthur station and you are just apt to see train doors close in your face as you are to wait 15 minutes or more for a train.-The stations are filthy -- people-grime yes -- but holding the railing as I ascended stairs left my hand absolutely black with grime in Oakland tonight.-There was a bat flying around the 19th Street station tonight -- ok, not really a BART issue, but I was waiting for panic to set in on the crowded platform.-Changing the destination of the train during the trip is a major major slap-in-the-face to us riders.  It really kills any sense that you think they CARE about getting people delivered on time.-Raising rates, paid parking, paid bicycle lockers, in-your-face advertising that provides revenue, etc. with the trains, stations, elevators/escalators and service in such a filthy and unreliable state is incomprehensible. -No food, drink, smoking, loud music rules that are constantly disobeyed by those who don't care because there are no repercussions, except an occasional blast by a station agent through the loud speaker system that impacts all the rest of us.-There is NO use for BART time tables.  They have absolutely nothing to do with when a train actually arrives at a station.  Hilarious to see people looking up the times on these boards in the stations; waste of paper, ink, space, whatever.-BART technology and stations are worn-out vestiges of some prior decade which the agency fails to properly upgrade; they seem to have no interest in turning it into a world-class system, perhaps because they are already so far behind.These are just some of my observations on the BART side.  The commuters themselves should have a book written about them!  Strange, strange, strange ideas of what is appropriate and acceptable public behavior.I have major issues with the violent apprehensions made by BART police officers, but I have recently witnessed two different officers being exceptionally caring and nice to a person who appeared to have Down's Syndrome.  Those rare occasions are wonderful to see.I know it is better than sitting in traffic jams with people who are driving while using their cell phones.  I just wish I could afford to live within walking distance of my office!  I do find it astonishing that a high-tech center like the Bay Area can't have something a whole lot more reliable and user-friendly but affordable.My challenge to all you who feel the need to rant about BART -- what does that acronym really stand for?  And please don't tell me Bay Area Rapid Transit.  I want to hear much more creative responses!  ...more along the lines of Basically Awful Reliance-free Trains.Or, if you're more inclined, how about a BART subtitle that the agency could use in their marketing campaigns, like ""BART -- We apologize for the inconvenience"".I just needed to get a horrible commute off my chest, but feel free to have some fun with your public responses here.  :)  Oh, and don't forget ""to check around you for personal belongings"".  Shall I list those for you? ""wallets, cell phones, newspapers"" LOL"

It isn't perfect at all, it still isn't a N.Y. subway or anything, but it will get you where you need to go.  don't think of it as the end all of mass transit, but it does work as the main branch with Muni and A.C. transit branching off."

3,"Jun 14, 2006","I'm a relatively new (since April '06) daily commuter on BART.  So far, so good -- a definite improvement over MUNI (I rode the N-Judah to work for 3 years). First, the good: (1)  BART trains are much more comfortable than MUNI's fleet of light rail trains.  This is probably a no-brainer, but I appreciate the width of the cars (cuts down on the ""cattle car"" effect) and the fact that they have carpeted floors (which I like mainly for the noise reduction factor, and for comfort on those days when I have to stand, which is fairly rare). (2)  BART has a great on-time ""track record,"" with some notable exceptions (see below). (3)  BART's station stops throughout the Bay Area all seem fairly logical to me; the layout of the system was planned very well. Now, the bad: (1)  Many (most?) BART trains need to have all or most of their seats reupholstered.  Yesterday. (2)  Almost all of BART's fairly avoidable service interruptions seem to take place during rush hour (obstacles blocking the track, computer malfunctions shutting down the Transbay Tube, to name a few).  This is a mystery to me. (3)  As much as I believe MUNI needs to raise its fares, I also believe BART is a bit over-priced, and should consider evaluating its fare structure systemwide. Bottom line:  for the most part, BART is pretty da** good, largely reliable, and its service to the airports is always a better alternative to taking a cab or driving yourself."

BART is missing: 1. more lines/stops2. lower fares 3. more fare variations (like 10 ride packs or all day passes)4. having more than 50 spots of parking so people can BART across the bay (I'm talking to YOU Lake Merritt!)     How do they not realize that these incentives will greatly increase ridership and revenues when gas prices go up again?     BART is always on time. But they are on time because they don't run enough trains to have a chance of messing up.  I also am surprised at the relative lack of crime with the missing security.  They barely have people at the booths, much less BART police (except at the coliseum).  Also, in response to a recent battery theft in my gf's car, all the BART cops say is ""don't come to West Oakland.""     Recently, the DRUNKEST day worker had to puke his brains out right before we get to the tunnel so I could not get off the putrid train and had to sit through it.  But, I have been there myself... i think.     Also, thanks to homeland security, there have been ZERO terrorist attacks! U-S-A ! ! !"
2,"Apr 25, 2010","How about actually going somewhere useful? Being that I don't live in Concord, Orinda, or Hayward, I find you useless."
3,"Jun 9, 2005","Nobody totally loves or hates BART.  We love that it's clean and the seats are cushy.  But we also hate that it's expensive (if you ride every day) and doesn't take you to every knuck and cranny of the bay area.   That's why it's in the middle at 3 stars.   But compare BART to New York City's Metro, which is the total opposite. Sure, their ugly trains don't have the clean lines and bright lit interiors like BART and the ricketty commute feel like you're traveling down a coal mine but, the dang thing takes you all over the place...all for the same set price, no matter the distance.  Their set price is currently lower than the cheapest BART fare!!!  Do you need to travel in relative comfort or would you want something like the Metro, which is cheaper and not too pretty?  Personally, I'd rather have something that takes me all over the place at a better price."
5,"Jul 28, 2005","I love BART, it's one of the best transit systems on the west-coast. It's cheap considering how far you can go. You can even take it to the airport instead of a taxi. There are a lot of stops along the way south and east. And I know people who live in Pittsburgh who use it all the time to get out to the city."
2,"Jan 29, 2011","Oh BART, I'd be such a fan if your cops weren't so trigger happy."
3,"May 28, 2005","If you live near BART, it's great, except for the expensive commuter prices as people have already mentioned.  If you don't live near BART but say, clear across town in the Richmond, it's a pain in the arse to get there."
3,"Sep 26, 2006","My biggest problem with BART is that it is't 24 hours.  If it were, I'd ride it all the time.  My second biggest problem is that it is more expensive than I think it should be.  Otherwise, it's fast, moderately clean, and on time."
3,"Jan 15, 2006","Not a fan of the new ad campaign with the cartoons barts running around. Other than that, it is great to take if you are going downtown SF and don't want to deal with parking. I'm also a fan of the fact that you can take your bike on the train. Wish that it made more stops around the bay, though. I also wish it ran later in the evening."
4,"Apr 9, 2009","Things I Like:1. YOU CAN'T GET PULLED OVER BY THE COPS!! aka no speeding tickets, seat belt tickets, no DUIs, no parking tickets, no bridge tolls, and you can text and call people legally! just try not to get shot by BART police... (RIP OSCAR GRANT)2. It takes me 10 minutes to get from Balboa Park to Powell Station3. If you have lived anywhere outside of a major metropolitan area then you know that paying $2.25 for a one way bus ticket that only comes once an hour, or even less frequently, totally blows and makes BART seem like its heaven sent.4. Comfy seats... i just try not to think about who has done what on them5. Feels like a roller coaster ;)6 . It does go to the whole bay area, or the important parts... news flash nobody wants to go to San Jose anyways and Marin can choke on a dick for being ""too good"" to have BART tracks running through their backyards. It would be cool to be able to take BART to Santa Rosa but oh well...7. Its free within the city if you have a muni pass so I always feel like I'm getting my monies worth8. Uhm it stops at 16th & mission and 24th & mission!!!! yessss 5 minutes away from amazing Mexican food and lots of dollar stores and I don't have to transfer buses or anything 9. ""Bay Area Rides Together"" is probably the best slogan for any transit agency Things I Don't Like1. Stops running before 1 am 2. Richmond train doesn't go to my house on the weekends3. Can be pretty pricey sometimes but that's what the emergency exit gate is for, am i right? ha just kidding....True other areas may have better public transit systems but if you consider the fact that in New York there are approx 2-5 million rides per day(more than all US public transit combined) or the Chicago ""L"" which has 658,524 each weekday compared to approx 380,000 a week for BART I think we have a pretty good system. Maybe if more people used BART we could get to a point where they could lower the prices and still increase the number of cars. Or maybe if there was a big enough demand it could run 24hrs?Overall if you put the actual size of the Bay Area into prospective BART is pretty damn awesome!!!!!"
4,"Mar 8, 2012","You can get from the Airport to San Fran or San Fran back to the airport for $8.10 each way.  The seats are padded and comfy.  Once you get to the station, you simply buy a ticket.  You can pay via cash or credit card.  Once you get to the city, you can take a cab (Not an abundant supply like Chicago), or bus/trollly. It's a super easy way to get from the airport to the city. I don't know the other uses."
2,"Dec 4, 2011","Not a lot of experience with public transportation. It was cheaper than taking a cab where we were going but I think I will stick with the cab next time. The cars and seats were quite filthy and stained, a small stench as well. Felt like I needed to take a shower and was my clothes when I got off."
3,"Mar 21, 2016",Bart is Overpriced charges you by how far you are going most other public transit rail charges only one flat rate no matter the distance.
4,"Feb 19, 2006","Anything that can get you from downtown Berkley to the corner of Powell and Market in under 25min. is a god-send. I only paid 3.25 for a one way trip across the bay, cant beat that! Especially when you know of the hellish traffic over the bay bridge on the weekends. Oh transfer stations make for swift easy transit change from BART to the MUNI Metro system."
3,"Mar 15, 2016",BART has had so many issues recently.  They continue to have issues that do not appear to be resolving. New issues every day resulting in delays as a routine event every day. It is discouraging when one pays a lot for BART already.
3,"Nov 4, 2005","three qualms:  1) too expensive 2) should run more during rush hours 3) should run past midnight on friday's and weekends otherwise, bart is great!"
4,"Nov 10, 2009","I can't believe I've just spent so much time reading reviews about BART.  I must really miss SF.  BART is an anomaly on the West Coast.  Where else do you have a rail system largely built in the early 70s that takes you to many of the big destinations in a metropolitan area? (Who are you fooling?  No one wants to go to San Jose.)  Certainly not LA, San Diego or Seattle.  What's great:- It's fast and efficient.  - It'll take you a lot of places in downtown SF (w/ connections to the Muni Metro & plenty of buses) , the Mission, downtown Oakland, and downtown Berkeley.- It feels like a rollercoaster.- Great views of the East Bay.- Relatively safe and clean as far as mass transit goes.  Okay, it's not Tokyo, but it certainly isn't as dirty and stinky as the NYC Subway.What's not so great:- Compared to other cities, it's kind of expensive.  (Compared to other cities though, getting into, parking, and leaving SF is expensive too).  - Save the Mission and the Market Street Corridor, BART doesn't really go anywhere worth while in SF.  A lot of non-San Franciscans and even locals don't like Muni so they don't go places BART doesn't go.  SF and the region as a whole would benefit from a line underneath Geary Blvd, and if a Geary line ever got built, then a Park Presidio/19th Ave line to Daly City creating a loop should be next.  (If only!) Why spend billions upon billions to extend service to San Jose and Livermore when hardly anyone out there is going to ride it?- The ridership may not warrant 24/7 service, but why don't you at least stay open until 3am on Fridays and Saturdays?  DC with a similarly aged and built system does it.- It's not very intuitive.  Thank god I started riding BART and Muni with the help of locals, otherwise I would have never figured it out.  Okay, that's my two cents.  I'd better stop now, otherwise I won't stop."
3,"Oct 3, 2010","3.5 stars...I don't have a lot of experience using the BART system but enough to voice a little review. BART is the subway/train system allowing San Franciscians to get in and out of the city and to bringing people to and from the airport. The trains and stations I found to be pretty clean, the seats on the train to be comfortable, and the BART map and automated ticketing stations to be extremely easy to read. Prices for BART tickets are a tad high (it's $8.10 to get from downtown to the airport), and at the moment there is no card to allow you unlimited access to all of BART and MUNI (though if you only need BART within city limits the Clipper Card would probably work for you). The system within the city is limited so don't expect to use BART to get around San Francisco but it is the best way to get out of the city for a day if you don't have a car. If you're more familiar with NYC transportation MUNI is like the MTA and BART is like the LIRR (or Metro North or NJT). I have 3 main issues with BART, first is that there are a few lines and it's not 100% clear which line you're getting on (only the direction), the second is that there aren't any announcements on what stop you're arriving at (and if there is an announcement it's completely inaudible), and the last issue is that when the doors open at a stop its extremely hard to figure out which stop your at because it's only labeled with small letters every 200 or so feet so you've got to do a lot of careful and quick scanning to make sure you're not missing your stop. BART isn't the worst sytem in the world but it definitely has its kinks."
4,"Jul 22, 2012","I was massively impressed with this station. It was right from the airport to downtown for me and the price system was confusing. It cost a little less than $10 to get downtown from the airport. I asked one of the workers how much, and was surprised at the price since signs said otherwise. He was right. Exit fares were useful coming and going. The inside was comfy. Taking the BART from the metro train was an exercise in confusion, and confusion won. I really liked that I didn't have to take an expensive cab, nor try to navigate metro trains and buses to get downtown."
1,"Jul 11, 2006","I try the subway system in every city I have visited. I have to say BART is the poorest performer so far. The fare is expensive and it doesn't get you anywhere. It stops at midnight and that pretty much mean one has to drive on a night out which really does not help cut down dui does it? And there is always some obnosous kid on the car to make the ride hell. For crying out loud, it is a transit system, not a side show."
4,"Aug 25, 2007","well i just visited nor cal yesterday and i took the bart with my freinds for the ""experience""well i thought it was fun and it really wasnt too bad in terms of smell and cleanliness. people were nice and friendly and the bart is indeed rapid at what it does"
3,"Dec 6, 2007",you smell like wet dog & urine.ew.
5,"Jan 8, 2006","I can review the BART? Well, without the BART I would be driving... So, how can I repay this rather large debt except by saying that the BART keeps millions of people in the bay area moving without having to sit on the bridge for hours and hours... thank you, BART. I love you."
4,"Jun 19, 2006","I actually missed the cut for the position to be the overhead announcer for the BART.  The guy that beat me out though really needed the cash, and he's got a great voice. I love the BART due to convenience in airport drop off and parking avoidance. That's all i use it for. It saves time and money for self or friends that are coming in or going out of SFO or OAK. If you can handle the occasional half eaten pear on the floor and stares from odorfull passengers then GO BART."
4,"Jul 10, 2006",BARTs convenience is dependent on where you are. If you live or work near a station it's so awesome. It used to take me from work to the bar in mere minutes on lazy days. Great way to get to As and Raiders games and stay buzzed. It gets me to/from both SFO and OAK but I have to take a cab to the station which incurs an extra $8. Still with the $3 something fare it comes out cheaper and more efficient than those blue buses that are your other option. I definitely agree some disinfectant is in order and some accountability on the part of other riders would make it a way more pleasant experience.
2,"Jul 12, 2006","I remember riding BART as a kid when I would come to visit family during the summer. It always seemed so fun and exciting head into San Francisco. Fast forward about 15 years (circa 2000)... BART seemed a bit worse for the wear, the trains were more crowded, and there were unidentifiable stains on the seats. If it was that bad then, I don't even want to know what it is like now. I gave up on taking BART to the airport a long time ago, and now just park at PCA Parking ($8.99/day with coupon!), or if I'm traveling for work and really want to be lazy, I'll just park at the terminal and expense it. I'm all for public transportation when it's convenient, but who the hell wants to accidentally sit in a piss soaked seat on the way to the airport?!"
4,"May 2, 2008","When Dave Chappelle visited the Bay Area, he noted how similar it was to New York's culture, diversity and how liberal this city was. He also mentioned how SF has its own subway train just like the Metro in the east coast. And so why I mention this is because I am proud of BART, not totally satisfied but content. I have to admit that I haven't had so much experience in taking trains all over the US or the world... but so far BART is still on top of my list (after taking NYC sub, Philippines' LRT, train in New O, etc) I mention this for BART is pretty good about keeping the trains clean and that the seats are so comfortable that I can close my eyes and rest for the whole ride. Also, BART is living up to its convenience, accommodation like stretching its stops to SFO. A couple times I've had to take Bart to SFO for weekender vacations and it met my expectations in re to time efficiency and convenience.However, on certain days BART trains are late and unreasonably priced(right when you get near the SF downtown area )"
3,"Jun 6, 2009",My last weekend was my first time using the BART. My friends and I were spending the weekend in the Bay Area. We flew into Oakland Airport and took the BART over to SF. It was a good trip.  The subway reminded me of my times in Hong Kong.  I was would take the subway all the time when I was there.   It's  a good way to get from the airport to SF. We were staying in Union Square so we were able to get off the Powell Street exit and just walk a couple of blocks to the Hilton where we were staying at.  It's easy on the wallet so there's more money to party with. =)
4,"Dec 5, 2009","So glad this exists, it makes life so much easier to go to the city, go home from college and not have to deal with parking and gas! Sometimes the trains are delayed, but usually only when there is a bad storm. You meet really interesting people on the trains too! There website even tells you what's near each BART station, so you can explore the whole bay."
2,"Jun 7, 2010","*Review is only about the situation that the letter describes*  In general BART is pretty solid.Dear BART-I am writing to express dissatisfaction with the strict regulation surrounding the usage of BART parking for regular BART patrons.  On the morning of Thursday, June 3, I parked at BART per my normal work commute.  However, I had a special situation--I would be traveling to a work off-site in a co-workers car (meeting my co-worker at BART to hitch a ride in the morning) but would be returning from work via BART to Walnut Creek (so needed to park my car).  Instead of making a commotion and trying to ""sneak"" by through the handicap gate to pay the $1 parking fee, I proceeded to explain my situation to the agent at the kiosk.  She listened and then strictly responded ""Unfortunately we aren't setup that way.  Parking is limited and we just can't allow it.""  I further asserted that if this were a normal morning I would have occupied the parking space during my regular commute (so the comment about limited parking was irrelevant to the situation at hand).  Had I reacted quicker I would have asked her to reference my EZ Rider transaction history--she would have seen my daily commute from the Walnut Creek to Macarthur station and understood that I was not trying to cheat the system.  There is a clear history showing payment of parking at Walnut Creek along with my normal faire to Macarthur and back.I didn't want to cause a scene so asked if I could enter and exit, the response I received was ""It's your choice.""  Because I needed to leave my car, I entered (as documented on my EZ Rider card history) at 7:37:58 and exited the gate at 7:38:12 after paying my $1 parking fee, a total of under one minute.  It's clear that BART has setup the system to charge potential parking offenders (that use parking when not using the BART system) the maximum one-way faire fee, as the charge associated with my entry/exit was $5.20. It is outrageous that I must pay the full one-way faire to enable a smooth commute the one day that I rode BART one-way.  I am completely aware of BART's need to prevent non-BART riders from parking in the lot (and I am in support of this), however, there should be some degree of common sense used by the agents.  What can be done to improve this system and correct this unnecessary charge?Pertinent information:Date/Time: Thursday, June 3, 2010. 7:35am Station: Walnut CreekBART Stall #: 40 (parked on the day of 6/3/10)BART EZ Rider: ****I appreciate your consideration and timely response.  Please feel free to contact me with any questions or if needed, please escalate this inquiry.A loyal BART rider,Christopher W."
4,"Mar 31, 2008","We all know BART has its issues, but coming from New York and the subways, BART is a commuter dream come true. The smell is not half as bad, the seats are much more comfortable, and the signboards in the stations tell you when to expect the next train. The only major downside is the lack of late-night service and less than stellar coordination with surface transit options."
3,"Jul 25, 2008",It is what it is. Gets me from Oakland International to Millbrae where my family is in decent time. I wish i could drink a Coke while on the train but I understand the no food or drink policy.
4,"Nov 7, 2009","I am an active BART Rider. I take Bart to work, to downtown to hang out with friends and to sporting events. Almost everywhere I take BART to (since I don't own a car). The service is good. Gets me from point A to point B fast. It's USUALLY on time, sometimes the train breaks down and theirs delays. Every public transit system has delays."
4,"Nov 1, 2010","System works quick, on time, for the most part clean, and free of the really scary dangerous people, but I don't think Cali has too many of them anyways, our weathers too nice ;)"
5,"Jan 5, 2011","Not the cleanest but it is def convenient. We need something like this in Los Angeles. Love the subway, has that city new York Chicago feel."
4,"Jun 14, 2011","I've taken BART a few times from Dublin to SF and I must say, I wish they had a system as convenient as this in Los Angeles. No hassling with transfer tickets or bus drivers who don't stop and gas it as you line up by the bus stop. No joke. At least with BART you get dropped off right at the A's stadium. Why can't the Dodgers have something like this?"
2,"Jan 27, 2006","Bart is way better than the disgusting, vomit inspiring MUNI but can they clean it???  Can they just steam clean the seats once a week.  I don't like sitting in seats that are stained and smell like vinegar.  I hold my breath and try not to touch anything with my bare skin.  EW."
4,"Sep 11, 2006","it is what it is, and it gets me where i need to go.  on a regular basis, i only take it to the mission, and it's easy b/c i can pretty much hop on the first train that comes thru, and i don't have to wait for a specific one.  i've taken it around the bay area too, and as long as the station is close to your destination (or you have someone to pick you up =), you're set. the cloth seats kind of freak me out, and it tends to be really REALLY cold.  but it runs a lot later than i thought it did.  and when i decide to hang out late in the mission, that makes me happy."
3,"Mar 28, 2007","Pretty dope, definitely gets me where I want to go and quick.  Minus one star for not letting me eat/drink on here, and minus one star for being dingy as hell.  I wish it was more integrated with Caltrain because I go up and down the peninsula a lot, but I have already called both agencies and it seems Caltrain is to blame for this."
4,"Jul 2, 2007","Not glamorous, can be smelly, is often filled with sketchy characters, there are probably diseases in the seats, but you gotta love it. I grew up on BART, and used it to get to work when I didn't have a car. It's reliable, just a few bucks to get to most places (including the City and airports.) It beats paying for parking if you're going to the City, a baseball game or the airport. Bring hand sanitizer."
4,"Aug 4, 2007","I'm from newyork so good public transportation is hard to find as far as I am concerned.  but BART is pretty damn good.  Oh, sure it's not the NYC Subway but it has it's own charm which I can not take away from it.  The trains are sometimes late, but generally they are on time....The cars themselves are futuristic with their carpetting and what not...The trains themselves remind of something from robocop-era Detroit...and the people watching is excellent...I just that they ran 24 hours like in new york.."
4,"Dec 16, 2007","I love riding the BART, it is so easy compared to other means of transportation. I use it to get to the the mission, the airport, and Berkeley. I tend to load up ten dollars at a time and that lasts me a few weeks. So far I've never been delayed, but I never use it during rush hours."
3,"Jan 2, 2008","BART has its stages of efficiency but when its bad, its really bad. If you're just going around SF from one station to another its really not bad, but the prices keeping rising and the service never gets any better. If you're coming from the East Bay to SF be prepared to spend $10/day because there is no student discount, monthly pass, or any other sort of meaningful loyalty discount. Also, the parking situation in the East Bay is atrocious especially at the Fremont station. I have actually been hours late to work or school because I spent an hour or two circling the parking lot. Also, if you catch the train at its starting or ending point be prepared to have the train park on the platform with its doors shut for 10 minutes then sit in the stagnant train for another 10-15 minutes on the platform. Its definitely a valuable service but the high prices, bad parking, and early closures (12:15AM is the last train) will annoy a frequent rider to no end. But then again, when I lived in SoCal they had no real mass transit system..."
5,"Apr 17, 2009","I love BART! It makes going around a lot easier. The only complaint I have is the price of going outside of SF, but besides that I love it."
1,"Jan 17, 2010","The more I travel to other cities and see their fancy subway systems, the more BART feels like 3rd world transportation in one of the best cities in the world. There is no excuse for this bullshit. My one star protest begins now!"
4,"Jul 2, 2010","I'm gonna give Bart some props on the mere fact it makes our city green. I think Bart has improved over the years when all we had was Daly City and Balboa. Now you can take it to the SFO, Colma, SSF and Tanforan. It beats paying for parking in SF and looking for parking! The only thing I would say is clean the trains a bit more, but I feel blessed we have Bart in the Bay Area. SSF is my favorite Bart station!"
4,"Mar 25, 2011","Oh BART..... Well, living in the City... unless I'm going to the Mission, BART is pretty useless to me.  I wouldn't be writing a review, claiming ambivalence as the tracks are literally ""beneath me"".BUT....Ended up getting a man who lives overseas (Concord, to be exact) and BART and I have become great friends.  Let's hit the basics....A lot of public transit systems completely blow.  They're crowded, smelly, inefficient, and add time to your commute.  BART is SOOO not these things...WHY I LOVE IT-BART can actually be MUCH faster than driving when commuting to and from the city at peak hours.-BART say, ""Its okay Michael, I'll drive"" when I'm paper bagging my to-go cocktail in my Gucci tote. (as long as its before 12pm *see below*)-BART has seats that can be a little questionable and I have read SOOO many complaints on here about them.  Listen... STOP complaining that the seat appears to be dirty.  I'll let you in on the secret... THEY'RE DISGUSTING.  Its a petri dish.  Lesson to be learned?  Just don't lick the damn thing and you'll be FINE.  Its cushy and when I'm making rides in excess of 15 minutes I appreciate it greatly.-BART can and is most likely to provide you with SOME form of entertainment, be it a dancing naked crazy man, a glorious conversation to overhear, or watching some pornographically disturbing make-out session with either two gross middle aged to elderly adults or two pimply teens (and no, those are the only age groups who do that and you know it).  And lastly, -BART keeps the East Bay crowd underground and out of my potential street parking spots.WHY I DON'T LOVE IT-BART......... Bart, bart, bart.  You need to LISTEN right now and LISTEN GOOD.  Run past FREAKIN 12AM.  And I mean AT LEAST until like, 2:30 am.  I'm serious now.  Don't even begin to play wit me cuz ima take out mah hoops and fight chu.Do you even KNOW how man car loads of club crashers drive over the Bay Bridge to hit up city spots?  And I'll tell you exactly what happens... Tina (generic condescending female who is pretending to be matronly and responsible to avoid her serious relationship issues in that she NEEDS a man, a real prince this time, and can't seem to find one) says, ""Oh, I'll drive.  I promise, no worries... I'm super hung over from last night anyway (what, Tina, hung over from the lifetime reruns and Kleenex brand tissues with lotion to wipe away your tears of shame? No, you're right, it was probably those big plans you had... ha.)THEN Tina texts her ""BFF"" dude who lives in another city just to see what's up (not like she hasn't been in love with him for 5 years after they roomed together in college or something) only to find that he's out on a date with some tramp from the marketing department at his mediocre job thats pays way less than Tina's though she pretends that she's jealous to make him feel like a real man...  And you know what, I bet he's taking the date to Applebees or some shit like that.  Probably for the two for one happy hour on cocktails and appetizers...... or somethingWell WATCH HER!  Because there goes your DD.... Next thing you know she's demanding chardonnay at a DIVE bar because she's had enough and this is really going to be the time that she stops talking to him... And you're screwed.SEE Bart?  THAT'S why you have to run past midnight.  Because those idiots think Tina can handle it as soon as she stops crying, and then they get in the car and DRIVE back across the damn bridge.Well, fellow yelpers.  I think you can clearly see my thoughts on the good ol' Bay Area Rapid Transit, and you can agree with why I've given them only 4 stars, rather than 5."
2,"Oct 30, 2011","They get two stars only because the actually now go to the airport. Other than that, they are the dirtiest, noisiest trains on earth, and I've been on a lot of trains and subways in developing countries. It's almost deafening when BART takes on some of those turns, and the urine smell in some of the trains, and the stained cushions, and the old newspapers, and the smelly people. Ugh. Makes me happy I ride my bike around town."
1,"Jan 16, 2016","BART recently raised rates, but service keeps getting worse and worse. Earlier this evening they were running only 5 car trains from SF to Richmond instead of the usual 8 or 9 car trains. Needless to say the cars were packed. Last night I rode the connector from Oakland airport--it was slow and stopped at a phantom station on the way. The last time I road the connector, it kept stopping and starting and backing up. It took 15 minutes. When I got on BART the car was filthy and smelled bad. When I ask agents for help they are often rude and unhelpful. I don't know why the public puts up with incompetent management at BART."
3,"Aug 19, 2006","My party shoes will never forgive. Walking from a gasp! closed Van Ness entrace to Civic Center station, finding my way through Parisian-looking metro catacombs (blind musician included - left my heart and money with him), only to take the wrong train in the wrong direction.  To kill time while standing, waiting ""six-teeen mee-nutes"" till the next train, I wrote a poem. Bart and CalTrain are the only places so inspiring."
2,"Apr 11, 2007","BART is gross!  So I admit, I'm a snob. Bart trains are dirty, stained, and smelly.  You will see the occasional homeless, crazy, or drunk person on BART.  I always feel like I need to take a flea bath and either wash or dry clean my clothing after sitting on those stained and smelling of I don't know what seats. Sometimes I think about what I'm sitting on, but I really don't want to - it probably will make me puke. I'm glad I don't need to commute to work on BART or anywhere else.  I take BART 3-4 times a year and that's enough for me.  The only pro is that it is easy to get around and fairly reliable, but that is about it."
4,"Jul 2, 2007","I've seen things dirtier, smellier, just downright nastier than the Bay Area Rapid Transit system or BART, as we call it. I can't give it 5 stars, but this system has gotten me from Point A to B without much complication for the last 20 years. Just needs new seats and carpet, perhaps even some security. Why does Bart Police exist?"
5,"Nov 16, 2007","Coming from LA, we took the BART to Powell Street! This was great. It took us right where we needed to be. Why can't LA have such great transportation. Yes even though it was quite crowded from SFO to downtown, it was so convenient and for $5.15 its cheaper than a taxi too."
3,"Dec 25, 2007","Public transportation is extremely important, and we're fortunate to have BART-! still... it could do a lot better of a job. I think people praise it here because Californians are so used to the idea of not having public transportation that they have very low standards. Anyone who's been around the world and seen metros in place in cities much poorer than San Francisco would be hard-pressed to call the BART fantastic.Going from the East Bay to the west Bay to commute to work is *very* expensive, although it did bring down my auto insurance rates a few hundred dollars a year. I'm talking like $120 a month just to go to work...  this is not an affordable option for low income people, but it beats driving a car.And the midnight closures... geez! what's with that? That being said, it's remarkable that BART's in place, and considering the history of Californian government, corruption goes hand in hand with projects like the Bay Bridge, MUNI & the BART. It's also bad to compare the bart to other systems since they depend on so much funding from the fares--Bay area people should definitely cough up more money for the BART, whether it's through some form of gas tax or auto tax..."
3,"Sep 8, 2008","A necessary evil with gas prices, bridge tolls, and city parking.... I ride Tuesday- Thursday... Fruitvale to Montgomery and Civic Center to Fruitvale..I'm very particular  on where I sit so I don't get motion sickness, either sideways or facing forward.... never ride backwards... NEVER... I must say though I love to eaves drop on conversation and stare at people... If someone were to ask me on Bart if I had a staring problem, I would have to respond with, ""Why yes... Yes I do!!!"" I've thought numerous times about writing a book about my travels on Bart...."" Confessions on a Bart train""... but alas I am always to drained from the Bart ride to write...."
3,"Aug 14, 2009","BART is not like the New York or Tokyo subways. Trains are infrequent, it's expensive, people don't really know how to act...but it gets the job done and it often beats driving. And i'm sure it would be way better if people were willing to pay more tax. Let's see how much we really need BART when they go on strike.On the other hand, F*** the bart strikers."
3,"Mar 17, 2011","What's with the people who ride the BART? I've never seen so many horribly dressed people at the same time in a small metal tube in my entire life. One time I felt the need to flee at the site of a homeless man running full speed through the BART with no shoes on. His feet looked really gross and it scared me! I'm from Seattle, and apparently our lack of good and efficient public transportation did not prepare me for riding the BART. The BART does get you where you need to go though, so 5 stars for that."
1,"May 19, 2017","I'm  very  disappointed  in  bart because its  very  difficult  to have  my discount  card  fee's  uploaded ,according to the rules after the  card reach  a certain  amount  the   fee's  are supposed  to  be  automatically  uploaded ,  i made several   attempts  to  have  my  Oakland  airport  discount  card  fee's  uploaded ,it's  very  difficult  because  I  have  to  make  several  phone  calls  and  wait several  days  before  the card is  updated , so  I  decided  to  cancel  the  card , Bart  sent  me  an  email  stating  that  I  should  return  the  card  to  300  lakeside  in Oakland , let me  tell  you  after  I  got  there  it was  a  challenge  finding  the  correct  department  but  finally  I spoke  with  Mr  Wong  who was very  nice  and  professional  and  I  decided  to  keep  the  card ,I was directed  to  another  department  and  that's  when  I  realized  it  was  not  worth  keeping  this  card  because  this  particular  person  was very  subtle  but  insulting , instead  of  helping  me  he was  more  interested  in  trying  to  talk  down  to  me and  insult  the  discount  amount , the  discount  is   $4 off  a $6 fare from Oakland  airport  to the  coliseum  bart  station , his  phone  number  is  464-6969 let  me  tell  you  this  guy  is  the  personification  of everything  that  is  wrong  with  bart , the trains are unsafe  now the stations  are filthy    ,the train  car's  are very  dirty  and  smells  very  bad , after  reconsidering  I  decided  to  cancel  the  bart connecter  discount  card , and  use bart as least as possible"
4,"May 22, 2006","Compared to most cities mass transit, I'll take BART any day of the week. Compared to something like Path in Jersey or Metrorail in upstate/connecticut, Bart ain't that expensive and is pretty reliable most of the time. Only thing I hate about it is the refusal to run overnight. Even if it was just one train an hour, that would make a HUGE difference."
3,"Jun 25, 2009","Really is OK. If I were a pragmatist, BART would be getting 2 stars, lucky for them I'm a train fan.Here goes: faster service, cleaner cars, cleaner stations, lower fares, more frequent service, less pay to employees, better managers/directors and newer rail cars are just some of the thousands of ways BART NEEDS to improve.I'm going to take Muni instead until BART gets itself together, lowers its  fare and restores normal service (referring to fare increase and service cuts for July/Sep 09)."
5,"Dec 17, 2010","Public transportation is the key if you're low on funds and/or care about leaving a decent environment for your children to grow up in. There's not a vast quantity of public transport in LA so it's a relatively new idea for me.  The biggest problem is that I'm directionally challenged so getting on and off the right train was difficult... Luckily I had some friends there to guide me otherwise I'm not sure where I would've ended up!  Overall, I'm pleased with the system they set up in this magnificent city. Next time I'll pay more attention and I'm sure I'll be just fine."
4,"Jun 20, 2008","This is the BEST public transportation system in the Bay Area.  Fast, efficient and you can trust the schedules.  Safer than MUNI or AC Transit.  A bit pricey but worth it.  Only pet peeve is that they do not enforce the ""No food on trains"" rule."
3,"Sep 25, 2008","This little station has helped to make life much easier for this commuter.  It does not have the amenities of some of the main hubs, but it is a clean and easy to access."
2,"Feb 3, 2010","I've had just as many good BART days as I've bad.  Overall I think its pricey, smells bad, and way to outdated.  I feel like I'm going to get a disease sitting on those seats.  Although I AM thankful to have a public transit system"
2,"Feb 23, 2010","I pretty much hate BART.  It's expensive (like $9 or more to get to the East Bay and back, which is absurd), the commute times are long, the trains don't come very often, and often time you'll have some smelly, smelly people riding with you.  The trains are dirty as can be, and they're often late.  Sometimes they just stop for minutes on end.  One thing it has going for it is it's not the Chicago El, which I despise.  One more thing, they close around midnight, so if you're drunk, drink a cup of coffee before riding BART late at night.  Believe me, I've been stranded in Pittsburg/Bay Point more than once, having to cab it to my destination in Lafayette/Berkeley/Walnut Creek.  Not fun."
4,"Jan 22, 2011","Cheaper than driving daily and parking. Some trains smell like piss though. Considering I work in oakland, love in the tri city, this is far better than driving (driving = $45 in gas every 4-5 days, $11 daily in parking, walking to the meter to keep feeding change so I don't get a ticket, plus food?) Now its only $8, no parking (get dropped off at bart) short walk from the vary station to the tattoo shop, how can I really go wrong?"
3,"Oct 30, 2011",It gets you there... Only if u plan to be home at the granny hour of midnight!
4,"Nov 4, 2012","Great for transit but change those stinky, soiled seats!"
3,"Nov 11, 2012","I think it would be better if all the train operators were communicative about no bikes at rush hour and reminded passengers about stepping off the train to let people off when it's crowded.  The few that do this get 5 stars.  Also, when there is a long delay like the evening we were stuck in the tunnel 30 minutes and only heard once about moving shortly it would be nice if the operator came on more than once so we knew he was still alive.  The worst thing is people who spit sunflower seeds on the seats and floors and the people who cut in and refuse to wait in line.  I once asked the girl who shoved her trash with half eaten food in it to take it with her when she exited.  It was a nasty sausage thing she was eating on the train.  She asked who I thought I was.  I'm just another person who expects the same respect I give.  I don't eat on Bart or leave my trash behind!"
1,"Jan 22, 2016","FARE EVADERSIn light of the recent fare increase, I get quite irritated when I see a fare evader.  I see it occur about 3 times per week.  I see this crime so often that I now can tell when someone is about to evade the fare by watching their body language.  They begin to look over at where the station agent is located.  Often the station agent is busy/talking to another station agent/distracted/assisting a customer.  The fare evader walks to the turnstile which is located farthest from the station agent, and positions himself very close to the customer in front of him who is in the process of going through the turnstile.  Then the fare evader quickly runs through before or during the seconds that the turnstile gate closes.  Often, the fare evader has a very satisfied look on his face, that he never pays for a BART ride, and never intends to pay again.  Can you imagine how many thousands of dollars BART may be losing?  (And we, the honest people, are paying higher fares for?)  If me, just one person, is seeing the thieves evade the fare at least 3 times per week, there must be many, many more that are unseen.One evening recently at the Pittsburg station, I witnessed another fare evader and decided I had seen enough.  I went up to the station agent, told her what I saw in a loud voice, and pointed to the fare evader.  The fare evader saw me do this.  The station agent did not try to detain him.  She did not announce anything on the speaker system.  As I was leaving the station, the fare evader followed me and told me that he ""was tired of people like me doing things to his people.""  I assumed he was trying to make my reporting of his crime to the station agent into a racial issue (I am white; he was black.)  He kept following me so I turned around and yelled as loudly as I could, asking for someone to call BART police.  After 15 seconds of my screaming, he wandered away and got on a bus.  I called BART police myself, but they never appeared.One time I asked a station agent about the prevalence of these fare evaders.  He told me the following:  ""the Board of Directors at BART have instructed us to not to do anything about it.""Twice, I have called the ""Comments and Complaints"" phone line to voice my concern about this, and asked what is BART's policy on dealing with the fare evaders.  I asked if they could please return my call.  I have never heard back from BART.  That phone line is: 510- 464-7134.EATING AND DRINKING ON TRAINSBART has signs posted in the stations and inside the train cars prohibiting eating and drinking.  It is announced on the speaker system via a recorded message, and the consequence when caught is a $250 fine.  Yet there are a good number of people who ignore the rules.  I wouldn't care so much about this normally - but I have realized how these rule breakers can actually cause a danger to other passengers.  When liquids are spilled on the floor, passengers can slip and fall.  I was in the same car as a woman who spilled her coffee right before the train departed the station.  Then I observed how the coffee ""traveled"" all over the floor of the car, expanding further each time the train stopped and began moving again.On my trip each morning, the train begins to become very crowded, especially at the MacArthur station.  I see people carrying tall, hot, paper cups of coffee.  They are standing up holding the coffee, and they are positioned extremely close to other passengers.  If the train comes to a sudden stop (which happens often), and if that hot coffee spills on fellow passengers, then doesn't BART recognize the potential lawsuit(s)?Additionally, scraps of food, ketchup, mustard, and other food items are seen on the seats, even in the morning, when you would think that the trains should have been cleaned prior to the morning commute.  Shells from nuts and seeds, chips, Cheetos, open cans of soda, and water bottles roll on the floor."
4,"Apr 30, 2008","Why do you guys trash BART? I must agree about the following:It is expensive.Some people's faces make me want to be blind.Some loud voices make me want to be deaf.Some perfumes make me want to have Michael Jackson's nose-cover.Is there a sign reading ""NO FOOD, NO DRINKS ... except if you are really desperate for your morning coffee and your blueberry muffin. Don't worry about the crumbs, we know your blueberry muffin is clean. Don't worry about the spills, coffee is better than pee!""That homeless guy on the back seat of the car is cool. He is sleeping like a baby, so cute! He deserves to be laying down on two seats. The poor guy is tired. I won't ask him to sit up either. That grandma standing up in the aisle should give him a little space. She is so annoying standing there, doing nothing, just wobbling to the left and to the right, to the front and to the back. There are handles everywhere to grab on to anyway. She is probably faking being old. She can stand fine, faker! There are too many pee stains but once again, Grandma is probably the culprit, the homeless guy passed out wouldn't do that. Crack make you sleepy, not incontinent, right? Perfect! The sign was right: that lady is covering the pee stains with her coffee!But let's get realistic:It is even more expensive to drive into the city.You can -but shouldn't- play Sudoku or read the papers while driving.BART is convenient for most commuters.It is very punctual except twice a year when it is a nightmare.There are no professional clowns on BART... but there are always funny people to watch or some happy ghetto conversations to listen to. It is important to be in touch with our time: some watch MTV or VH1 for the latest vulgar update. I ride BART! Once a week I get my 15-minute lesson on ghetto talk. I get to learn what my teacher's friends did to her, and how she is going to f&*#ing do all those things to them. Last week was ""How to pronounce the c-word"". Our teacher made sure we understood. She repeated it about 20 times. She is a great teacher and can really get the class to pay attention. That class was a special promotion: everyone in the car got to attend the class. The kids too! It was awesome!As a young man I always get a seat. I observe and choose my spot and my target, like a lion picking the sickest and weakest wildebeest, then a little push, a little intimidation with a light frown and of course, my i-pod on my ears. One quick acceleration, and I pass my victim. Once I have positioned myself in front of the seat, I slow down, I look at the LOOSER, give him a little smirk and  -very carefully- sit down. ""Sorry? what 's that? a ""jerk""? Hey, look at who's standing and all pissed off... the LOOSER!""All real men ride on BART. Real men are not gentlemen, they're tough men, strong men. There's nothing gentle about them. They will teach you how stupid it is to get up and give up your seat for a lady or an elderly person who will probably spend their day eating Cheetos behind their desk or watching a ""Murder she wrote"" marathon in their rocking chair anyway. They can stand, it is good for them. They should actually thank us, the real men!BART is great. Better to be in a grumpy mood altogether than alone in a car! At least we Barters (homeless crackheads, ladies, grandmas and real men) love to share and save the Earth!"
1,"Oct 28, 2009","The worst Public Transit system I've ever been on (and I've been on many). I spent the day in San Francisco on my way home from Korea (I live on the East Coast). It was my first time in San Francisco. I had spent almost 2 weeks in Seoul (my first time in Asia) and was able to negotiate around on their public transportation system with NO problem. It was cheap and amazingly clean. Probably the best system I ever had the pleasure to use. And then came BART. It was ridiculously expensive, inefficient and confusing. Signage was awful. We had to constantly bother strangers to ask for help and many of them didn't have any idea where they were going either. I'll never ride the thing again. I fear for America's infrastructure. We're looking more and more like a run down amusement park."
2,"Nov 1, 2009","I'm going to review a couple things about BART but first let's all get this straight.  BART is an intercity transit system meaning it services within the Bay Area and BETWEEN the cities held within, not within one specific city (an intracity.)  So to compare BART to MTA (NYC) or any other metropolitan isn't fair.  They're different, get over it.However, BART could and SHOULD be offering a monthly pass, a weekly pass, student discounts.  Senior citizens are offered discounts but come on, what senior citizen would want to ride BART?I'd take BART more, but some, and by some I mean A LOT, of the stations in the more 'rural' areas (coughcoughGLENPARKcoughcough) don't have an adequate parking lot.  Yea, it can park about 30-40 cars (i haven't counted).  But do you have any clue to what's going on here?!  MUNI sucks, so I'll drive to the BART station, I can cross the bay via BART, but where am I to leave my car?!  Seriously, build a freakin' parking GARAGE.  The BART Union is screwing you (not literally, I hope...)  BART employees are, on average, paid more than any other public transit agency in the Bay Area's, if not state or country's.  Don't believe me?Look at HOW much they get paid.http://www.contracostatimes.com/bart-salaries?appSession=119203790762726&RecordID=&PageID=2&PrevPageID=2&cpipage=1&CPIsortType=asc&CPIorderby=TotalReally?! Are you guys retarded?""...2 people to replace a cushion on a BART train, and some BART employees make more in overtime than they do in regular salary...""http://sfist.com/2009/06/23/bart_workers_to_strike_july_1st.phpStop using the CalTrain fare system as your model.  Also, you're in debt, BIG TIME.  Stop screwing the public for you're exaggerated salaries, incompetent employees and Bay Area Rapid Transit:D"
4,"Aug 16, 2010","BART rapidly became my favored way of getting around the City -- for an out-of-towner it was a lot easier to figure out than Muni.  Occasional panhandlers hang around to hit you up when you're getting tickets, and I was told to avoid the Civic Center Station, so I did.  Otherwise, I had no trouble getting from my hotel in the Mission district to downtown tourist destinations.  One side goes north; the other goes south -- and all trains stop at all the stations in the City.  It couldn't be easier."
3,"May 13, 2011","Oh, where to begin.  The three stars say so little.  First, BART is on time.  I have only very rarely been inconvenienced by a slow-down in traffic on BART, and almost ALWAYS inconvenienced by traffic when driving in SF.  And let's not get started about parking.   Second, I have not had the dismal experiences with fellow passengers described by some of the other yelpers; in fact, I find my fellow BART passengers endlessly fascinating, especially when the entire Raider Nation gets on in Richmond.  (OK, there have been a couple of very smelly, scruffy, out-of-it persons with whom one would prefer not to share an upholstered BART seat.  And suspicious substances on said seats.  But not as a general rule.)   I believe in BART, especially in principle.BUT.  I used to live in NYC, so I know what a working mass transit system looks like. And I can say the following:BART is too expensive.   It should be cheaper AND have more trains and cars so that we would have MORE riders at lower prices.  As is, lots of folks prefer to drive for understandable reasons, which sucks.  BART is not sufficiently extensive within the city of San Francisco and/or not sufficiently linked to MUNI.  The whole BART/MUNI disconnect can ruin your experience of public transit in the Bay Area.  BART is great for suburban commuters to downtown, but a fail when it comes to the city.BART should run 24 hours.  I say this as a person who lives along a BART line and experiences BART noise at close range.  It should run 24 hours so that a person can actually use it to get to the airport at dark o'clock.  So that people who work late or party late (especially those who party late and imbibe mind-altering substances) can get home safely.BART should have better signage for its stations.  A person new to town is lucky to figure out where the heck s/he is with those dimly lit stations and tiny, subtle station signs.  Still, I believe in public transportation, and at least people ride on BART, which is more than I can say for the subway in LA.  Go BART."
1,"Nov 30, 2011",rip off.  was in the area  and gased up here and looked on my online banking and they charged my atm account twice.  what a hassle of course when you call they hardly speak english and living out of the area he says you must come in before noon. ha ha ha.do not get gas here
1,"Mar 8, 2012","Worst rail transit I have experienced overall. The station name is posted in the smallest letters I have ever seen for a station. The station announcing is vague and low, blurred by the huge (I mean it. It's freaking loud!) noise. There is no visual notice of location and stations. In addition, why the hell it doesn't reach south bay? Overall, it sucks!"
5,"Aug 16, 2012",What's there not to like about BART??? Bart gets you to where you need to go in reasonable time with fair prices (except those leaving SFO).I don't know how'd i'd get around if it weren't for Bart. BART is the greatest invention since sliced bread .I love Bart and i hope it loves it me too.
5,"Dec 15, 2013","Yeah. I like this one. I get to check in to Bart Tube on Foursquare and why not have it on Yelp. Frankly, it probably is on Yelp but shows in no searches so here it is. The world famous underwater bay area rapid transit tube. I have been through it a million times and frankly is just fine. It is very noisy and I like to complain about cellphone service. Since it costs a fortune to have cellphones and ""technically"" service is available and good would it not make sense to have consistent and reliable service in there? I hate cellphone use in the tube. TMO never worked. Of recent use I hated Sprint. Data never worked when trains moved unless you were locked in a signal at a station. Sprint is gone bye bye and now ATT? Sucks. The curse of the tunnels? Fix it. Damn it. Half of discretionary income of all stupid people with no income goes to cellphone bills and does not work when there is nothing to do and want to use it! The tunnel is good however. It is long, dark and open. Trains go very fast and everyone sort of falls sleep as soon as the tube noise rises. Is very good tube. I recommend it. 15 Dec 2013"
4,"Nov 27, 2007","Basically, it gets me to where I need to go around the City or East Bay, but there is always that one car that smells kinda funky as hell. Anywho...it gets me to my location and I'm fine with that!"
3,"Jan 29, 2010","If there are BART stations located near where you are and where you need to go, BART is a decent form of public transit.  But some things about it just stink:- Literally. Upholstered seats, and carpeted floors?  Whose bright idea was that?  Whatever color they were originally, they are now splotches of yellowish greenish brown.  And the cars smell.  A redo of the interiors to something more modern and practical is long overdue.- I swear they must be purposefully hiring people who speak English as unintelligibly as possible, and then give them training in mumbling in their own imaginary language, to make the station announcements.- The ticket machines are outdated and not very user friendly."
1,"Jun 8, 2011","As an advocate for the environment, I have always supported BART, but  no longer. Last  night we took BART to the U2 concert. We exited the train at Coliseum BART to be greeted by multiple signs exclaiming that BART would be closed at midnight. Planning ahead, we sadly left early, our ears straining for every note. When we arrived at the pedestrian bridge linking the stadium and BART we found it packed with thousands of people and two measly 4 car trains visible waiting on the platform. Historically I have taken BART to concert events. They had two years advance notice of this sold out concert and they made no preparations to accommodate the needs of the  riders. Thousands were left stranded. We were lucky. We only rode one stop and were 18th in line for a taxi."
1,"Jun 23, 2011",BART sucks! The trains are always being delayed because of some technical failure. There's always a psycho causing a disturbance on the train. They jack up the fare constantly. It cost $3.10 now to get from downtown SF to downtown Oakland. Why so much for such crappy service.
2,"Jan 27, 2012","BART is pretty much a so/so transit agency for me, and there a few pro's and cons to take into consideration about them. First the good things  The trains are regular enough (more regular then most of the buses I have to wait on) and you have the added benefit of not worrying about traffic. There is also the fact that you pay depending on how far you travel, so if you want to only go a couple of stops you end up paying a rather cheap fare.  They are on Twitter so you can see if there are any delays, this isn't the most reliable thing, but I appreciate the effort none-the-less Now the bad things.  The trains are absolutely filthy, especially those horrible fabric seats that are covered with stains (don't want to even think of their origin). These same seats are often covered in a myriad of trash, mainly in the form of newspapers, which makes traveling on BART a not very pleasant experience.  Stations and their surrounding areas are not that well lit at night, which means I avoid traveling through them after dark if  I can. Especially the Fruitvale station which is the one I use most regularly. You'd think with all the money they have they could afford to put more lights up. Panhandlers are regular sights on both trains and their surrounding areas, more recently people have started trying to sell off tickets brought with stolen credit cards. This makes walking into a station an occasionally nerve wracking experience. The announcements for next stops on the train are often very muffled, which makes it hard to know which stop is coming up ... It worries me as I'd hate to think of the confusion and chaos that would occur during an natural disaster, or if some other emergency situation where to occur.  The worst for me is that air conditioning in some of the trains doesn't work in the summer. Being in a train, crowded with people, and no opportunity to open a window really is the pits."
3,"Feb 21, 2012","Bart system is OK and really help full in San Francisco, but comparing to other cities in the world, if we take Paris as an example it has a lot to improve. Usually Bart will be on time, but it has lots of cons. The train is not clean and I am usually feel sick after riding Bart. The fares are high and keep getting higher from year to year. The biggest con of the Bart that it stops at midnight, which is not very helpful if you want to come to SF on the weekend and drink. I am sure that Bart could save lots of people's lives if they could take the Bart at 2:00AM and wouldn't have to drive under the influence back to their homes. But, at least we have it. Imagine how would it be to live completely without it....."
1,"Feb 24, 2012","On the way home on BART, my brother visiting from NY realized that by giving me his swipe card with the balance of the $10 he had just purchased in rides, he had also lost his ability to exit the station at Powell St. My bad. I should have caught it. I live here. Ok, so we had wine with dinner.Duh.He negotiated a $3 exit with the Station Meister.  Now he has $17 in singles with which to buy future BART cards more exactly.You would think that BART would take advantage of all of the software smarts in the area to devise vending machines that either make change or allow people to buy more convenient amounts on their swipe cards.  After all, London can manage that -- and it is not a city renowned for its software industry.  But then again, the BART vending software likely was designed in 1975 by a transit system functionary, before software took off in these parts.Will that card he gave me ever be usable since it has an unused, open exit on it?  Can you have 2 entrances, if you did not have a proper exit?  Seems like a question for Kafka."
3,"Mar 7, 2012","Bart is pretty good for getting anywhere in the south city or in the immediate San Francisco area. The trains are kinda old though on the inside and the seats are torn up a little. Also if you live on the peninsula, you have to go to Millbrae or a farther station."
3,"Nov 5, 2012","Coming from Seattle which has minimal public transportation, I found the BART easy to use and a great way to travel."
2,"Nov 20, 2009",Yeah bart is cool if you only need to ride it during the day. When you need to ride it during the evening or maybe you work nights then you are shit out of luck. How many drunk bartenders or patrons do you think drive home over the bridge every night? I know a few that do it at least 5 days a week. There are about 500 businesses open until 2am everyday.I am a chef and on several occasions I have had to run full speed for 10 blocks because the last train to the east bay leaves civic at 12:20. Wake up BART if this were New York I could go anywhere in the city or east bay any time of the day. Any reason to close at night is not smart.
3,"Aug 26, 2010",Some of the Bart cars are pretty dirty looking and I didn't feel so safe one day taking it into the Ctiy.  It was nice not having to deal with the bridae and fighting for a parking so though.
3,"Jan 8, 2007","i ride bart into the city just about every day. it has it's issues but what it saves me in time and money at the bay bridge plaza is worth it all by itself. yeah, it's not always clean and there is no screening process so the unwashed huddled masses yearning to be free can ride bart and they don't always smell downy fresh. today i had one of those great bart experiences that make it all worth while. i got on at the pleasanton station with a bunch of folks, one of whom was a unkempt dude who was clearly not a frequent flyer on hygiene airlines. he immediately fell asleep. a lady sitting near him brought on a cup of hot chocolate which she immediately spilled all over the floor. she put some newspaper down to cover it. for the entire ride into the city, folks would get on the train, sit down, see the bummy guy hunched over and sleeping with the wet newspaper on the floor of the train. figuring the guy hurled, they'd flee to another car. somewhere in here, there's a great idea for having a few seats to yourself even in crowded commute times."
1,"Jun 5, 2015",Always delays as of recent... And I have to travel BACK three stops to even get on train!! Horrible! There shouldn't be 8 car train after work.
1,"Jun 14, 2013","Nasty,Nasty,No where to park,fabric seats on public transportation,Gross!!!!!How did they vote that in,and where are the Bart Police???????They only come out of hiding when they are called,and that takes forever,It's really not safe,overall if you can avoid it,don't take Bart,really not a pleasant experience at all,it needs a complete overhaul!"
1,"Jul 12, 2013",How come there's never anyone at the BART Booths? And then when I actually see them they are just talking on their cell phones or chatting it up with another BART employee. You BART employees make more than my household income and then you made me suffer not able to go to work.
3,"Jan 25, 2006","I want to take a pot shot at BART too.  I think BART is a great idea in general. Its fairly clean, convenient regional transit.  However, I have one glaring issue with this new Millbrae transit center and SFO spur which is set up all wrong.  You can't long-term park in the BART parking lot, so what is the use of having a spur to SFO if you can't park your car?  You can't even park overnight on weekends when most people are taking their trips. What are you supposed to do, park a half mile away in some residential area or take your chances in a strip mall lot and ride your skateboard over to BART with your luggage foisted on your back?  That makes no sense. I thought the whole idea was to provide a convenient alternative to the other airport transit options and to reduce traffic congestion?  They need to fix that and provide at least one parking deck exclusively for long-term and overnight parking."
2,"Aug 31, 2011","I live in the DC area and use Metro on a daily basis. I've also used the public transit in NYC, Boston, and Las Vegas (if that even counts). We took the yellow line from SFO to Concord. Similar to DC, the lines are color coded and it was easy to figure out where to go. At $10.25 per person for one-way fare, it was double what I was used to paying at home (for going the same distance). The cloth seats were a bit worn, the cars were dirty, and it had a strange smell. The ride to Concord was fine--the trains are a bit jerky and it is noisier going through tunnels compared to home. They utilize more cars (10 versus 8/6 back home). It was hard to hear the driver over the PA as well. We spent a few days in SF during our trip and even though there was a station near our hotel, it was just easier to walk or take the car to wherever we needed. If I lived in SF, I would probably utilize the buses more than the rail."
2,"Jul 30, 2008","Okay, this review is based on my most recent experience on the Richmond to Fremont line.  Just when you think you've seen it all on Bart!  I have been grossed out on Bart many, many times, but I have never had the urge to vomit, until today!  WTF?  It's bad enough that this line gets the crappiest, dirtiest and smelliest of the trains still in service.  So, here I am just minding my own business trying to get home, etc.  I was seated in the first benched seat next to the window.  Yay, I'm almost to San Leandro!  Next thing I know, three chicks sit down and triangle me in, fine.  Yeah, fine until the one sitting next to me reached over and began popping pimples on the woman's face sitting directly in front of us.  Gross, I'm freaking gagging just thinking about it.  It's disgusting enough to think of these wackos doing this in a more discrete location, but on Bart, in front of other (normal) riders, and putting an innocent victim in projectile pimple juice's way?!  They had the nerve to give me a dirty look for getting grossed the hell out, getting up, standing next to the doors and staring at them in disgust?  I hope you come across this post!  You should be ashamed of yourselves!  YUCK!!"
1,"May 10, 2015",Bart is an embarrassment to mass transit.  My suggestion is contract out. As a liberal I sadly say that the folks running this system are either inept or incompetent.
1,"May 8, 2015","OMG, an employee stepped on a tie and the tie crumbled under their foot?  Now there are delays around Fruitvale to make repairs during normal operating hours?  Hey BART, you have millions of millions of dollars and you are not capable to inspecting the ties the rails rest on?  You also cannot make the necessary repairs during the night when trains are not operating?  BART is a completely mismanaged organization.  Complete incompetence.  Stations are dirty.  Trains are dirty.  Tracks are apparently poorly maintained and unsafe.  Employees are rude.  Escalators cannot seem to be repaired timely either.  Horrible!!!!!"
1,"Dec 7, 2014",I am deleting a star because nothing in my original review has changed at all.  The noise the wheels on the cars make is a OSHA violation to the point where operators where earplugs.  What about us riders?  Does BART not care about our hearing?
2,"Feb 17, 2011","Okay, so one star is kind of harsh.  I like BART for the most part, BUT:1.  the employees are always rude, rude, rude, even when I am nice, nice, nice;2.  the inside of trains are alwayas dirty dirty dirty even though fares keep going up, up up3.  i seem to have to keep waiting 15 minutes or more for a train to come, guess that is my fault for not checking the schedule, but it seems like they would have more trains, especially on weekends and nights4.

4,"Feb 12, 2015","I've never really understood why people despise BART so much. I've read all the negative reviews, and I think they are all founded upon unstable arguments. Here's what I have to say. I used to drive everywhere. I loved driving, and I never even thought about taking public transportation due to such bad comments about it. But, I decided to give it a shot and started becoming a regular rider. The interior is always clean, the seats just got replaced from cloth to vinyl, and in my experience, the trains have been on time. The only problem I have is the expensive fare. I can go the same distance on muni round trip for less. That's just inner SF.. I do think the fares going long distance are a little steep. But i've learned to be okay with it, considering I can relax going into the city, not worrying about traffic, and scrambling for parking. I really don't know why the negativity arises. I think it is pure overreaction. Love BART!"
2,"Apr 9, 2015","Boarded the SF Airport train at Rockridge yesterday morning needing to go to Milpitas.  Floor of the car had the usual sticky, dried up stains from spilt drinks.  Not surprising since I could as usual see a number of passengers holding drinks that they had brought aboard.I transferred at Glen park and sat in the front of the lead car facing towards the rear.  At San Bruno a traveller struggling with two large suitcases and a large Coke in a paper cup got on but it was too much to handle and the paper cup hit the floor right away forming a small lake with ice in the middle.  The traveller cursed his luck in Italian and as the train accelerated from the station rivulets of soda and ice from the spill streamed in the direction opposite of travel.  People who were paying attention shifted their feet around to avoid getting caught up in the tide.As we braked into Milpitas, the ice flow reversed direction towards the cab but it trickled out finally.  It was a relief to get off.Why does BART permit drinking on the trains?"
4,"Sep 6, 2007","I love bart, I love it.  I love not driving or worrying about parking. Any hardships faced by the riding Bart pale in comparison to driving.  I love people watching on Bart.  I dislike the deplorable condition of some of the trains and some of sketchy ass people I come across but hey that is life.  I think they could improve security and cleanliness of the trains but you have got to take the good with the bad.  I do think they should have more trains, and run them all night long but this will come in time.  If I was a billionaire I would give the bay area the gift of a bart extension that goes all over the bay.  I cannot believe that it does not go to the south bay yet. Perhaps in time.  Also, I think that they should consider having commuter only trains.  The more you ride the nicer train you have access to.  Perhaps a dining car?  Or maybe even one with nicer seats?  All I know is that the chodes that ride on spare the air day or when XYZ bridge shuts down really piss me off.  They do not know where the hell they are going, and have no sense of etiquette."
1,"May 25, 2011","What's the deal with 3 car trains? And they always park center stage so people have to sprint from opposite corners not to miss it. Most of the toilets are grotesque and reserved for dire emergencies, if they are open at all. Most people behind the glass windows are gravy trainers who barely budge or listen to you when you talk to them. And the funniest part? Some of the conductors announce over the mike, ""Thank you for choosing Bart."" Yeah, like what other rapid transit choice do I have??"
1,"Aug 5, 2013","This is the most expensive transit system in human history. Wages are the highest in the industry and benefits are outrageous. Management is bloated and overpaid. It sucks blood out of the economy with a regional sales tax. And it takes BART *DECADES* to put rails down to a new area. Over 30 years after it came into existence, it still doesn't serve the southbay. They have terribly expensive rail cars from France, which keep breaking down. And the fares are too high. Lousy deal all around."
2,"Jan 15, 2015","Riding Bart is a crap shoot.  You never know if it'll be on time or have mechanical problems, medical emergencies, track maintenance issues, or public disturbances."
1,"Mar 16, 2015","My first review was when I started using Bart, and I was balanced and gave it like 3 stars. I was also inexperienced with it. I took it for about three years or so after that and it ended up being one of the worst public transit systems I've ever experienced. Overcrowded constantly, poor A/C, gross, and just not up to the demand of how many people need it. It has all kinds of problems. People would pass out from the overcrowding. The stations were havens of bum pee and intravenous drug injectors and worse. If you want to experience a waking nightmare, check out Bart on a bad day, which they have at least three times or more a week. I now use MARTA (Metro Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority or something) and it's far better: cleaner, more polite and sane people, better views, mostly reliable, and -- despite criticisms to the contrary -- it has a lot of stops inside the Atlanta perimeter (ITP). Once I started using MARTA -- which isn't perfect; nothing is -- I realized how poor Bart really is. You'll find Bart is a third world experience for first world prices. It's seriously equivalent to India or Japan's public transit. Avoid Bart if you can, if you seek reliability, cleanliness, sanity, and comfort."

2,"Apr 5, 2008","bart keeps raising it's prices while their employees rake in the money.  the operators, some of them, make over 100k a year.just an FYI bart was originally designed to be operated without any human whatsoever.  consumer comment gave the need for the bart operator.  therefore they must be the highest paid people on the continent for a job so easy it was originally automated.  just an FYI.and every time i wipe my ass bart is more expensive.  have you ever wondered why?  it is subsidized by the gov't.  where is all the money going?I'd like to know."
1,"Mar 6, 2014","It was my 1st time in years to take Bart. I went frm Daly City to SF and back. Daly city has several structures where parking has to be done. I gave the Bart employee in his booth (he was totally free at that time) my parking space no and asked which of the structures I must climb. He refused abusively and said ""you should know where you parked and shouldn't be asking me"". I told him it was my 1st time ever at Daly City Bart, but he refused help. I am a senior citizen and have never complained before, but I sent a complaint to Bart today."
3,"Jun 8, 2005","I have a really hard time quantifying my feelings about BART, so understand that ""3 stars"" represents a compromise between many conflicting feelings that can lean any way on any given day.  Here are my main thoughts on the subject.  Despite being corrected about my earlier assertion that BART is a private for-profit company (tip o' th' pin to Andrew S for the heads-up), the fact remains that--for whatever mysterious reason--BART is outrageously expensive.  It's just embarrassing to go back east and ride Boston's rail system, for example, which will take you anywhere the rails go for a buck.  Period.  Doesn't matter how far you go or whether you have to transfer to another line.  It's just a buck.  On the other hand, it's true that, for the most part, BART is pretty clean and timely and efficient.  In this congested part of the world, with some of the stupidest and most outrageous traffic I've ever seen, sometimes BART is simply the way to go--especially for one-time or occasional events.  I was also initially vexed by the very limited service offered by BART, but this is a complex region for any one transit system to cover by itself, and with MUNI and Caltrain around, no one system has to.  You just have to get used to the idea of combining multiple transit systems to get where you need to, and then weigh that option against the pros and cons of driving...and parking.  Ugh, don't get me started on *that*."
3,"Sep 21, 2007","BART is great for a lot of things...not so much trying to get home from the city drunk after 12:50am. WHY DOESN'T BART RUN UNTIL AT LEAST 3am?!!! I would use it every weekend, seriously. It would be amazing if it ran a little later at night. It gets 3 stars for just being BART and mostly providing reliable service for the majority of the bay area. Marin County could use it, but that's a marin issue and not a BART issue. I guess they're too good for BART or something.  BART isnt very clean, but it's about what I'd expect for mass public transportation.  The station agents have been hit or miss. Either they're helpful if you have a question, or when you come up to them they give you a ""what the fuck do you want?"" kind of attitude. My bad, didn't mean to make you do your job.  BART would totally get 5 stars if they were open late enough to let me get my drink on in the city and then transport me back to Walnut Creek....maybe one of these days."
2,"May 23, 2005","I doubt that there is a perfect public transit system anywhere in the world.  And I wonder what the hell BART is talking about when it proudly advertises that it was voted the #1 public transit in the country.  First of all, in a major metropolitan area with plenty of night life, it's a travesty that the last train leaves the terminus at midnight.  This discourages people from taking BART or going out altogether, or worse yet, some people may decide to drink and drive.  Second, it costs over $6 roundtrip from the East Bay to SF, much higher than comparable trips on a lot of other US public transit systems, and more expensive than in Japan where the cost of living is way higher.  Third, they keep cutting back on the staff and the train length because of budget cuts--one time, my ticket got stuck in the fare machine, and I had to wait for 45 minutes for an agent to show up and retrieve it for me.  At least it wasn't an emergency, but what if you DID have an emergency?  And finally, it's just insane or stupid or both to have carpeted and upholstered cars!  Some cars stink of yesteryear's spilled latte...and how much of the shrinking budget is being spent on cleaning or replacing the cloth interior?  And they're talking about raising the fares again.  YEAH, RIGHT."
5,"Jun 23, 2013","i told you I would review bart once I moved up here. :) I was offered a great job opportunity in the east bay, and have been up here for about two months. I love the bay area, and I try to ride the bart as often as possible, and I still can't get enough of it. :) I have even learned how to turn a blind eye to the solicitors who walk up and down each train! :)"
3,"Oct 10, 2011","i flew up to oakland from orange county twice this year for two different job interviews, and on both occasions, i utilized BART. i must say, coming from So Cal, this type of public transportation would make life so much easier down here; i probably wouldn't ditch my car in lieu of public transportation, mainly because i enjoy driving, and having a car to escape the city is vital. while i love the idea of taking a subway to work, the novelty of the BART would undoubtedly wear off, as i did notice that the majority of people riding the BART looked dazed, lifeless, and relatively unhappy. as well, the last thing i want to worry about after having a bad/long work day is an on-time train, and having to sit next to someone and force small talk. I know that if i lived in the bay area, i'd probably assimilate to taking the BART on a daily basis, and i would probably save $ in the long run. i guess i am basing this review from a 3rd party perspective, as i do not live in the area, but i promise to update this review if i do get one of the jobs in which i interviewed for..."
3,"Jan 3, 2007","I have taken Bart to the airport and into the San Francisco several times. It was a more satisfying experience in the past. I like the convenience of taking Bart but it's really starting to show it's age. The cars aren't very clean, the carpets and seats are starting to turn gray and it's not unusual to find bits of garbage wedged between the seats. Some are starting to smell gross. Also because of the terrible traffic in the Bay Area I think they should expand the line to more locations, like out to Tracy and to more places in San Francisco. The public transit system for the Bay Area really needs work! Still tons of people use Bart everyday so its not surprising they aren't working harder for their money. Also when I ride Bart there are points when it screeches really loudly when going over the track, too loudly to talk. I will continue to take it to the airport as it's more cost affective then driving because of the current gas prices but its not as enjoyable as it could be. I've also gone through the experience of the demagnetized Bart cards and it is a pain to get a new one. The Bart drivers are very nice and I have never had a problem with them. Some of them do mumble the station stops though. Bart should totally clean and update their cars."
3,"Aug 8, 2009","The last time I rode the BART was in 1997 which was my first time on a true Subway aside from the Metro in Los Angeles. I remember being excited like a tourist but fast forward 12 years later it was okay simply because it was cheaper than a cab or Super Shuttle leaving SFO. Plus even for a LA Native, the drivers in San Fran are CrAzY!!!! AND seriously the carpet and cloths seats were bothersome to me. I was disturbed by the thought of the all of the riders through the years, bacteria and the fact that I was wearing a dress. In D.C., LA & NY there are no freakin' cloth seats..who thought this was okay and I KNOW it hasn't be cleaned EVER...but anyway,  I survived, disease free and I'm here to tell the tale."
1,"Aug 23, 2013",Don't loose your Clipper card. You may never find anyone at BART who can send you a replacement. Over the past 12 years that I have been riding BART I lost my card twice. The first time it was replaced within a week. I was impressed and thankful. The second time Clipper and EZRider each told me to call the other party. They basically had me go in a circle and never sent the replacement card. I mad several calls on seperate days in hopes of talking to someone who could replace the card. They have my money but will not send a replacement card.
4,"May 26, 2005","All I ever hear is grumbling about BART.  It costs too much, the trains are always breaking down, people drive through the parking lots like frickin' maniacs, the cars smell, 1st rainy day always causes delays, it's noisy (especially underwater) etc. etc. etc.  Well, ok, true.  :)  But let's take a step back for a second and think about all the times you've rode to BART flying past commuters jammed into their cars.  Think about the books you've read, the naps you've taken, or just the relaxing view out the window, allowing your brain to turn off as you listen to your ipod while cruising along.  And while you remember the day the system broke down or made you late, if you're a regular how times has it gotten you where you want to go when they said they would?  I've been riding it regularly for three years and have to honestly say it gets me to work and back home again on time at least 95% of the time.  BART is FAR more predictable than driving.  Frankly, that's fine with me.  The main flaw with the system today was that it was designed solely to promulgate suburban development and was viewed more or less as a tool for getting suburbanites to their jobs in the city and then home with a minimum of fuss.  That was the thinking of the day and hence it is the system we have now.  Now, many of those office jobs are in the suburbs and the inner Bay Area is becoming increasingly urbanized.  BART needs to change to meet the times.  More trains for example with some of them being express (meaning they skip through some low density stations like South Hayward).  24 hour service, and doing everything to convert BART parking into housing, jobs, and recreation."
1,"Nov 25, 2009","Loud, mismanaged, cost subsidized by taxpayers, rude and unhelpful station attendants, unsafe, everything you would expect from a unionized transit system."
3,"Nov 15, 2006","Yesterday was my first ever time using BART (i use muni usually).  I was a little confused...  People line up in lines to get into the trains, which i liked, less pushing.  It was strange that each train goes one way, as opposed to taking the L line inbound or out, you just take the richmond line and it only goes out.  Inside, the seats were all fabric!  But, they were too low. I'm short, and my legs felt weird. What about the tall people?  It was much less crowded, which was good, because i had NO IDEA where i was going.  There was nothing to tell you where you were, and i could barely see the signs outside.  At one point, i had to stick my head out of the train to see if i was at berkeley center yet.  When i got out, i discovered i had to pay to leave!! I had just used my muni pass to get in, but i guess that only works for in the city.  I paid the attendant $3.25 and she let me go.  What if i hadn't had it?  Do they keep you on there, like the guy in that boston song the man who never returned?  The way back i had to switch trains, but the connecting one was waiting for me. However, i would have never been able to figure that out for myself.  Some ways i like muni better, but this is probably more reliable.  Bad points for closing early at 12!"
2,"Apr 27, 2006","Why it's called Rapid Transit, I will never know.  As a daily bart commuter, I know first hand that more often than not, BART is always at the very least, 3-5 minutes late.  So for all you newbies, NO your train will not arrive at your station at 3:03.  But if it is on time, the bart will leave your A** even though it sees you running for it.  Yeah, there is the case where you have OVERZEALOUS train operator, who stops for EVERYONE attempting to catch the train, and makes you even later, but that's more an exception, not a rule.  Don't get me started on their ingenious idea about UPGRADING their software during peak commute hours.  Yeah, only the BEST Transit Agency would think of something so customer-centric.  Some BART Stations are definitely better manned than others though.  As a frequent rider from the Richmond station, the station agents don't give a Rat's Derriere about what you do.  People smoke while waiting for the train, whereas at Macarthur Oakland, the Station Agent will get on that speaker and tell you to kill that cigarette.  It serves it's purpose, at the very least.  I arrive home in one peace despite the fact that I'm half awake.  Can't say the same result would happen if I was driving on 80."
4,"Apr 15, 2007","i only occasionally take BART to and from; its not great but its reliable.  i only wish the SF MUNI could be half as reliable as the BART.  before anyone gives BART a bad mark, think about the MUNI"
4,"Nov 22, 2011","I found it reliable, quick, safe, and relatively clean the half dozen times I used it.

I rode this wondering how anyone could possibly dislike BART. Then it dawned on me...it's clear that a lot of 1 and 2 star reviewers have never experienced true underground transit horror (thy name is TTC). You Bay folk have it very, very, very, very well."

Hopefully if they do again during this terrible economy of layoffs and foreclosures I really hope all of my fellow BART riders stand up and hold these ""If not for BART I would be digging ditches"" idiots responsible for their lack of accountability to anyone. I would have said they would be pouring Slurpee's at the local 7-11 but I have more respect for those hard working people. Come on who that rides BART regularly hasn't encountered this lovely scenario: (1) You ask your Average Troll looking moron Kiosk Attendant ANY..ANY....ANY question. (2) They take 5 minutes to put down what ever 3rd grade level trashy novel they are reading (3) It took so long for them to do #2 you then ask your questions again. (4) The look up at you with that vacant hollow stare and say......Huh? (5) You repeat your question. (6) The Moron BART Employee then repeats your question (7) You say 'F' this and start hauling butt after your train that is pulling into the station. When originally before this little dialogue started you had 10 minutes b/4 it came. (8) The doors shut in your face and you watch the train pull out (without you on it) and the monkey faced tard Train Driver has his face sticking out the little driver window with a lobotomized grin on his face (9) You curse so much so loudly that passers by walk 20 feet wide of you thinking you might try to attack them (10) And finally you wish horrible disfiguring accidents on every BART Employee and their genetically defective family members.

Then my friend Susan was like, it's not that bad.  It's so easy, blah, blah, blah.  She sent me the link to the schedule and everything so I was like fine.  Since I was poor due to too much shopping earlier in the month, I was willing to try it.  And it was not that bad!  I got off the plane, got my luggage, took the Air Tram or whatever it's called from the terminal to the BART station.  I had to run so fast, but I made it just in time for the BART.  Bought the ticket (a lil annoying with they way it makes you add the money then minus $1, minus 5 cents, minus 5 cents and all that.  Can't the ticket fee be the exact dollar like $1 or $2 instead of like $1.35 or $2.15 or something lame like that.  Anyways, I got on the BART ok.  The website was definitely helpful cuz it gives me the time that BART was coming (hence the running part), and it also told me which station to get off and how much the ticket will cost me ($6 minus 5 cents, minus 5 cents, minus $5 cents, minus 5 cents).  So definitely check the website out before getting on it.  The only other complain is the stupid speaker/intercom system.  It was so crappy I couldnt' hear what the conductor was saying.  If I hadn't pay attention to the station name and keep track of where I was, I would have been lost and not know where to get off.  But I made it to the city safely...so all was forgiven."
1,"Nov 19, 2008","In the wake of a profound post World War II residential and commercial resettlement, coupled with the consequent elevation in automobile demand, Bay Arians faced an escalating overpopulation of highways and bridges spanning the bay. Thus the BART was born, a system created to deliver the Bay Area to the doorstep of the next generation in public transportation HAAHAHAHA. Wow, really? Did you just read that too? I mean, seriously? Cummmmon!! CUMMMMMMMMON!!! Oh well, back to my point. In today's world, the trend towards highly selective career placement is skyrocketing and companies are forced to draw resources from a wider array of loosely connected cities at all Cardinal points of the Bay Area. In addition, corporatization is replacing the Mom and Pop shops with high rise economic giants and industrial machines staffing millions of ""blue"" and ""white"" collar workers as well as specialized labor in areas where residential limitations restrict the amount of local hiring available. The non feasible solution: double the number of Bay Area bridges from 6 to 12. The more practical solution: expand the Public Transportation system. The Problem: career opportunities have expanded, the population has expanded, technology has expanded, the movement towards a leaner, greener, less carbon, more enviro-friendly society has expanded, but the BART....it hasn't expanded and it is now itself a victim of overpopulation. Unfortunately, I am a number in the system, a sprocket in the machine, a working American plagued by the dilemma of fluctuating gas prices and the possibly devastating effects of green house gasses on the future of our planet.....well the BART actually zips me over traffic and cuts off an hour from my commute home but I do care about the environment too. Though each BART car has its own personality, its own sounds, squeaks, rattles, jars, pungent aromas and creepy BART engineers announcing over the speakers, ""Maaaaaaaac Arthur Station, our nnnnnnnext stop is Maaaaaac Arthur Station, your final traaaaaaansfer point for Freemont bound passengers,"" in a very Charles Manson-ish voice; there is one similar aspect of every BART car that I have come to accept, overpopulation. Every day, millions of numbers, millions of sprockets pile onto the BART telling themselves that they are getting to work while simultaneously saving the environment, assuring that little Billy has green trees to climb when he grows up, but in actuality, they're simply making an effort to save a little gas money and avoid the devastating consumption of the highway system by automobiles and there blaring horns. This overpopulation of the BART system, in essence, creates individual cities within each car. Excessive amounts of people with multiple occupations, cultures and religions pile into an area which, geographically, is ten times too small. BART personalities run rampant: the lotion salesman who sells Dixie cups full of lotion which he pours from a large container with no visible seal guaranteeing you that it was purchased and not made, the struggling musician that paces the overcrowded isles playing guitar gibberish, begging for money and sharing his lifelong story, the bums who only contribute to the already visible aroma and try to pawn stolen BART tickets, and the crazies who yell and scream about things that only themselves in their insanity can understand. Hormones elevate as the competition to attain the best seat, or ""a"" seat plays out, or the elderly and handicapped try to capitalize on their federally assigned seats, and involuntary exchanges of bodily secretions due to the close proximity of fellow passengers occurs. With each stop, more and more sprockets board the vessel shoving you closer and closer to the person behind you, into that small area of space surrounding a human being where you can actually feel their emission of body heat and warm moist expulsions of breath trickling over your skin. The BART has its own set of cultural standards as well. In everyday life, we know our personal boundaries and those of others because they have been engrained into our very existence since our birth. On the BART, different rules apply. Phrases like, ""excuse me,"" or ""Thanks for that taste of arm pit,"" or ""watch where you're sticking that thing,"" are replaced with grunts, groans and tolerant sighs because intolerance is not accepted on rapid transit. The air becomes so thick that you can feel its texture. The only thing that is stopping you from reaching up and grabbing a handful of it is the fear of what you will actually grab, and not having a place to wipe your hand off afterwards. AAAAAUUUUGGGGH!!! DEATH!!!  So as I am gliding over the freeway on an elevated track with my face smashed up against the glass window and three different people breathing down my neck, I sit in envy of the poor bastards stuck in miles of traffic, crawling down the freeway, laying on their horns and cursing the day they were born...I long to feel their misery"
3,"Feb 20, 2010","I took the Bart the first time as I need to get to rockridge from the SF airport.  Went on line but only found the schedule but no help on what line to take or how to go from point A to B.  Unlike some other cities, the website was not too user friendly and it was not friendly to new users.  After I got on the train, I could see that they needed money to upgrade the interior.  Also, there was no map, no announcement to let the passinger know where he was going or what the next stop would be.  I had to struggle and look out the window at each station to try to figure out where I was and when to get off.  Definitely some management attention required to make it more user friendly."
2,"Feb 21, 2013","If you can drive, do it for comfort, speed and ease. If you drive during commute hours, pick up carpooler(s) at many locations in the East Bay and ride through in the carpool lanes on the left and right sides of the toll approach. During the week end, the slog is a lot slower and toll more expensive but driving will guarantee you comfort (you get a seat), reliability (cars seldom break down on the bridge but BART does more often), company (some of the folks on BART are unseemly) and you won' t get robbed or mugged by BART (expensive fares), by shady characters in the train (bags have been stolen from under the seats) or at stations located in less than safe neighborhoods (pretty much anywhere on the BART network since their stations attract that kind of activities). I still ride BART when I have to but I would rather not. I almost forgot about bikes. Expect your space to be taken over by bikes and their riders and your trouser legs to be smeared by dirty tires. Finally, the cosseted and much maligned transit police is seldom to be seen and prefers to ride around in taxpayer-funded cruisers. Service is often interrupted due to ""police activity"", medical emergencies, breakdowns of equipment (quite common, usually during commute hours), etc. Trains are also very noisy and one can risk to become deaf on the long run. Because of a lack of long-term investments with shortsightedness from staff and administrators, new trains are not expected until 2019 at earliest... New seat designs will be inadequate for future riders so be prepared to walk, ride a bike, drive or move to a better city or region because this system has seen the end of its useful life. As for tracks, who knows? They don' t seem to be quite straight and travel through the transbay tube is ""swingy"" due to currents and tides in the bay. Again, do drive and if you want to save money, may I recommend the Smart? It is very economical and has all the benefits of public transit without the inconveniences. Oh and did I mention that BART shuts down at midnight? I know. Stupid, ain' t it? But this is what happens when you live in a 3rd world region."
2,"Jun 21, 2012","One of the worst public transit systems in the Bay Area with AC Transit, it makes you wish you had a car even if you never learned how to drive... It is slow, old, expensive, noisy, crowded, smelly, dirty to filthy, infrequent, breaks down often and repeatedly, and even has a police force that is known for killing its riders. To avoid especially during the weekends when trains are shorter than usual but packed with weekend tourists and their children, bikes, the airport trains are stuffed with luggage, and service is even more infrequent than during the week. So, do yourself a favor and ride carpool as much as you can. You will save money, time, have a seat and it will smell better. Worse of all, it dead-ends at SFO meaning that it will never expand beyond the airport down the Peninsula."
3,"May 7, 2011","I've been riding BART for about 8 months now. It's very cool that it exists, but priorities need to be re-assessed. They're evidently going to waste millions on the seats. How stupid. The seats are OK. As it is now, BART switches to once every 20 minutes on each line (while others just stop running) at something like 7:00 PM. How ridiculous. If they want people to ride instead of drive, give us more trains, more often. Trains should go every 15 minutes (at the most!) at least until 9:00 PM. Right now, huge lines form for the trains at around 7:30 and, if you want a seat, you'd better be there early. This is a big pain. I'd rather sit on less-than-perfect seats and have more trains run."
1,"Mar 1, 2013","I had my suitcase stolen on Feb. 26th at 3:30 pm at the Balboa Park Station. Coming home from SFO after a 5 week trip, I just wanted to get home and had to get off and change trains for Dublin at Balboa Park. As the train approached, I asked someone if this was the correct train (first time traveler from SFO) and when I looked down my suitcase was gone and the dozen or so people who had been standing next to me disappeared, along with my bag. I reported it to security immediately and was told straight away that there was not a surveillance camera on the platform where I stood. There was a tv monitor screen with only 4 views on it, that's it!! He asked if I wanted him to call the police and I said well YES, of course!! A very nice policeman came and took a report and told me I would probably never see it again, and he said that the stealing of phones and laptops among other things is OUT OF CONTROL!!!!!  Bart is not a place where you can stand and place a call to a family or friend without the threat of some thug stealing your stuff!!!! I have traveled all over London on The Underground and trains and busses and NEVER felt unsafe or feared that anyone would take my bags, not that it doesn't happen, but it never happened to me and I used the public transit there everyday. In San Francisco one day and in the very first hour get all my clothing stolen!! And I don't have the money whatsoever to replace my wardrobe. I had my suitcase right by my side and took my eyes off of it for 3 SECONDS, that's all it took. From now on I will only use taxis or drive myself..."
1,"May 23, 2008","Hello, my husband, our two friends, and I are from Sacramento. We have lived here our whole lives and come down to SF about 3 times a year. We came down last weekend and for the first time decided to ride BART. We waited  at Judah and the Ocean station on the Handicapp ramp because I walk with a cane and am disabled. The driver pulled so far away from the ramp that we were all running to catch the train. We got on and then our friend got off and we did not know why. We saw him walking to the front of the train, then back to us but the doors closed and he was left behind. His wife was freaking out because she had all his belongings and he has MS and she was just frantic. We sat there calming her down, trying to figure why he got off the train. She finally saw the very small sign that said that you had to purchase your tickets in the first car. There were no signs at the station or anything telling us to get on the first train. There was nothing written on the outside of the train and the sign in the car that said to go to the first train was the size of the palm of my hand and that is it!. We figured why her husband got off, he was getting tickets because he saw the sign. About that time one of the Security Officers boarded the train. She was about 5""10, African American, and about 165 lbs. She asked if we had our tickets and I personally relayed the whole story to her. She got really rude and had a extremely unprofessional attitude. She asked us all individually what happened and it felt like an interrigation. She made us show her our IDS and said that she would ""Give us the benefit of the doubt"" and ""issue us a citation, this time"" with a warning. She wanted my husband to run train to train at the stops to get to the front of the car and then work his way back to us with the tickets since I am disabled and I could not do it. We were not going to let our only man we had left leave us, so at the next stop we got off the train. When the next train arrived we got in the front of the train and bought tickets and there in the car was my friends husband and the rude, unprofessional, and just plain unfriendly officer. She said ""Well, looks like you found your husband."" And he pulled out all the tickets he had bought for us and showed her. Then she proceeded to check all of our tickets that we just purchased and then two seconds later the other officer checked them again!!! It was our first time riding BART and I guarantee we will NEVER ride it again!!!! We are middle class AMERICANS, tourists and nice easy going people and that was one of the most aggrivating, un-called for, bad experiences of our lives."
2,"Feb 26, 2012","I kept reading these reviews first and then decided to throw in something that's not part of any review here.  I used to take bart for couple of jobs in san francisco for a bit.   They're very timely.  On the other hand, unlike CALTRAIN they're filthy.  Atleat caltrain made the right choice of using trash cans and vinyl seats.     I had couple of friends visit from Europe and were really disgusted how bad and smelly it was compared to their public transit rails in europe.  And they being in U.S and specially san francisco couldn't believe how smelly and bad it was.   The worst thing that happens to the BART is by the homeless and pan handlers who don't shower for months and sit on them.  Oh My!  Couple times I remember getting on BART and then sat down and smelled a stench that was horrible. This time,  I could barely breath.  Then I noticed half the car was empty except for one big filty homless lady at the corner of the empty area and some people on the other corner crowded together.  I was in the middle closer to the empty corner and realized the horrendous rotting smell was coming from the filthy homeless lady 10 seats down!!! And forced all the passengers to crowd together for a breath of fresh air.    I tried to act as if I was sick having a cold and can't smell anything to overcome my embarassment of not figurring this out to begin with and move to a corner or the next crowded car!     I think I was successful for about 3 mins or so and felt like throwing up and bolted into the next car and then the one after that.  WHEW!  Now the really funny , sad and disgusting part is that imagine that person who takes that seat when it's empty and thinking , what in the world is that smell.   Now I only ask to take this example and apply it pretty much to most of the seats in BART.   EWWWWWW!!!!!   That was the last time I took BART.   Thankfully as I'm in south bay /peninsula I try to take caltrain if needed.  I never see such packed crowds in caltrain, the have ameneties, you can drink , eat, plug in your laptop and have desks to work.  BART sucks except for the fact they're on time for most part. Few things BART should do to begin with.  Add more cars during commute hours!  Place trash cans, use Vinyl or hard seats (like VTA rails).   So every week all you need to do is just hose it down."
5,"Apr 15, 2012",Love Bart it saves me gas and time. All I have to do is sit and relax till I reach my stop.
1,"Oct 13, 2010","Is confusing. The website doesn't go into great detail. The pay machine is confusing.  I asked the lady who worked at the bart a question and she told me to ask her behind the glass window in rude voice. However, she stepped out and answered the question for a male who was infront of me. I was so upset, that I became stern with her..It makes me mad thinking of her actually..As a first time user of the bart, I was appalled at how rude and unhelpful the staff where there. The what seemed tourists at the station were more helpful and friendly.I felt confused with the set up. However, the color coding of different lines was good. I guess it gets easy over time..I have taken the tube (train) in london and metro (in montreal) and have found their systems to be more organized, helpful and friendly. In london, the tube workers at the station were not pissed off if you tried to ask them direction questions..I had a bad impression of the city after my upsetting bart experience..However, I went back to SF and rode the bus etc. and it was much better.."
2,"Mar 23, 2015","WARNING: I rode the BART from Oakland Airport to the Embarcadero in SF while en route to see our grandkids in Marin. The new Airport-Oakland link deserves 5 STARS. It is as good as any Euro train I've ridden. The Oakland-Embarcadero train reminds me of the NYC subway system under David Dinkins. BART's cars are dingy, it's windows are covered in an ugly yellow haze. The BART experience is like that of a Communist Country. Then, their are its outriders. At Fruitvale Station two black males entered our car. One was over six feet, muscular, and threatening. This male stood in the middle of the car and in a loud voice announced he needed financial assistance with some kind of payment. He made claims about being a veteran. I'm a veteran I was ashamed. When no one opened their wallets he became menacing and repeated his demand for help. One or two passengers opened their wallets. The other black male was smallish, wore dark sun glasses, and a black hoodie covering his head. He was wearing headphones and walked through the passenger car with a gangsta lope. I felt vulnerable and because I had no weapon - defenseless. If the above two characters were allowed free range then more will follow. BART is on the verge of lawlessness.  Policing needs to be increased! ""ALL LIVES MATTER"""
1,"Jul 27, 2015","First time using this going from Daly City to Embarcadero.  First, couldn't find station from freeway - no signs to encourage people to use it?  Impossible to figure out how to pay for parking (sign says pay at 'Pay Area' without telling you where it is).  Machines to buy tickets require you to spend 20 minutes figuring out how to buy four tickets to go to Embarcadero (not fun when you've got a line of people behind you).  On the way back, couldn't find the station at Embarcadero till I saw people going down stairs so I gave it a try.  Then stood in line to buy tickets but would take cash or ATM only.  Finally a person told me where to go to use a credit card.  Why no signs to tell me that?  Filthy stations, lack of helpful information to use the system, topped by nasty look from employee when I didn't know what to do with my ticket because the styles were all open.  Major negative experience.  Only works for people who have already learned the system and are willing to endure the stink."
4,"Sep 8, 2008","yo bart is pretty cool if you have a car. you need to take bart if youre from the bay! check your roots if you dont! this is one of the nicest stations. its pretty new. it probly just got remodled a few years back. yesh. pretty nice location. nice apartments outside. trader joes and costco right next to it. nice and clean. the only thing i dont like about bart is that it gets kinda loud sometimes, but overall very comfy and soft seats. better seats than caltrain."
1,"Jul 31, 2013",the customer service at bart is terrible. i had very bad experience with them. i went to the website and added a monthly pass by mistake. i called bart immediately and they told me it's all fine and i'll get a refund. i thought the pass has been revoked. i went to take bart after two days and then the monthly pass loaded to my clipper. i immediately called again and then i was told that i can't get the refund since i used the pass! i had enough clipper cash in my clipper card. and why i need to buy a pass when the month is almost finished? shame on you bart!!!
4,"Feb 22, 2007","it was an a typical day going home.  i fell into an odd state of defeat. or guilt. or something i didn't quite care for and entered an estranged state of mind.  i embarked myself on a home bound train and became the only person in my entire bart car.  i stood listening to my ipod and reading my book.  it wasn't my book.  i was standing there alone leaning against the pole with my elbow propped up and eyes glued to the pages.  i tried very hard to make reading my only existence to escape what could possibly be around me.  i concentrated, and not because of my mood, or that i was using it as a distraction, but because it was the single most remarkable dialog to ever be written and offered to me.  ever.  i didn't want to get off the train.  the empty car rocked but it was a smooth ride. i wanted to ride until the end of the line.  it never stopped.  the capsule swallowed me and sped on the tracks.  entering the east bay, it looked stormy but it was a mere facade.  speeding by, if the doors behind me opened up, my body would fold and be sucked backwards by a vacuum of swirling air, and then i would fan out, disentangle, and cartwheel through the open air!  the conductor was just a voice in my head, convincing me not to take it to the end.  'get off at your stop, while you can and not have the long journey home.'  but i retorted, 'but i like this, i want to be here alone. why won't you let me? i don't want to go home yet.'  his best argument was sheer silence. i couldn't fight it.  again, i felt defeated.  it was an underground travel now.  i closed my book.  it wasn't my book.  i straightened my neck, put the back of my head against the pole, shut my eyes, and it was more of just me with myself and it was heaven.  i was reflecting on and off of all that was shaded and indistinct.  bart gently forced me off as it came to a slow roll and i stepped onto the platform outside of my flying haven at ""my stop.""  i sighed as i walked toward the stairs gliding up them touching only every third step with one foot.  leaving the station, i scowled at the recorder player and had to face the outside world again with my keys in my hand."
5,"Apr 6, 2010","While I have no complaint about BART It gets me where I want to go, I do want to comment on its customer service. In January I was going down the escalator in BART and when I got to the bottom, my off white jacket and light green gloves were full of grease. Yuk! I went to the station agent and asked what to do. I was given a piece of paper and told to put in a claim. I did. I got a letter from BART telling me to contact the adjuster. When I did called them they had no idea about my case and had, in fact lost my case file. The gentleman said he would call me back. He didn't. I called him and they still hadn't found my file. Then two days later I got a nasty note from BART telling me to get a lawyer. I am so upset I don't know what to do. But I do know that I do not deserve to be treated this way I hope BART reads this. I don't think I should be expected to get a lawyer for a ruined coat and gloves."
1,"Aug 8, 2012","Beware of Bart of either their incompetence or their scam. I was parked legally at the Millbare station and was given a citation. I was parked there at 11:00am and a citation was given at 1pm. I figured the person who gave me the citation either got the # wrong, didn't check that I had paid or something was screwed up. In any case, I went online to appeal the citation. Don't think they even bothered to check if my claim was legit. They just sent me a letter 8 weeks later saying the claim is denied, the ticket is upheld with no explanation of why it was upheld nor why they ticketed me to begin with. I requested a second appeal which was also denied also with no explanation. I even sent them copies of my parking receipt to no avail. Now to try and resolve this $40 ticket they want me to pay a $20 processing fee and take a day off of work to appear in court. What nonsense. They probably expect people to just give up and they can earn their extra income on a bogus ticket. I'm sure they don't actually bother looking at these claims. They probably just ignore it until the person really makes the effort to get people in a room to discuss."
