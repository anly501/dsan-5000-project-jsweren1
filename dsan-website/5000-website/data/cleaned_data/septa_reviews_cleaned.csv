4,"Oct 6, 2023",I've been a SEPTA rider for over 50 years and I understand the value of the transportation system.
3,"Jun 23, 2023","The only game in town and they get the job done.Yes, they are often late. And criminal passengers abound.But you cannot blame SEPTA for these issues. Instead, fault the crooked leftwing politicians who create these problems that are destroying the city."
1,"Nov 10, 2023",Customer Service is horrible. Thank you SEPTA for:unsafe trains...late trains...overcrowded trains....dirty with urine and feces.needles. just figure out something else
4,"Nov 11, 2023","They have lately hired on trolley drivers who act responsibly and care for the well being of their passengers.  In Suburban Station in Philadelphia, I get all manner of hints and tips and good old-fashioned (but the most recently printed) paper maps and schedules for dealing with the more popular suburban routes.Before the pandemic, I used to be able to get some maps in the bookstore in the University City Shops at Penn Barnes and Noble/University of Pennsylvania Bookstore. Took up residence here a whole season before the onset of the pandemic. Yeah, nobody I knew here had the time or even the curiosity or inclination to just show me the lay of the land--moreover, they did not use public transit; except traveling in little groups where they did not have to always navigate (suburban matinee theatergoer or flower show special event dowager type, if they even deigned to staycate instead of leave town).  So I just had kept getting lost -delivery drivers kept me on watch, it had been BAD- because I do not do well with GPS; and people are on their earpods/earbuds and unfriendly sometimes; though to this day I need an excuse to talk to strangers...May as well be strangers with maps!"
1,"Aug 8, 2023",My morning was a serious sh't show.The plan was to ride with Hana to 30th street station.  Then she would of then taken the train to Wilmington Delaware.  She got in the line with her bike and payed the ticket fee to one Septa ticket person.  We wait the a good 20 minutes.  The train was supposed to be there at 6:55.  The train finally arrives and Hana since she has her bike asks to take the elevator.  She goes down the elevator and the train is already rolling away.  I'd also like to point out the Septa workers weren't letting her go to the elevator until the train arrived.So we waited all that time and  that train driver couldn't wait a good 1 minute or two?
2,"Jul 27, 2022","I decided to challenge myself and walk 10 minutes from my Jersey house to the PATCO line to 8th and Market, then switch to the Market Frankford Line to get to 30th Street Station and AMTRAK it to Boston, and then on to Portland, Maine by bus.The good news is that I survived.  Not going to lie, between all the crime and bad news lately, it was a bit nerve wracking, even though it was only 7:00 AM when I arrived, and on the way home it was about 7:00 PM.As a solo female traveler, I was very wary.  Everything smelled like bodily functions.  On the plus side, it was $2.50 each way for a couple of stops."
4,"Jan 3, 2018","It's so embarrassing, but I am one of those incredibly well traveled people who is short on experiences that other people take for granted. For example, for the past 20+ years, I've lived out west where public transportation wasn't really viable in the areas that I lived in.  Now I'm back to working in Philly and just recently, for the first time in my life, I used a Septa bus to get from Point A to Point B. Now don't get me wrong, I went up 11th St. to Reading Terminal and then turned around and went down 12th St. to get back to my office on a bus.  You would have thought I ran a freaking marathon, I was so proud of myself.My co-worker helped me and told me where to purchase the bus tokens and exactly which side of the street to stand on to catch the buses (I tell you, I was NERVOUS! What if I got on the wrong bus?  What if a bus never came? LOL).  Anyway, it was easy as pie - it wasn't crowded, I got a seat, I pulled the yellow cord halfway up the block before I needed to get off, yippee.I hope everyone's first time on public bus transportation goes as smoothly as mine did."
1,"Aug 30, 2023","2023 and the SEPTA app is a total disaster, it does not update when there is a cancellation on a particular route, and add drivers who although underpaid take out their frustrations on the public that uses this service to accomplish their daily task. This needs to be addressed from the top down, because the idiots at the top of the trash heap dumpster fire are they ones over paid and responsible for this crappy service. And who is the idiot in charge of the IT department that can't fix this app that a average middle schooler could have developed and made a better product."
1,"Apr 7, 2023",Just walk or ride a bike. unsafe trains...late trains...overcrowded trains.... dirty with urine and feces. needles. just figure out something else
1,"Aug 19, 2022",Simply unreliable. Buses will not show up at all (nevermind being late) and train stations are dangerous filled with junkies
2,"Jul 18, 2022","Philadelphia does have a fairly extensive transit system, but I wasn't impressed with it. The airport train was reasonably efficient, but had an extra charge, albeit not as outrageous as at some cities. The different trains were poorly integrated, and one had to walk from one station to another in some instances. The light rail wasn't working when I tried and a bus was running instead, but not on time. A train station closed me out before the last train of the day. The system was old, and the stations dirty. I wished I hadn't spent the money on day passes and instead had just gotten and airport ticket and walked. As a visitor who went multiple places that were very much on the train lines, they just weren't that helpful to me.Additionally, the card they have was quite strange and seemed set up as a quasi debit card, which is not what I'm looking for. If anything, I would want them to simply accept payments directly as some of the more advanced payment systems do, but this seems like an explicit step away from that."
1,"Oct 7, 2023",I have traveled in many cities. SEPTA is the absolute poorest public travel scheme that I have ever seen. Wasted tax dollars in the biggest of ways!!!!!
1,"Oct 4, 2023",Bus drivers don't show up when people have important appointments or they're late because they're fucking around. You get nowhere complaining. You can't get your money back when it's their fault. They think money grows on trees cause they're overpaid.
1,"Sep 26, 2023","I sat next to this simple bitch. She decided she wanted to sit next to the conducter in the four seat and take up three on Broad Ridge Line. I sat next to her bag taking up half a seat so I asked could she move her bag over. If I was a man it wouldn't have been a problem but since I am small and I had my bag. I had to get up and get off the train. I deal with simple MFs all day, simpl6bitch was grown. This is why people take regional rail...low class coming I don't know what kind of job you have... I for one can't loose my over assholes.  Beware of idiots pretending to be professionals.  But look really close"
1,"Jul 11, 2023","This is not intended to malign SEPTA or its employees, but to address certain procedures in place concerning buses idling in enclosed locations. Some of the drivers on the Route 135 bus in the West Chester Transportation Center are idling the buses for 20 minutes causing toxic diesel fumes and particulates to spread and adversely affect and harm the public, despite being in the confined space in the transportation center.  For about 4 months now I have been trying to get this problem resolved and only get recitations of a rule book or procedures manual or ignored completely by SEPTA.  Mitigating circumstances must be considered and no outside temperature should ever be a determining factor to allow bus motors to idle when people and buses are in close proximity to each other in a covered, walled garage."
1,"Sep 11, 2023",The most incompetent rail system in the country. Almost never on time and a horrible schedule. Stations are disgusting and full of homeless. Train move slower than I can walk half the time and it's overpriced for the horrible experience. If you can never ride septa. It's better to walk.
1,"Sep 9, 2023","Is nothing worse than schedule buses that never show up. All the time, I look on the schedule and the bus is coming every other one, according with that schedule. I know that, but i never know which one is not coming. So we're waiting in the bus station double the amount of time just because someone stupid enough is not doing his job! You are the worst public transportation in the entire world!!!!"
2,"Jun 21, 2023","My worst transit experiences come from the horrible bus drivers. More specifically the AM 127 drivers. Most mornings when I'm standing RIGHT NEXT to the bus stop for my 127 bus, the driver passes right by me when my hand is way in the air. They never stop if I don't put my hand up. I never have this issue coming back from Trenton but going to? I can safely assume the driver will pass by me and I have to Uber to work. You need to fire these people. Especially that older woman who was the 127 driver on 6/20/2023. She was swearing at pedestrians and cars so loudly I could hear it clear from the back of the bus."
1,"Nov 15, 2022","If I could give septa negative 5 stars. I would. The commuter bus, subway & market-Frankford transportation routes and deplorable & highly mismanaged. You have disgusting homeless and dope fiends doing whatever they want like smoking crack cocaine, using the vehicles for bathrooms, fighting, yelling and screaming on the destination's while children are in attendance.What use is your company if patrons can't get where they need to go on time?. Everyone from the very top on down need to be terminated and a new transportation entity should assume power.As I digress."
1,"Jan 17, 2023","The trains are always late! And they implemented their new septa key credit cards which you would think should've made it more convenient. Although, the chips in them never work so you can't get through the gates. Then they tell you to buy a new card but they charge you for it. I went through that once and brought a new card and the chip went bad on the second one as well. Their service is unreliable and a rip off. I never have these problems in other city's with their public transportation."
1,"Jul 22, 2022",The worst regional rail service in any city I have taken. I also take the train into the city daily for work the past few yrs. It is 9/10 times late in the morning and afternoon. Don't expect to get to work on time. I have even had a few instances where the train arrived early and left the station early before it's arrival time! I would not recommend using their service and will be driving myself in from now on.
1,"Sep 7, 2021",Morning commute or after noon. They always run late. And their new card system is horrible. The keypads never work at any station causing you to be more late then you already are
1,"Sep 8, 2016",One of the most unreliable transportation services to deal with. I take the train in/out of the city every day and have to catch one to two train times earlier than I would because they constantly are delayed. If you miss your train be prepared to sit around an hour before the next one comes... Assuming that one isn't running late
5,"Aug 17, 2022","The 5 stars are not for septa, or its services, because just yesterday I to take an Uber since the Route 20 that suppose to come at 10:08pm at Frankfort transportation center, never did.The 5 stars are for this gentleman  who is really making a difference in this company, and showed some love and respect and appreciation to us.So Thank you Sir   , and if I was decision maker you should be at least a supervisor trainer.He was driving route number 108 rom 69th street to the airport, which was super clean, and very welcoming."
1,"Jan 18, 2022","If there was 0  I would gave it, it's the worst service I ever used, the buses never on time and have no respect for the customers .Because of public works, they made a detour for the route 20 from Ashton rd to Welsh and asked us the wait for the bus at Welsh Rd..., however most of bus drivers refuse to stop on Welsh.I called the customer service, and nothing was done or changed, they just keep giving wrong promises."
1,"Jul 1, 2023",Septa is the most unreliable public transportation system out there. Do not use.
1,"Jun 28, 2023","Sometimes I take bus number 17 with my toddler daughter. Often, bus drivers depart even though they know the baby is not seated yet. Sometimes, they even leave at the bus stop while I'm trying to hold the baby and get on the bus together. Moreover, they are frequently not punctual. Unfortunately, the majority of drivers (9 out of 10) are far from being nice or polite, with only a few exceptions."
1,"Jun 28, 2023",Consistent issues with regional rail delays.  Trains are frequently not on time or experience significant delays on the tracks
1,"Jun 15, 2023",just horrible. Sad I take this just to go to work .  Bums and drug attics take over the El . the EL smell bad alwaya dirt . I have never seen a Cop on the el but get off at 15 market and see at least 10 . Is just ridiculous and unfair that I use it to commute back-and-forth to work I don't feel safe I don't even wanna sit down because the chairs are so filthy. They leave these dirty people on the train and it just makes the train smell so bad it's just unfair that I'm a paying customer and I constantly have to do with unsafe conditions.
1,"May 24, 2023","Always passing by people, they never stop to pick anyone up and then they give you that stupid look at you when they pass by you, they be doing it on purpose istg."
1,"Jul 29, 2022","Awful!! Rude customer service and people!Unfriendly, really bad people! Do not recommend riding or dealing with septa!"
1,"Apr 9, 2023","On Friday around 2:48 bus 8260 driving on Rising Sun the light before which is on Roosevelt this bus decides to speed up forcing me to almost hit oncoming traffic. Luckily I have a small vehicle. I don't know what Cracker Jack box the Septa drivers get their license from, more caution should be required! Maybe the driver needs to take a refresher course on driving etiquette it's not safe to be behind the wheel of something that large and drive it like you're in a bumper car. I understand that the roads are bad often times people swerve around them but you're in a bus!!!"
1,"Jan 22, 2023",One of the worst train service. They are not following their own schedule at all. Even on weekends they are following weekdays schedule. Everyone who look at the weekend schedule on app they needs to wait at least 45 minutes on station for the train. When I told this to septa - 723 crew member he says that we are following weekend schedule even though I was showing him the septa schedule on the septa application. The same happened multiple times that I lost my connecting train because of SEPTA's worst train schedule. I wish if I could rate them in minus stars because that's what they deserves.
3,"Dec 27, 2022",I use septa trains all the time and they are great and convenient but the ticketing system is a mess. The transition from selling tickets on the trains to requiring them be purchased before hand as well as the addition to turnstiles has not been a smooth one. These changes have never been communicated to travelers coming into the city from the suburbs therefore causing lots of unnecessary confusion. It's especially confusing for those that purchase quick trip tickets since you not only need your ticket to get on the train but also get off (something else that has never been communicated to travelers).
1,"Feb 2, 2022","Septa has always been horrible. Now here we are 2021 and SEPTA has been around for years so you would think they wouldve gotten better, NOT! They are the worst transportation system I have ever used. This new card system is the worst. They are unreliable, trains are dirty, unsafe drug/homeless infested, SPD is a joke and not to mention the employees. They are soooo rude and disrespectful. It's like for some reason they think they are better than people that uses SEPTA. You can't even ask them a simple question without getting an attitude in return. SEPTA needs to be demolished. The city doesn't need them, they aren't a convenience. I'm Sure this city will be ok without them, we do just fine when they leave the city stranded to go on strike. If they weren't around anymore people would make out fine in due time. I HATE SEPTA!!!!! I'm just about to stop using them altogether"
3,"Dec 26, 2017","I'd much rather ride the Septa than hang out in a Septic Tank, but that's just me.This station is directly across from Pops Water Ice in the heart of Old South Philly. It's pretty safe here but at the same time be careful if you're by yourself, especially when it's late night."
1,"Dec 29, 2021","I gave 1 star because I had to, septa is never on time and ots never their fault. The el cars are FILTHY the platform at FTC is even worse, piss everywhere and all you see is people walking around woth brooms, that's not cleaning. Trying to get an el car that isn't a safe injection site or a moving homeless shelter is job in itself.  I've watched the ""cleaning"" crew during COVID and they were cleaning the polls with a filthy dish towel no cleaning solution on them so they were basically cross contaminating every inch of the el car, there's used needles everywhere, let's not get into not one septa police officer around, you're told to text the septa cops  um sure excuse me Mr mcstabby can you not stab me yet I gotta text the cops ‍ they hired unarmed security guards which are useless. I'm late everywhere I go die to septas incompetence. Get an UBER forget this trash"
3,"Nov 29, 2017",S L O W.appears to need upgrade and a cleaning crew.Still much better than many cities.
1,"Aug 8, 2022","wish there was another option because this place will never change. times are horrible. trains will switch tracks with a barely audible announcement from a robotic voice, train employees rarely announce stops."
1,"Sep 26, 2022","The Philadelphia public transit system so more than garbage,let me explain. The bus drivers are the worst they act like they don't want to do their job. Now I understand people can be horrible to the drivers, but when you have to be to work at a certain time and you make sure you are at the stop early more than likely you will be waiting a full half an hour for the bus to show. This is true for routes 104, 110 . There has not been a day this week or any other that these two routes are going to be delayed. DO BETTER! Although I know  they won't."
3,"May 14, 2017","Even for a transit nerd it's difficult to come up with a Septa rating. How many points to deduct for the foul-smelling, dystopian walkways? Or a user-unfriendly fare system that refuses to provide even the basic conveniences like card-dispensing machines that have been around for years in supposedly anti-transit spots like San Diego?But the subway itself isn't terrible. I may have been stared at once or twice but I can't recall a single instance of anyone shouting threats at fellow riders, which has happened several times in LA. The regional rail has taken me to concerts in Ardmore and Glenside and a sightseeing walk in Wilmington. The buses are adequate and I've been pleasantly surprised to see them in South Philly on tiny streets where they almost don't fit.Septa has allowed me to consume 80,000 calories of cheese steaks and pork sandwiches without using a car."
1,"Jul 1, 2022","I lived in a few big cities. No other transit system is as bad as septa. Incredibly grumpy employees ( but hey, that's Philly). Late services. Just generally crap."
1,"May 25, 2022","Absolutely, the worst public transit I have ever encountered. I highly recommend moving to a city with more reliable transit. You will wait for hours before a trolley shows up. The septa schedule is a joke so don't bother learning it because they don't abide by it."
4,"Mar 25, 2022","I travel between on the SEPTA regional rail between Germantown and Center City. It's convenient, easy and efficient. The station I travel from/to most is Wayne Junction. It was renovated not too long ago and is reasonably clean and in good repair, if not exactly aesthetically uplifting. The trains I take (there are several to choose from when boarding at Wayne Junction) tend to be a few minutes off, but in my nearly six months of five-day-a-week commuting I've only been late to work once. (My Key Card is refilled automatically and I haven't yet figured out how much a one-way peak ticket costs, so I won't comment on the fare, but it is handy to have the automatic-refill feature and not to have to have cash on-hand.)  Sometimes the conductors are friendly and upbeat, often they appear indifferent/uncommunicative (but, with everyone wearing headphones or earbuds and/or glued to their smartphones I suppose one's impulse to be talkative and friendly might be dampened somewhat), and on occasion I've come across a SEPTA worker who is faintly hostile; I actually adjusted my schedule slightly several months ago to avoid having to interact with one such person. What else... Well, on the old trains (and they seem to outnumber the newer ones, at least on the routes I take) there is no information available other than what the conductor elects to impart, and often they elect to be silent. On the newer-model trains the information is displayed on monitors (alongside advertising) as well as announced in a computerized voice, which means you  are spared the regional dialect/disinclination to articulate, emanating from speakers that distort, but sometimes the details on the monitors/computerized voice announcement are not correctly synched and will announce, for example, that you're approaching a station that was actually a couple stops back. What's more, the information on the app, on the signs at the stations and on the exterior of the train tends to be inconsistent, which can be quite confusing for someone who's trying to figure out an unfamiliar route. It will go something like this: on the app it will say ""Airport,"" on the sign at the station it will say ""Newark,"" and on the exterior of the train it will say ""Center City."" So apparently the only way to be sure is to go by the train number. Here's a parting thought: Maybe, now that the pandemic seems to be, well, not so acute at the moment, the conductors could encourage people to use all the seats. As it is now, two people will sit in one of those three-seat rows, but often the two-seat rows will have only one person in them, and that person will place their backpack or purse or luggage on the empty seat. If people no longer are required to ""social-distance"" it might be a good idea to remind passengers to be courteous."
1,"Apr 21, 2021","A disgrace for such a great city. I have been taking regional rail 5 days a week for years now. Only continues to get worse. Poor reliability and frequent delays are only the start. Employees are rude to passengers. Mask mandates are poorly enforced, even many ""conductors"" cannot seem to figure out how to cover their noses. You find conductors sleeping, eating, leaving doors open, hanging out of doors on moving trains, arbitrarily making their own rules, and harassing passengers on a regular basis. Regional rail really needs to be fixed, and it starts with hiring the right people and letting the wrong people go."
1,"Jan 2, 2022","Literally the worst public transportation service in the entire world. Trains busses trolleys regional rails are all DISGUSTING! Recks of urine and shit. Trash everywhere homeless people literally live on the train with their bags and whatever they own taking up all the seats. Drug users shoot up and overdose on trains or fall onto tracks causing delays on top current delays. You're bound to be robbed, raped, or assaulted and septa police are never anywhere to be found. The drivers are so ignorant and miserable. They have no information about routes or their job in general. They are so rude for people who deal with the general public. None of the routes are never on time or never show up at all. You're lucky if you get an older drive and ride that same route everyday they'll wait for you but other than that your SOL. They raise the fair every 2 years anywhere from 2-5 dollars. They implemented a fare card which also wasn't clearly thought through. You have to pay $5 for the card or load it with money. If you don't have enough on the card and use it they'll let you over draft it then you can't use it until you pay the overdraft. If you lose the card or it's stolen you have to pay an additional $5 to get a new one. You can only get a card from major septa stops such as 69th st city hall or Frankfort, if they even have any windows open to purchase one. The machines they have at other local stops are always out of order or malfunction and take your money without giving you the fair you purchase and they don't even care. When the pandemic occurred I had $200 on my fare card. They didn't even give me the money back. Told me I had to mail in a claim wait for septa to review the claim and then wait for them to send me a check in the mail just to get my money back. They consistently go on strike leaving the city in shambles because that's the only form of public transportation, even lord doesn't know how long the strike will be and they still won't refund you your money that is on your fare card so if you purchase a transpass while their on strike you wasted $25.50 yes 25.50 for a weekly pass gone to waste and no one cares. If you can save yourself the headache learn how to drive catch Uber or Lyft. Septa is trash and needs to be shutdown."
1,"Jan 2, 2022",Worst transportation company in the world. Never on schedule and disrespectful employees
1,"Oct 13, 2019","Septa sucks. They always have and they always will. My list of complaints go all the way back to my teen age years when  I had to rally for rides to school because of their strikes. They certainly didn't mind inconveniencing an entire city so why should I be surprised when on the night of this year's Ye Shi Chinatown Night Market the number 48 bus detoured and didn't bother to inform the public. The bus driver going down didn't mention it, there was no sign at any of the stops along the way and if that would have been just too much of a foot effort perhaps someone at a desk with a computer could have put an alert up on the website. The supreme worst."
2,"Aug 21, 2022",philly needs to fix this whole purchase a card to get in and out of the paoli thorn dale regional rail. either put the payments on a smart phone app or don't require me to purchase a card that you guys barely sell. every kiosk was broken!!! I tried to use that first and failed and waiting in a second line to purchase a ticket would have taken 20 minutes at minimum! So  wait 40 minutes to get a key pass?!? lmao what a joke this process should take less than 10 minutes to pay for public transit
2,"Feb 12, 2022","Recently I started commuting by bus to work. I ride the L bus to Plymouth meeting mall. I get on, greet the driver, pay with cash and I'm met with impatience and arrogance in response. The bus typically arrives on time. That is why I gave 2 stars instead of one. I think the response is due to me not using a key card. I do not plan to purchase one at this time. I'm given the option to pay with cash, so all though it takes a few more seconds to pay my fair, my money is acceptable."
1,"May 29, 2019","Awful awful awful.  I have been in many cities with a comprehensive transit system.  This one is barely that.  They have Regional Rail, trains, trolleys, and buses.  The transit map is like a mush of all of those; it is very difficult to come up with a best route, even with Google Maps.  And even if you do, it usually starts with a trolley or bus, and you first have to find a place to buy a pass or have exact cash for a one way ride on the trolley or bus, then spend more money on the pass.And their fares are whacked.  I bought what I thought was a one-day pass for SEPTA.  That was the Convenience Pass, and it didn't include Regional Rail.  The Independence Pass includes Regional Rail.  I would say do your homework, but I did that and still couldn't figure it out.It is also a bit unclear how you are supposed to get the trolleys to stop and pick you up.  Buses make more sense, but even there the signs for the stops are difficult to see.I can't believe I am saying this, but you might want to have transit as a backup only in Philadelphia until you've gotten a better sense of it.  Once they have ticket machines at all of the stations that help you pick the right ticket based on your transit usage for the day, I will be more committed."
1,"Dec 30, 2021",HORRIBLE service. Key cards don't work buses are always late and now always canceled without notice! It's a shame that this is the only service we have to rely on. There service is bad and always want to raise the fare!
1,"Apr 1, 2021","At the bright young age of 24, I have come to accept I will live my life disappointed with inefficiencies that the world offers. Today, that inefficiency is Septa transportation.             I started my trip to see my cousin nothing short of optimistic. I had a great workout on my girlfriends mother's peloton, had a great shower, my girlfriend had just picked out my clothes and dressed me nicely, I had no complaints in the world. I arrived at the train station, and it was completely vacant. Is there anyone I can talk to about how these magical trains run? They don't exist in Nashville. I sit in the parking lot for 10 minutes, optimism still pretty high.               The train finally comes 6 minutes late, and an unkind middle aged obese white male (the worst kind of white male for the ""woke leftists"" out there) opens the train doors and yells ""CASH ONLY OR KEY CARD"" I kindly explain I do not have cash or a key, no signs identified it was cash only or key, and the younger generations do not run on cash. He yelled out ""SORRY BUD, if you don't have cash or key you can't hop on board!"" And kept the train moving.               Back to my original statement: ""I have come to accept I will live my life disappointed with inefficiencies that the world offers""               How would this system improve, a ""scholar"" or ""expert"" may ask?              1) have a train station Venmo, cash app, zelle, Bitcoin, gofundme, onlyfans, whatever source available to give money. You cannot expect to operate like it is 1990, the world is constantly adapting. As a business or human, it is your job to analyze the adaptation and make it advantageous to yourself. This man and this business failed.               2) if idea 1 is too rational, have signs EVERYWHERE saying ""CASH ONLY"".               2a) if you are going with idea two (a worse idea, but better than no idea) , have on speakers ""CASH OR KEY CARD ONLY"" every minute and have an ATM and key card machine at every train station. Even if it's a robbery ATM (every ATM that wants $3 or more is a robbery ATM) it's better than no ATM.                3) have a square card that you can swipe with, if many Uber drivers can obtain the $49 square card how in the world can you not?                4) technology is the future, either ""hop on board, Venmo, cash, credit card and onlyfans accepted!"" or die a slow painful death. And BAD news septa, you don't get the nice death our ancestors got when you failed to successfully hunt or gather food and the whole family starved. Today, it is often a 30-50 year process of slow degeneration, loss of value, loss of reputation, and then best case, being bought out by someone intelligent who could run the business successfully, and worst case, you go bankrupt and board up the windows and sell the property to mice, bugs, and dust. YOUR CALL SEPTA! You can't say I didn't warn you"
2,"Apr 26, 2018","Probably the most confusing subway line that I have ever used in the world. The only positive is that the workers do try to help and don't treat tourists like shit. I guess I have 1 more positive, it doesn't smell that much like urine. The stations are confusing if you are transferring lines and they don't have a thingie you can see which tells you when the next train will arrive. Prices are high imo as well. $9 for a one day pass but it is not unlimited (only 8 trips...no reason why), and it isn't 24 hours (say from 11am-11am the next day) but calendar day which is frustrating. The airport train (despite being using it) doesn't leave as frequently as I would have liked. Honestly even if you are a solo traveler, I think Uber would end up saving you time and a headache. Because I spent my first day using public transport only, I missed out doing something I had planned on going for the day."
2,"Feb 17, 2020","It will never ceases to amaze me how rude and uneducated the train conductors are. Tonight the Lansdale line, formerly R5, insisted he was right so loudly he proved himself wrong on so many levels.

Then, I won't respect them either and save."
1,"Mar 14, 2021","Train line from the 1800s. Constant confusion, rude employees, and far outdated technology. I've seen employees yell at people who weren't native English speakers for misunderstanding them. I've also been dropped off at stop with no warning on a day when busses replace trains, only for the busses to be scheduled for 2 hours later. Probably the worst service in Philadelphia and this is the same city that Comcast calls home..."
1,"Jun 3, 2019","The fact that this organization still exists says more about the rotten corruption within this this state. This company makes no decisions with the customer's best interests in mind. In fact, some of their protocol may lead one to believe that SEPTA really doesn't want anyone to ride their vehicles. They can't go a solid week without mechanical breakdowns, manpower issues, signal or switch issues. They can't make it through one entire contract length without the threat or an actual strike, leaving everyone stranded while their operators kick and scream to get what they think they're worth. And now, with the SEPTA Key feature (a prepaid fare card that was obsolete on the day they broke ground on it), all early adopter cards will expire in July and guess what happens? Nothing! You lose your card and your way to work unless you go to a SEPTA key kiosk and BUY a new card, THEN go to a full service SEPTA key counter (wherever they are[?], they are usually closed when you're available to visit) so that you can transfer to a whole new account, THEN you have to realign whatever financial source you had directly depositing into your FSA account. They are lazy. They are not smart. They are mean and unhelpful. And they're a necessary evil if you ever want to get to work. They are the worst part of every single day."

1,"Oct 1, 2020",Septa is so awful and inconvenient. The buses are constantly late and if they're not late then they either don't show up at all and occasionally are too early compared to the scheduled time that you miss it anyway. It is so unreliable. If you need to get somewhere at a scheduled time plan on being late since you never know when they're actually going to show up. The worst city transportation
2,"May 19, 2018","The employees are average to slightly better than average in attitude. It's what you'd expect when you think of Philly.The biggest negatives are for a city the size of Philadelphia, two subway lines is substandard. Somewhere along the line, someone dropped the ball here. Compatible cities have twice as many lines. Over reliance on buses only creates more traffic on the city's narrow and old streets. Not to mention more than half the time, buses are not just a few minutes late, but in  many cases so late that it causes missed connections and frustration. Many times, I've been able to walk faster than the buses!The street car lines are a patchwork of forgotten dreams. Regional rail, in particular, the airport line runs only every 30 minutes and is nearly always full. PHL is a major hub that needs more frequent service.Connecting tunnels and stops in center city are a mess with few signs. Some transfers are free. Others are not with no other reason than someone didn't bother to build the appropriate tunnel.We needn't compare SEPTA to far superior systems in Europe or Japan. We only need to look at places like Portland, Oregon with 3, soon to be 4 light rail lines, a robust street car and bus system. In many cases, unlike Philly, these are green connected to either natural gas or electric lines. All of this, and Portland is half the size of Philadelphia!Improvements are being made, but nothing significant that will bring the service into the 21st century. Right now, they are struggling to get into the 1990s."
5,"Apr 4, 2019","Name of this transit system could have a better ring it. Perhaps rebranding could lead to more 5 stars, who knows, just food for thought. Otherwise great service. Got from point A to point B on my last experience. Thank you"
1,"Mar 29, 2019","I appreciate that Philly has public transportation because that is good for the environment, but SEPTA goes out of its way to be awful.  Employees are rude and sometimes even nasty.  The trains show up any random time they please.  The stations are filthy.  The employees won't do anything about making sure that the quiet car is in any way actually quiet.  I have contacted SEPTA numerous times with complaints and suggestions and typically get no response.  SEPTA's poor service is why so many people drive instead.  Philly can do better."
3,"Mar 26, 2019","Usually gets the job done. Mostly on time, rarely more than a couple minutes late. Some of the older trains need to be replaced. Also lots of homeless people in the Center City stations."
3,"Jun 6, 2020","Even though they never responded to any phone calls, many months later I was paid for the damage from the accident. SEPTA needs to modernize. We could be better than BART! We don't have to be some stodgy, old place that reeks of 1920's response times, slow-pope bureaucracy, ""we will respond when we decide to respond"" psychology. Customer Service needs to means something everywhere and all the time."
2,"Oct 9, 2018","My check showed up 8 months later. SEPtA never corresponded, talked about the issue or communicated with me the entire time I waited for a response."
1,"Aug 8, 2017","A SEPTA Trolley knocked my mirror off with me and passengers as a witness. After 6 hours of paperwork, pictures, estimates and mailings, they don't bother to even return a phone call. Apparently nobody cares not even the PADOT. If this happens to you you got to be in a position to get their attention, so makes sure all your injuries are evaluated and lawyer-up for the occasion."
1,"Jan 13, 2020","They are unreliable especially during rush hour.  The MFL never is running on time or with enough trains.  For the past two weeks, there have been two separate occasions during rush hour where the MFL is significantly delayed causing me to either take a Lyft or get to work late.  It's fucked up that septa isn't held accountable for offering more reliable transportation; think of how you affect people's livelihood."
1,"Jan 4, 2020","I planned on taking family during the holidays to Philadelphia with the family independence pass.   Because our local station doesn't have a ticket booth or ticket machine, customer service said we could buy the pass on the train.  The conductor then said we cannot buy the ticket on the train and must do it it at the station, and perhaps the agent at our destination could discount our return fare.   At Jefferson station, the agent said she could only give us a $1.50 discount per ticket off the full fare round trip price.    Her response was that we had to buy the family independence pass in Philadelphia (?!?) to use at a later date - in order to get into Philadelphia.    This is completely crazy, and in fact would have cost us less money to drive into the city.   It was a very disappointing experience."
2,"Nov 20, 2018",I've seen better from the LIRR! No restrooms onboard! Why are there no restrooms on any of their trains?! Staff is somewhat friendly. Tickets cost about the same as an off peak LIRR when you use an NJT machine (they need their own machines in Trenton). Train interiors look outdated. They only use 2 cars instead of the whole train .  Better off on Amtrak getting to 30th St.
1,"Aug 24, 2018",This is the stupid and slowest trains I had ever seen ... I don't why they run so much slow ... it's stupid... people are paying money but here it's wasting time...trains look very clean and good but it takes so much time to reach from 1 station to other and just stops wherever and whenever doesn't even move for so much time
1,"Aug 12, 2017","Terrible, always either late, too early, or doesn't come at all with no warning! Unfortunately they have a monopoly on public transit so they can do things like raise the fare without warning, be rude to customers, and make it impossible to get to work safely and on time."

1,"Feb 1, 2017","This company doesn't even deserve 1 star but anyways, I've been taking the regional rail everyday for the past 4 years because it's my only way into the city. The trains are always late sometimes by 5 or 30 minutes or even an hour late. Sometimes they even just cancel trains all together. It's completely unorganized, the trains always have ""maintenance or equipment problems"" & good luck if you're trying to take it in the winter. I cannot emphasize enough how consistently late the trains are. It's horrible, frustrating & God forbid that it's important that you need to be somewhere on time of you have to take SETPA transportation.I took the NJ Transit regional tail to New York every day during the summer & sometimes in the fall and winter & NEVER did I have the same severe issues I had with SEPTA. BY THE WAY, not only are they always late & unreliable, when they go on strike (which happens more than it ever should) it's a DISASTER. The whole city practically shuts down, nothing is running & if it is, it's completely packed and unsurprisingly late. & then they refuse to give you your money back for a weekly or monthly pass."
3,"Jan 2, 2019","I am a regular SEPTA user as I travel via regional rail 5x a week. While the usual public transposition delays/issues occur a event happened that is worth mentioning. Recently I forgot my wallet on the train during my morning commute. Throughout my process of trying to locate it I interacted with various SEPTA personnel. I was helped by the staff at the University City station gate on South Street, main station entrance and those working in the booth. I also talked to the Suburban Station information desk staff and those in the passenger office at lost and found in person as well as on the phone. My call was answered in a timely matter. While this was a stressful time for me every single one of the staff were kind, patient and helpful! I received various suggestions and information as to where I could most likely find my wallet. After being directed to fill out a lost item form at suburban I was called that same evening that my wallet had been found by a conductor. I wanted to thank each person and SEPTA as a whole for their help and reassurance throughout this process!I was truly impressed by your costumer service."
1,"Aug 20, 2018","Beware SEPTA's ""improved"" fare system!  SEPTA is in the process of rolling out bits and pieces of its ""new, better"" farecard system called The Key. If you're a regular commuter it's fine - you no longer have to carry tokens and change. But if you're a visitor or occasional rider, FUGEDDABOUDIT!  It's as if the so-called planners who put the Key system together managed to find everything they could to make its use inconvenient and expensive for anyone who isn't riding 9-5 on Monday to Friday.- If you don't have a Key card, you have to pay an extra 50¢ when boarding a bus or trolley. On the train system, you have to pay anywhere from $1.25 to $1.75 extra. On top of that, without a Key card you don't get a break if your trip requires transferring to a second vehicle - you have to pay a full fare for each transfer. So why not just get a Key card, you ask? Hey, this is SEPTA! Key cards are only available at certain locations, and there's a $4.95 fee to buy the card. Yeah, you get the $4.95 back as a fare credit if you go online and register your card but how many tourists will be returning to Philly in time to make use of the credit?  - It's at least possible to buy single-ride tickets (at the higher, surcharged rate, of course) from vending machines at maybe half of the subway stations. At the others, you need to have exact change to board. Yes there are ticket-booth attendants but they're NOT ALLOWED TO MAKE CHANGE!  Unless you've got the right bills and coins you have to round up to whatever denomination(s) you have in your wallet.  On the commuter train lines about 2/3 of the stations actually have ticket offices staffed by live humans, but the offices are only open limited hours. If the office is closed or non-existent you have to pay in cash on the train - again subject to that $1.25-$1.75 surcharge. - If that's not enough, those shiny new contactless e-pads installed in many stations and on vehicles? They only work with the Key card - credit card or mobile app payments aren't accepted. As a transit advocate it hurts deeply to say this, but if you're a visitor Uber's starting to look pretty good. SEPTA just _might_ be OK if you're only going to use it once in your life. Otherwise, it's simply not worth trying to navigate the rat's nest of fare limits, surcharges and just plain ""gotcha"" rules that the Key has brought on."

The service is expensive and if you forget to buy your monthly pass on the first day of the month, you have to pay an extra ticket on the train (~$6) even if you're buying the monthly pass anyway after that. They won't give you a refund for every time a train is cancelled without previous notice, for every delay. In other words, they can be as bad as a service as they want and you still have to pay... they claim to be the a transit authority... THEY'RE NOT."

The ticket counter was a breeze and we boarded (I think it was sometime around 7:50am). Conductor 446430 came by to collect tickets. We were unsure of how the tickets worked, and just handed them to the conductor and asked about the return tickets. The conductor punched the tickets and said there aren't any return tickets. You see he had just punched our return ones also.. A person in our group asked some questions and the conductor raised his voice really loud and said ""calm down""! The person from our group was calm and simply asked for information. In that moment I began to feel uncomfortable. Conductor 446430 proceeds to talk in his raised voice and basically yell that we have disabled tickets. He then turns towards my child and says in an even more rude tone "" I don't know how old these kids are""! After he gave us some papers to correct the error, it still wasn't over. On our way back we found out the papers he gave to correct the mistake stopped in Hamilton and not Trenton from where we boarded. Thanks a lot conductor 446430"

To say the experience was unpleasant is indeed an understatement.  Septa does not have enough cars on the trains which results in severe overcrowding and the cars that are being used are not in a good state of repair.  The temperature during this past Labor Day week were in the upper 90's and the air conditioning was not working properly.  On one occasion when returning home from a terrific day at the Kimmel Center the Septa train lost power and we were trapped at North Philadelphia station in the blistering heat.  In my opinion Septa simply does not care and is focused on their bottom line."

The employee wearing a yellow vest and directing the passengers how to ride the train mislead me when I wanted to purchase a ticket. She told me that I won't need one since I am senior. I showed her my Florida Id driving license and she gave me the green light to board the train. Well it was not true. The train employee charged me the cost of the ticket plus a fine for not having purchased the ticket prior to board the train. When I complained, he strongly suggested me to write a letter to the company and ask for a refund. I did it and got a response written by Supervisor Anthony Fl Natale denying the refund. If I only knew it, I won't waste my precious time writing a letter, mailing it and waiting more than one month for a negative response.

Onboard the employee charged me the fee plus the fine and suggested me to write a letter to the company's refund department which I did attaching the ticket and explaining the incident. After more than one month, I received a letter with the ticket back denying the refund.

I called customer service to complain but I just got some clarity on the matter, had to call twice first true clarity and rush is a discretionary time I learned and the conductor could still say no during any other time. I came prepared with my bike lock just in case this issue came about, I asked twice to let lock it up being as though there are many poles, right where you board at that. I was pulled off on both times even with explaining I was told to wait on the second train, even still asking to just let me lock my bike up. As I turned to lock up both times they shut the doors and rode of, funny thing is I do have a car which is why riding is periodical. Lesson learned the hell with supporting Philadelphia transporting and the jobs of those who are clear a%%holes.

1,"Mar 16, 2016","It's amazing how such a big company can't have things organized. I live in Telford, PA, don't drive. I use bus 132. Septa busses are NEVER reliable! They are ALWAYS late, about 10 times they didn't come at all, when they were supposed to. Later it would turn out that a bus broke in its way or a driver would be new and didn't know where to go. But how are people supposed to know that?? Standing at a bus stop in the rain or snow, how are they supposed to know when even Septa's app doesn't work properly and nothing tells you why a bus is being late or  not coming at all . And how about people who don't have smartphones or have no idea how to use an app? People at customer service are not necessarily helpful every time. What surprises me the most is why not to make busses come every half an hour or at least every hour? Why does the life of those who don't drive has to depend on a bus schedule? Your bus comes once in 2 hours, go ahead, plan your day!"

Who wants to carry a bunch of tokens around?Otherwise - way cleaner than NYC buses, and people are far more appropriate."
